you ever go astray\nYou can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink\nYou can give a man some wisdom but you can't make him think\nCoz\nStitch in time saves nine\nThe early bird gets the worm\nBut all you can think about is getting a touch-up on your perm\nIf knowledge is power and power is knowledge, then\nHow so many idiots be graduating from colleges?\nBetter to be silent than be thought a fool\nThan to speak and remove all doubt\nYou know what I'm talking about\nWhen opportunity knocks you better let him in and sit him on down\nAnd try to be his friend\nIn order to be a

leader is a damn good teacher and\nImagine if you was in a car and your life was a race\nSomebody was on your back and you had to give him some space\nPut the pedal to the metal where it match at
