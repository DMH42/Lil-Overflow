gone mad?\nIf you don\u2019t like how I raised you then go live wit your dad\u2019\nI become quite upset, angry enough to war!\nStart stompin all across the floor then I slammed ma room door!\nAn act of disobedience which is the wrong ingredients\nAll it takes is jus one tiniest form a insight from a genius\nTo put it in perspective, video jukebox you selected\nCampaign around this town,with this beat and get elected\nHussler on the doe, hitting hard like ridd\nSome of our raps are fast, some of our raps are slow\nV town, California, where I born raised and grow\nMy favourite animated TV show, Tennessee Tuxedo\nEtcetera,etcetera,etcetera,me no smoke cocaine\nToo hard on my brain, might drive me insane\nLyrical king, the lyrical king,E-40 the lyrical king (x2)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nE-40 wanna slowin it up, tippin ma cup\nTo make a toast (boop, boop, boop) for 90 dos\nOr what I say\nPeace goes out to d CLICK drivin on me insane\nWith that premeditated game, a yea\nNow pass d drink to

(a say a), drink it  up until yo ocha\nIf the munchies didn\u2019t go , write some riddles add some symbols\nMake up symbols, can\u2019t resist em\nNow everybody sing da lingo\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nWhy don\u2019t you like drop d lyrics wit d greatest effies\nHow come you can\u2019t spit the lyrics from the hillside posse\nNo good times could d one times make our country not free\nI thought this was the land of the opportunity", "[Intro:]\nBe all on that shit right there mane\nI be the same nigga though on the real though\n\n[Hook:]\nYou niggas better duck
