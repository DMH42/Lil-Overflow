{"Immortal Technique": ["[Part I: Dance with the Devil]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI once knew a nigga whose real name was William\nHis primary concern was makin' a million\nBein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen\nHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams\nA corrupted young mind at the age of 13\nNigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\nHer son's heart simultaneously grew colder\nHe started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects\nCheckin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects\nHe was fascinated by material objects\nBut he understood money never bought respect\nHe built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal\nBut got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal\nSo criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real\nYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equal\nI don't project my insecurities in other people\nHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\nSo he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\nA feeble-minded young man with infinite potential\nThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental\nCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\nDancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed\nBut he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed\n\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do\nTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\nStartin' fights over little shit up on the block\nStepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock\nWorkin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\nFulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\nTired of the block niggas treatin' him the same\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nBut when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love\nThey told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\nBut only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die\nStandin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\nSuggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\nSo now he had a choice between goin' back to his life\nOr makin' money with made men up in the cyph'\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\n\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'\nSmokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone\nThree in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nWalkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\n\"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw\"\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nScreamin', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!\"\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'\nBlood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\nRippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned\nWhen they were done and she was lyin'\nBloody, broken and bruised\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\n\n[Sample]\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\n\n[Verse 4]\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nAnd he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\n'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother\nShe looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nWorkin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nAnd cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared\nBut only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\nAnd listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true\n'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\nIn fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows\nAnd every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow\nHe could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nWhite, brown, yellow and black \u2014 color is not restricted\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted\nAnd you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never\nBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever\n\n[Part TII \"I\"]\n\n[Intro: Immortal Technique]\nOh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?\nWell, it\u2019s not, you didn\u2019t count on a fallen angel gettin' back\nInto the grace of God and comin'

receiving circuits\nBy unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches\nWhat you preach is worthless\nYour worship defeat the purpose\nLike President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service\nBeyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em\nShow no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm\nTour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend\u2019s dick\nIn the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist\nDiabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague\nFist-fuckin\u2019 a pussy\u2019s face, holdin' a hand grenade\nSo if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you\u2019re less than nothin'\nI just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nYou motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me\nI\u2019ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army\nStorm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I\u2019m on a mission\nTo split your body into a billion one-celled organisms\nImmortal Technique\u2019ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch\nYou\u2019re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix\nI\u2019m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips\nArsenic language transmitted

niece\nI\u2019ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me\nAnd then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy\nThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology\nSo you\u2019re nothin', like diversity without equality\nAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology\nUsin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven\nProduces more digits than 22 divided by seven\nYou\u2019re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect\nYou never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet\nYour mind is empty and spacious\nLike the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist\nFace it, you\u2019re too basic, you\u2019re never gonna make it\nLike children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked", "[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\nShe was on her way to becomin' a college graduate\nWouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid\nThe type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with\nFuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire\nDisciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire\nFlyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez\nEveryone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless\nAt first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids\nThe thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids\nBut the rich sniff-coke kids got no play\n\"I'm not even interested\" is what her body language would say\nEveryone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it\nIt didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it\nOn the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it\nTalk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it, \u2018cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it\nAnd no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick\nSmokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it\nShe spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy\nBut when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy\nShe had a style, all her own, respectful and pure\nI was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all

eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad\nI used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad\nThat I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it\nSo every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute\nI didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours\nOn her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers\nThen I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower\nWe talked about power to the people and such\nWe spent more time together, but it was never enough\nI never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel\nI was too interested in keepin' it real\nPerfectly honest and complete\nShe would always call me \"cari\u00f1o\" and never Technique\nBought me a new book to read every two or three weeks\nForever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak\nIt was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks\nShe convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets\nTo stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you\nInstead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo\nMuseo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too\nGot to the point when I was either with her or my crew\nSo I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true\nI couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears\nBut honey's only response was a face full of tears\nShe could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight\nI tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight\nI felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light\nExcept I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nIf I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI went on with my life, college and my career\nEnded up locked up like an animal for a year\nWhere the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer\nThen I got sent to the hole when my exit was near\nAt night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her\nHold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared\nJust an empty cell until the state gave me parole\nIn the summer, came back, intact and on track\nBut the fact of the matter is I still felt cold\nEven after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home\nMy real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone\nFuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone\nRelatively well-known around the New York underground\nBut I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down\nThe sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair\nThough gone physically, somehow it was still there\nI had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear\nSo I went and visited the building where she used to live\nThe world looks a lot different after you do a bid\nThe way your life done changed\nWhile primitive minds are still stuck in the same game\nLike her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine\nStepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name\nHer mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta\nBut her facial expression changed\nWhen I asked about her daughter\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and

know\n\n[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]\nShe told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind\nAnd she had left it there waitin' for such a long time\nI was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first\nI saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed\nShe told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst\nReversed my position, stepped over and opened the door\nAnd sure enough there was an envelope\nWith my name on the floor: \"Nobody loves you more than me, cari\u00f1o,\" is what the letter said\n\"By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead\nBut when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven\nI thank God at least I got to know what love really was\nBut it hurt me to see what true love really does\n\u2018Cause even though we never made love\nYou were all that there was\nIt was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave\nYou made me doubt the way I thought\nYou made me want to believe\nAnd then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me\nIt was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me\nThis was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be\nBaby, don't you see?\nI had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV\nHope didn't exist for me since late in 1993\nI died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you\nI cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you\nPromise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably\nNo matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.\"\nWhat happened for the rest of the day is still a blur\nBut I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her\nShe was buried on August 3rd\nThe story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people\nHold the person that you love closely if they're next to you\nThe one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you\nAppreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond\n\u2018Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone", "[Intro]\nYeah, it's

They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed\n\nNiggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that. The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you. There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely, and I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem. Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism. You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials. But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources\n\nI'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words. My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others\n\nYou see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America. Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States; places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well\n\nAs different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined. And that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques\n\nBut you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people. \"Fuck them, let them fend for themselves.\" No, fuck you, they are you. No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them. They're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in. And whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us\n\nI want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living. No, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money. We have whatever they kick down to us. My enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies. The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real motherfuckers that I need to bring it to, not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up\n\nIn fact, I have more in common with most working and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people. As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue. Many of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie motherfuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole\n\nIn other words, I don't want to escape the plantation I want to come back, free all my people, hang the motherfucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground. I want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land\n\nYou cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil. I don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole. Most of those successful individuals are sell-outs and house-negros\n\nBut, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto. Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor. That's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture, and forms of government. You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois League. The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of White Spaniards once he was captured. Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans\n\nSo in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community and represent what's good for all of us proletariat\n\nPorque sino entonces te mando por el carajo cabron gusano hijo de puta, seramos libre pronto, viva la revolucion, VIVA LA REVOLUCION", "[Intro]\nYeah, nigga.

We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the well-being of the people; it's only about profit. Everything else\u2014their image, their human resources, their public relations\u2014only exist to protect the reality behind it. Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us, and so they privatized everything. Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart. They didn't care about our survival or well-being\u2014they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources. They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism, and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them. Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy, and that we would have freedom, but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom, the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table. Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God\n\n(Open your eyes before you die)\n\nAnd while some used missionaries and donations to off-set this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease, and sanctions that killed millions. They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enabled them, and stored them and kept them in power. They became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, governments of thievery. They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits. The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy, and even overthrow democratically elected governments. And so the age of revolution began again. They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market. But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself. It is manipulated like a puppet, and it survives because of its image. Destroy the image, and the enemy will die. Such is the same in the rap industry. But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World. When they need new assets, new artists to prostitute a side-ins, and put on a shelf to use their songs; when they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the Third World. They took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us. But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need them to succeed. They're no better than us. Their economic advertising was always a lie. A few got rich, but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure. Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelry, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide genes, 20-year contracts, and oil blood money. Build your defenses, my independent brothers and sisters. They\u2019ll stop at nothing to get what they want. They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward. But the super powers are no less corrupt; they've just learned to disguise it better, \u2018cause they fix elections too, they embezzle tax money, they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit. And when there's enough at stake, history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own presidents\n\n(WAKE UP!)\n\n[Ronald Reagan recording]\nJust as the Columbia represents man's highest aspirations in the field of science, so too does the struggle of the Afghan people represent man's highest aspiration for freedom, and I am dedicating on behalf of the American people the March 22nd launch of the Columbia Space Shuttle to the people of Afghanistan", "[Intro]\nSo you're the motherfucker they call Immortal Technique\nWhat the fuck make you so special, nigga?\nHuh?

Not against the forces of a colonial kingdom, but a rebellion against an oppressor that has risen among us\nIt is not a foreign invasion we have to fear, rather the threat of a force within our nation that has usurped what was once a dream of having the greatest democracy ever known to man\n\nWe now live in a world where the population has grown exponentially\nAnd the planet is running out of resources to sustain us all. We in the inner-city and those struggling in the suburban ghettos may not realize it yet, but make no mistake, the people who control the technology and run every enterprise that makes up our world have seen this coming for a long time. The ideas of renewable energy, global warming, the idea of collectively working were purposefully bought out, derailed, demonized, or corrupted in favor of an economic structure designed by a monetary caste system\n\nIn a desperate attempt to convince us that we need to maintain that extravagant existence, they\u2019ve pretended we might share in their dream\nThat we can justify any inhumanity in its name. Out of this blind ignorance was born the curse of slavery. Many of the founders of this nation were themselves Masons. That is not a Left wing or Right wing conspiracy theory. It is a widely known and accepted fact\n\nSo then explain to me how a nation founded by men who not only understood the long and complicated history of Europe, but also that of Africa could permeate such a lie in convincing the American public that one race of men was superior and one inferior. When, in fact, we know that all the early men the people who created civilization and every aspect of what we see today, the foundation of all modern human life, were from Africa\n\nThe greatest cowardice of course came not with slavery itself, unfortunately. But with the excuses for slavery. For if America had been as brave as the Roman Empire and all other empires that have come after her, and claimed \u201cNo, we were just stronger and that\u2019s why we took you,\u201d then when slavery was over, racism would\u2019ve probably followed in suit\n\nBut instead it was the social lie, the religious lie that was told that stayed in the minds of people that separated one human being from another. In order to distract us from the issues of class and freedom, they created issues around religion and race to dominate the world for centuries to come\n\nSome claim that they respect the culture of life in this country. They cry out for indignity of children that are slaughtered before they are born. But God has not penetrated their souls, for they have no empathy. Nothing in their cold hearts for the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken in our wars overseas, for that which they call \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d which are the burnt and damaged children of the world. They have no prayers for them. Only snide commentary on the internet and laughter in their hearts. And yet you claim to be one with God?\n\nWe talk about immigration in this country. Might doesn\u2019t make right, ladies and gentleman; it just makes right now. What we are saying to the rest of the world is, one day, when America grows weak, one day when her legions falter, on the day when her economy crumbles... China, Russia, Europe, whatever power has arisen... all you have to do is come here and conquer us in a few military excursions, and then you too can set up shop here, and in 100 years you can tell every red-blooded American, \u201cNo, you are an illegal human being. I am the true citizen. I have all the rights. You have no rights.\"\n\nMaybe you forgot how you got this country. Maybe you take for granted the blood, the sweat, the tears, that the people who live in practical serfdom shed everyday. For we may not run America, but we make America run\n\nWe talk about the Law, yet how many indignities have been legal in the past? How many treaties with Native American people have we broken? How many international laws have we violated? And, speaking of laws how can a corporation be regulated by a government that is funded and controlled by corporations? How can there be accountability for people who see a profit margin above the lives of Americans? Above the lives of human beings in other countries?\n\nWe have taken the soul out of ourselves and placed them inside machines\nMy words, of course, will be marginalized, demonized in typical fashion. Any time you dare to question the power structure they say you hate America. No, I love this country. I see its beauty every day in its people. And I love it a lot more than those who have abandoned the American worker that have chose to exploit and try to take away every single benefit she has, those that attempt to make excuses for every atrocity committed, in the name of supposed freedom. Those who demand accountability from everyone, but offer none themselves... who favor contracts over lives... Who favor invasion and control over organic democracy overseas\n\nThe greatest flaw that any intelligent person has is to think that they\u2019re smarter than everyone else. And so as the government has planted its spies amongst us, we have planted our spies among them. They have infiltrated every branch of the American government. They have retrieved names, data, hard numbers. The paper trail that will expose those that truly control this country, those that control the political parties, those that control the oil industry, the energy. Those that stand behind the companies faceless, whose names have never been revealed\n\nUntil tod..

For if ever there was the absence of Homeland Security, it is seen in the gritty roots of Hip-Hop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison.
