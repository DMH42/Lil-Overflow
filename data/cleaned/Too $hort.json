work for mine\nEight years on the mic and I'm not jokin'\nSir Too Short comin' straight from Oakland\nCalifornia, home of the rock\nEight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block\nShort Dog, I'm

house and pump that bass\nI'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place\nEverybody's got that same old dream\nTo have big money and fancy things\nDrive a brand new Benz, keep your bank right here\nNever

Joan\nShe loved the way I rocked on the microphone\nWhen I met Joan, I took her home\nShe was just like a doggy all on my bone\nI met another girl, her name was Ann\nAll she wanted was to freak with a man\nWhen I met Ann, I shook her hand\nWe ended up freakin' by a garbage can\nThe next young freak I met was Red\nI took her to the house and she gave me head\nShe likes to freak is all she said\nWe jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed\nThere's another girl, her name is Mary\nTalk about sex and the girl acts scary\nI heard she was freakin' from my homeboy Jerry\nTook her to the house and I popped that cherry\nYoung and tender, sweet Denise\nGet her in the bed and the girl's a beast\nI tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece\nShe'll only start talking about signing a lease\nI met this tender, her name was Lori\nAn X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story\nShe had a twin sister, her name was Lisa\nAnd just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser\nMy girlfriend's name was Michelle\nHer booty was bigger than a tail on a whale\nWhen I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well\nHer pussy got hotter than the flames in hell\nI G'd this girl, her name is Tammy\nI didn't wanna do it 'cause the bitch was flammy\nShe had a best friend, her name was Jane\nI pulled her to the side and I spit that game\nI met a lot of freaks in my lifespan\nFreaked one night with a girl named Pam\nThe very next day I saw her with her man\nOne week passed and I was in her again\nI had an old tender, her name's Janine\nShe was 32 and I was only eighteen\nShe likes to freak, she's just a fiend\nIt really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans\nI want a big freak, fat and sloppy\nI kick on back and I watch her mop me\nTwo tons of fun, big Mamma Jamma\nA country-girl from Alabama\nI met this freak, her name was Beth\nHer pussy got wet and it smelled like death\nI was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat\nBut I was all up in her trying to hold my breath\nBake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas\nShe said her name was Dinah\nShe was a built little freak from China\nI said I don't pimp or gigolo\nI'm having so much money that I don't need a hoe\nYou can break yourself but you can't break me\nYou never met a player like $hort, baby\nI knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo\nTook her to my house and we did it on the floor\nThe girl got freaky and I'll tell you more\nShe was down on her knees begging to blow\nShe's like another freak named Ren\u00e9e\nYou get her alone and she'll make your day\nLike Burger King, she knows the play\nBut a freak like Ren\u00e9e, you can have it your

like \"Female Funk\"\nSo when you see me coming or see me going\nI keep my money, let the hoes keep hoeing\nI once met a hooker, she did it for free\nOn the Foothill bus number forty-three\nAll the way in the back she was working me\nHad my big beatbox and I was jamming the beat\nI met this freak named Antoinette\nMacked on baby like an ice cold vet\nEverything she had is what I get\n'Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit\nI met another freak, her name was Rita\nBaby thought that Too $hort just might eat her\nI told her like this, she could suck my peter\nOr either go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her\nScratched her name out my telephone book\nNever again took a second look\n'Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon\nShe kept looking while I kept staring\nBaby came through with my homeboy Darren\nHer booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearing\nShe never left, he cut out\nI know you all know what I'm talking about\nThere's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner\nShe smokes that pipe and she's getting thinner\nShannon is cool but her mind is gone\nOne fat rock and it's going on\nShe had another buddy, came by my place\nThick ass bitch, said her name was Grace\nShe walked in the door working lace\nYou shoulda seen that look that was on my face\nShe's like this tender named Belinda\nThe homeboys called her 'Belinda the Blender'\nShe gave head like she made it up\nShe was twenty years old with a big round butt\nHad a girl looked like Olive Oyl\nHer father was rich and the girl was spoiled\nWhen she got mad, her blood would boil\nBut I wrapped her all up like aluminum foil\n\n[Chorus]\nThese are the tales, the freaky tales...\nThese are the tales that I tell so well...\nThese are the tales, the freaky tales...\nThese are the tales that I

Playboy $hort was ready to play\nI bumped into this girl, her name's Roshawn\nWe hit the motel and had it going on\nHoliday Inn to the break of dawn\nWhen I took baby home, I freaked her mom\nI knew this tender named Shari\nI took her to the house and let her freak on me\nBaby was a fan, she loved my beat\nBut I wouldn't raise my leg and let her kiss my feet\nI met this freak named

big fat titties\nAll night long she was acting shitty\nSo I macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti\nThere's another girl, her name is Rose\nI use to ride baby like brand new Vogues\nI never saw Rose wearing clothes\nShe's a Penthouse pet, ready to pose\nI was riding down the street when I met Janet\nHer booty was bigger than the whole damn planet\nAss everywhere, I just can't stand it\nTried to palm it but I could not manage\nI had this freak, her name was Bunny\nSaid I'm the only man who ever called her honey\nEverything I did to her was funny\nI macked on Bunny and I took her money\nEight,

handy\nI smooth got worked and it was so dandy\nI hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy\nHe did me a favor in return\nGave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne\nBaby got tossed, then I got on\nI grabbed the microphone and started singing my song\nMy young homeboy heard me rap\nAnd said he had way more freaks than that\nSo I told him like this, they might be freaking\nBut, boy, you never had

they at, where they at, where they at\n\nI sold tapes every day me and Freddy B\nBeen famous since 1983\nGive me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed\nA rap all about you called the special request\nOakland, you know I go way back\nTo Cougnuts, fast Stangs, and Cadillacs\nWhen homeboys put Vogues on any car\nWith 6 by 9's smoking burners\nEverybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat\nWhole town fucked around and started smoking D\nEvery rap I ever made was about this town\nI made 7 whole albums with no James Brown\nAnd even though I love his music, I just can't stand\nThe way they used it all up and didn't pay the man\nAnd after 2 platinum albums, you call me weak\nCause I don't sell records in the East\nNow what's funky, I say pussy on an old ho\nI guess y'all fools don't know\nWhy some good rappers can't sell no tapes\nIt's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake\nYou wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box\nWhile the young bitches ride on your jock\nYou can't do it like this homey, so just pass it\nAnd stop kissing them white folks' asses\nIt's like you smoked a whole damn key\nYou rap so fast you keep leaving the beat\nI'm from the old school, I love P-Funk\nBut now rap music is all that they want\nSo when I'm in my car, I play Clinton\nAnd when I'm on the stage I start pimping\nAnd when I hear your shit, I push eject\nThen I throw it out the window with the rejects\nAnd when the hard core rappers go soft\nI like to watch when they ass fall off\nCause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC\nAnd any other rappers ever talk about me\nI don't stop rapping, that's all they can say\nAnd how I dogg bitches, every day\nBut if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak\nYou be phony like a side show freak\nSome rappers try to come off positive\nWhere I'm from that just ain't how it is\nThey say rap music is here to stay\nBut the sucka MC's don't think that way\nIt took 8 long years before I got my break\nSo I wonder why rappers make fake ass tapes\nYou won't get paid like I did, so give up punk\nAnd while you're in the studio, I'm in the trunk\nYou got no choice, so don't flip that coin\nThis ain't the military, so you punks can't join\nIt ain't pop, it's called underground rap\nFrom Oakland California and the shit sounds phat\nI'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies\nThat's why they listen to the one and only\nI used to be broke, but now we all used to be\nGot no game for a bitch, all the game is for me\nAnd these bitches, can't say shit to me\nThey could never could fuck with Short baby\nI'm not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style\nDon't dress hip hop and dance real wild\nBut I do sell records like a motherfucker\nEven though you might I'm just another sucka\nI find the beat and then never switch\nGrab the microphone and then call you a bitch\nYou want rent money, I got pimp money\nOne thing's for sure, I won't give it to a ho\nI throw a bitch in the God damn trunk\nAnd start slamming that Oakland funk\nShort Dogg's in the house, once again\nTrying to fade the platinum, with Shorty the Pimp\nAnd when I do, I'm going straight to the bank\nWithdraw some money and buy some dank\nYou can't relate to my motherfucking homies\nThat's why they listen to the one and only\nI grew up on the funk called P\nBut these motherfuckers growing up on me\nAnd if I ego trip, and my head is fucked\nI take my ass back, to where I grew up\nAnd get real boy, it's never too late\nBefore I do like you and make a weak ass tape\nI'm in the trunk...\n\nIn the trunk, in, in the trunk\nIn the

and she's a bitch to the beat\nOf Too $hort, I said my name is Too $hort and it don't stop\nI love you bitches for the blowjobs\nI just laugh over and over\nWhen the bitch drinks sperm like it's a soda\nI straight start aiming, woops I missed\nGet back bitch, we'll never kiss\nI say she looks so good and she's so thick\nBut, man oh man, that bitch can lick\nIf I want it I could rock her\nBut I can't fuck no-head doctor\nBitches don't know that Too $hort's tip\nYou might get G'd if you don't suck dick\nBut I'm so fresh, I'm so down\nI tell you bitches the other way around\nIf you do me first, well I'll do you\nSo the game jumps off when the bitch is through\nSoon as I come all in her mouth\nI smooth get dressed and roll out\nI'm Too $hort, baby, fresh fresh again\nOne MC, one bitch broken\nI tell you, baby, playing just like that\nI'm the best of the greatest of the ice cold rap\nAnd, bitch, you're just a bitch\nYou work fast food and you think you're rich\nYou see, my game don't stop when it's on the one\nI love to see you when you work that tongue\nGetting real busy in the back of the car\nRolling down the Skyline Boulevard\nI said, \"Bitch, what are you smoking?\"\nA

jaw\nOpened my eye, guess what I saw\nBitches on my mind\nGrabbed the microphone then I started to rhyme\nWhat would life be if it wasn't Too $hort\nIt'd be nothing but rappers from the old New York\nBut that's not likely and there's no doubt\nBitches like me cause I'm turning it out\nI'm here, there, everywhere\nSporting fat rope, babies, I'm a mother fucking player\nRecognize game when

ain't nothing but a word to me\nI can check her, wreck her, or just get paid\nCut to the house and freak my maid\nYou see, you can't speak English but we don't talk\nCall her Lucy and she's juicy,

used to stand up and say \"Shoot it in my eye!\"\nI met another girl went to Spellman College\nEvery day after school I acquired the knowledge\nI took her to my house so I could get some\nI fucked her real good and made the bitch cum\nShe was hella limber, said her name was Amber\nShe wouldn't stop screaming, that's all I remember\nI had another freak, her name was Wendy\nWhen I first met the bitch

hometown pussy on the strimp\nLook out for a nigga, treat me like a pimp\nYou know I can't forget about the strippers\nCinderella with the glass slipper\nTop down in the Benz ain't spendin' no

Cleveland spit the good game\nThese hoes recognize when I come in the door\nI ain't trickin' bitch, so what you want me for?\nLike Natalie, swearin' up and down I had to be the one\nBitch lets have

our crew, we just play that shit\nLive, drums, bass, keys\nNiggas don't like it, you can get these\nStuck in the back of your throat\nFuckin with a pimp named Sir Too $hort\nWe coulda sampled the Luke but we didn't\nI'd rather treat ya like a ho and start pimpin\nWhen will you other brothers realise?\nCan't fuck with my crew better feel your eyes\nCos you must be blind if you can't see\nAnd I'mma say this shit quite frankly\nI give a fuck when freestylers step up\nI don't do it, tell you 'bout it on the next cut\nCos right now we gotta feel the flow\nAnd make sure we keep it real slow\nJust like the motherfuckin Dangerous Crew\nWe gettin funky like it's 1972\nStill puffin on them zags, dressed like pimps\nAnd ask The Ohio Players once again\nCan we sample the funk?\n\nY'know we don't wanna wear it out\nWe just wanna lil' piece, y'knowhati'msayin?\nWe ain't goin loopy, we're goin freaky\nWe gonna funk it track for track\nDangerous Crew style\nAnt Banks let me flip this one more

these\nKinda beats, so funky make your fingers pop\nIf you can't find a sample you ain't got\nNot one damn thing for a nigga to ride to\nBut I been gettin funky since I was in high school\nGrowin up in that Bootsy's rubber band\nIn '76, seen a mothership land\nNothin but funk all in your face\nI like to slow it way down in ass and bass\nCos that's how we be layin tracks\nJust flip the funky rhyme

friends\nBut he was almost broke when he flipped again\nSo he got on his grind, he wasn't wastin a day\nOpened up shop and started pumpin the weight\nHe thought about the boys that he could not pay\nSo he hustled by himself thinkin that's okay\nBut one night he was chillin with a freak named Carol\nHis door was kicked in and he was starin at a barrel\nThe brother with the gun saw him tweak on the base\nWalked right up and put the Uzi in his face\nHe said, \"Give up the dope if you still wanna breathe\nI tell you one time, you better listen to me\"\nAs my homie got robbed he lost the

wife\nYou had enough, you can't take this shit\nPut a end to all the meaningless relationships\nAnd find one that means everything\nI'm talkin' 'bout white dresses and wedding rings\nUsed to be strip clubs and the Bunny Room\nBut now you're in love on a honeymoon\nYou used to keep a extra chick\nJust for booty calls and sexy trips\nBut now you at the grocery sto'\nTarget, Wal-Mart, and Home Depot\nIf you break out of prison, and jump the wall\nYou couldn't even get a date, you wouldn't know who to call\nYou had a lot of women and you played 'em hard\nBut you retired now, give up that

in it\nAin't nothin' wrong with love\nEarly in the morning you just want a hug\nI've been there a million times\nAsk me how I'm doin', I'm feelin' fine\nBut really what I feel inside\nIs the need to have somethin' real in my life\nI had it before\nBut I'm like Cameo, I go \"Back and Forth\"\nLike Big Pun and Joe\nSometimes \"I don't wanna be a player no more\"\nAnd when the time comes around, you know what's next\nThrow away my phone and my Rolodex\nIt's gone, and I didn't even notice it\nMy player card expired and I'm stuck with my old bitch\n\n[Chorus: SNL]\nIf you don't wanna be a player no

fallin' in love is like hittin' crack\nOne hit and you a junkie\nAll day and night you'll be lickin' that monkey\nYou love the way it's sticky and funky\nYou said, \"I don't wanna live, if she don't want me\"\nI never had days like that\n'Cause I came up in Oakland, raised by macks\nI gotta get that scratch\nI get it from a batch, or from my raps\nIt's gon' happen, 'cause the game is here\nAsk Bishop Don Juan, I'm a famous player\nYou know when love'll happen for me?\nWhen I start buyin' hookers, and rappin' for free\nNever!\n\n[Chorus: SNL]\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no

vogues on any car\nWith 6 by 9's smoking burners\nEverybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat\nWhole town fucked around and started smoking d\nEvery rap I ever made was about this town\nI made 7 whole albums with no james brown\nAnd even though I love his music, I just can't stand\nThe way they used it all up and didn't pay the man\nAnd after 2 platnum albums, you call me weak\nCause I don't sell records in the east\nNow what's funky, I say pussy on an old hoe\nI guess y'all fools don't know\nWhy some good rappers can't sell no tapes\nIt's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake\nYou wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box\nWhile the young bitches ride on your jock\nYou can't do it like this homey, so just pass it\nAnd stop kissing them white folks asses\nIt's like you smoked a whole damn key\nYou rap so fast you keep leaving the beat\nI'm from the old school, I love p-funk\nBut now rap music is all that they want\nSo when I'm in my car, I play clinton\nAnd when I'm on the stage I start pimping\nAnd when I hear your shit, I push eject\nThen I throw it out the window with the rejects\nAnd when the hard core rappers go soft\nI like to watch when they ass fall off\nCause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka mc\nAnd any other rappers ever talk about me\nI don't stop rapping, that's all they can say\nAnd how I dogg bitches, every day\nBut if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak\nYou be phony like a side show freak\nSome rappers try to come off positive\nWhere I'm from that just ain't how it is\nThey say rap music is here to stay\nBut the sucka mc's don't think that way\nIt took 8 long years before I got my break\nSo I wonder why rapper's make fake ass tapes\nYou won't get paid like I did, so give up punk\nAnd while your in the studio, I'm in the trunk\nYou got no choice, so don't flip that coin\nThis ain't the military, so you punks can't join\nIt ain't pop, it's called underground rap\nFrom oakland california and the shit sounds phat\nI'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies\nThat's why they listen to the one and only\nI used to be broke, but now we all used to be\nGot no game for a bitch, all the game is for me\nAnd these bitches, can't say shit to me\nThey could never could fuck with short baby\nI'm not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style\nDon't dress hip hop and dance real wild\nBut I do sell records like a motherfucker\nEven though you might I'm just another sucka\nI find the beat and then never switch\nGrab the microphone and then call you a bitch\nYou want rent money, I got pimp money\nOne thing's for sure, I won't give it to a hoe\nI throw a bitch in the God damn trunk\nAnd start slamming that oakland funk\nShort dogg's in the house, once again\nTrying to fade the platnum, with shorty the pimp\nAnd when I do, I'm going straight to the bank\nWithdraw some money and buy some dank\nYou can't relate to my motherfucking homies\nThat's why they listen to the one and only\nI grew up on the funk called p\nBut these motherfuckers growing up on me\nAnd if I ego trip, and my head is fucked\nI take my ass back, to where I grew up\nAnd get real boy, it's never too late\nBefore I do like you
