What advice can you give me?\nGod: What advice can I give humanity?\nAtom: I suppose so\nGod: Live your life. Don\u2019t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you\u2019re not your salary. You\u2019re not your house. You\u2019re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else\u2019s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about.

his mother was racist, which is crazy\n'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have\nAll these black babies with black men but you racist\nLike bitch, that don\u2019t make no sense, but it is what it is\nYou know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger\nThe kids at school callin' him a cracker\nIdentifying as black, looking as white\nBeing told what you can or can\u2019t be\nThis kid went through everything\nHe went through...\nHe saw narcotics in the household\nViolence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped\nThere was crazy shit that happened to this kid\nAnd he persevered while the

he, he said fuck that, I\u2019ma persevere\nAnd that\u2019s why the message is always peace, love and positivity\nSee, he always saw things from two sides\nHe always saw things from two sides\nHe always knew that the message\nEverybody was born equal\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\nHe knew that because he saw that\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way)\nBecause he was stripped and torn down\nBy his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated\nAnd that did not know\nAnd he was stripped and he was torn down\nBy his white side that did not know\nThese people that are ignorant\nThat cannot see the bigger picture\nThat must fight and kill and murder each other\nBut once again, all he ever wanted to do\nWas spread a message of equality\nFor every man, woman, and child\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nNow imagine this child growing up\nAnd seeing the craziest shit\nBeing a part of the craziest shit\nRunning around with the wrong people\nRunning around with guns and knives\nAnd fighting and stealing and, and all this\nBecause he didn\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t know!\nBut he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn\u2019t right\nAnd he knew that he needed to get away from it\nNow I want you to also imagine,

nine hours of sleep\nBut spend four, five, six hours of that\nWorking on music, persevering\nGrabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror\nAnd pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people\nJust chanting his name\nHoping that it would happen\nBut the, but the, but the world said no!\nMothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no\nYa nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka\nNo-no!\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nAnd he said fuck that\nHe said peace, love, and positivity\nHe said equality for all

Star Wars\nWhen suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic\nAs my body began to fade\nIn this moment my mind was full of clarity\nBut my body insisted it was in danger\nI looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine\nBut I was convinced that something was wrong\nBefore I knew it I felt as though I was going to\nFall and fade away\nMy body grew weak\nAnd soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety\nI refused to believe this story\nI searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me\nI began to feel detached from reality\nI felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass\nI got blood work done\nAnalysis of my mind and body to no avail\nThe doctor said it was anxiety\nBut how could it be anxiety?\nHow could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?\nHow could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?\nDerealization\nThe sense of being out of one\u2019s body\nI\u2019m not here\nI\u2019m not me\nI\u2019m not real\nNothing is\nNothing but this feeling of panic\nNobody understands\nNobody knows the sufferings\nThis physical feeling\nIt can\u2019t be anxiety\nIt can\u2019t\nOr can it?\nCan it in fact be the mind controlling the body?\nYeah, of course\nI\u2019m so in control of my mind and my body\nBut I\u2019m subconsciously forcing myself into a state\nOf self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind\nI am unhappy\nNot with life\nBut with this feeling\nI am scared, I am human, I am a man\nBut I look in the mirror and I see a child\nI am an adult who recognize grown ups don\u2019t really know shit\nAnd they never did\nAnd it scares me\nCause now I\u2019m just a grown up who doesn\u2019t know shit\nBut one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me\nNo, no this feeling\nThis anxiety is nothing\nI have anxiety\nJust like you, the person I wrote this for\nAnd together we will overcome this feeling\nWe will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge\nThat we are alive\nAnd any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted\nWe will rejoice in this gift that is life\nWe will rejoice in this day that we have been given\nWe will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves\nStarting with mental health\nWe will accept ourselves as we are\nAnd we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror\nWe will accept ourselves\nAnd live with anxiety", "[Verse 1]\nI know that you think this song is

picked up the pen and then wrote\nWhile they was firing, you could hear sirens\nFrom people dialing and women crying in the phone\nI was in the zone, trying to make a living\nHeading to work in the morning\nEveryday felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased\nUntil I quit my job, then my work ethic increased\nElevated to levels I ain\u2019t ever seen\nStacking this cream, living the

corner, like the rest of the nation\nPassing bars back and forth like legal examinations\nAs a youngin I was running wild\nMe and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud\nDoing shit just to do it, \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t allowed\nI thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah\nNow when my mama was at home drinking, thinking \u2019bout the bills\nI was dreaming \u2019bout

after dark\n\u2018Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down\n\u2018Til we get older and hustle, now they try\u2019na gun us down\nWe just trying to make a living off of what

people act like they know you\nBut they can\u2019t even read you\nThe effort I put into music is still the same amount\n'Cause ain't a damn thing changed except the bank account\nI remember the day I

place to stay for a year\nPut food in my stomach, I had nothing to fear\nAnd once that 365 was up, I told him to quit his job\nAnd gave him a new career\nSo many rappers on that stupid superstar

the ego\nBut beautiful women ain\u2019t good for nothing\nExcept procrastinating\nI got a show in Paris coming up\nFollowed by London, I'ma tear it up\nSo many people just don\u2019t care enough\nAnalyzing faces in the crowd staring up\nWhat's the difference between me and them?\nHow come I ain\u2019t in the crowd at they show seeing them\nWhat that guy see in me that he ain\u2019t see in him?\n'Cause honestly I see no difference between me and him\nWe all people, all equal, we all the same?\nLookin' for control tryna play the game\nWe all got issues, just different magazines\nWe all sleep but have different dreams\nHowever, once you\u2019re awake and your life ain\u2019t what it seems\nAnd that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m living within my own dream\nHell yeah, fuck 'em all

at\n'Cause you know I brought em all\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for a problem then we can get it solved\nI just kill them with kindness, keep it peace and it dissolve\nYou got bitches, I got Bobby Soxer girls that be ride or die\nA shawty on another level, let me catch a vibe\nSuper bad girl, IQ is in the sky\nShe graduated cum laude, your bitch went to DeVry\nGod damn, oh girl, she a go getta\nAt the party takin' shots like a Beretta\nDoing anything and everything to feel better\nAnd now she in the crib getting high like a falsetto\nHow you feeling, I be yelling\n\"Why these motherfuckers grilling?\"\nAnd she give me life \u2018cause I\u2019m making a killing\nBring it down, do it slow, show me how that really go\nGirl I\u2019m new in town, I don\u2019t really know\nThey

radio\nTo be born free\u2005is\u2005to be born\u2005in debt\nTo live in freedom without\u2005fighting slavery\nTo profiteer\nI have met Southerners who expect and fear\u205fa\u205fNegro\u205finsurrection\nI see no\u205fpurpose in withholding\u205fthis from general discussion\nThere may be those within that outcast ten percent of the American people who someday will strike back at their oppressors\nBut to put down that mob, a mob would rise\nI'd like to ask, please: who will put down that mob?\nI'm an overpaid producer with pleasant reasons to rejoice, and I do\nIn the wholesome practicability of the profit system\nBut surely, my right to having more than enough is cancelled\nIf I don't use that more to help those who have less\nI owe the very profit I make to the people I make it from\nIf this is radicalism, it comes automatically to most of us in show business\nIt being generally agreed that any public man owes his position to the public\nThat's what I mean when I say I'm your obedient servant\nWe must, each day, earn what we own\nA healthy man owes to the sick all that he can do for them\nAn educated man owes to the ignorant all that he can do for them\nA free man owes to the world's slaves all that he can do for them\nAnd what is to be done is more, much more, than good works\nChristmas baskets, bonuses and tips, and bread and circuses\nThere is only one thing to be done with slaves\nFree them\nIf we can't die in behalf of progress, we can live for it\nProgress, we Americans take to mean, a fuller realization of democracy\nThe measure of progress, as we understand it, is the measure of equality enjoyed by all men\nWe can do something about that\nThe way our fighting brothers and sisters looked at it\nSome of them dead as I speak these words\nThe way they looked at it, we're lucky\nAnd they're right, we're lucky to be alive\nBut only if our lives make life itself worth dying for\nWe must be worthy of our luck or we are damned\nOur lives were spared, but this is merely the silliest of accidents\nUnless we put the gift of life to the hard employments of justice\nIf we waste that gift, we won't have anywhere to hide from the indignation of history\nI want to say this\nThe morality of the auction block is out of date\nThere is no room in the American century for Jim Crow\nTomorrow's democracy discriminates against discrimination\nIts charter won't include the freedom to end freedom\nRace hate isn't human nature, race hate is the abandonment of human nature\nBut this is true\nThere are alibis for the phenomenal excuses, economic and social\nBut the brutal fact is simply this\nWhere the racist lies acceptable, there is corruption\nThe race haters must be stopped, the lynchings must be stopped\nThe murders must be avenged\nI come in that boy's name and in the name of all, who, in this land of ours, have no voice of their own\nI come with a call for action\nThis is the time for it\nI call for action against the cause of riot\nIt won't surprise me if I'm accused in some quarters of inciting to riot\nWell, I'm very interested in riots, I'm very interested in avoiding them\nSo I call for action against the cause of riots\nLaw is the best action, the most decisive\nIt's in the people's power to see to it that what makes lynchings and starts wars is dealt with\nNot by well-wishers, but by policemen, and I mean good policemen\nOver several generations, maybe there'll be men who can't be weaned away from the fascist vices of race hate\nBut we should deny such men responsibility in public affairs\nExactly as we deny responsibility to the wretched victims of the drug habit\nThere are laws against peddling dope\nThere can be laws against peddling race hate\nBut every man has the right to his own opinion as an American boasts\nBut race hate is not an opinion, it's a phobia\nIt isn't a viewpoint, race hate is a disease\nIn a people's world, the incurable racist has no rights\nHe must be deprived of influence in a people's government\nHe must be segregated, as he himself would segregate the colored and semitic peoples\nAnything very big is very simple\nIf there's a big race question, there's a big answer to it\nAnd a big answer is simple, like the word \"no\"\nAmerica can write her name across this century, and so she will\nIf we, the people, brown and black and red\nRise now to the great occasion of our brotherhood\nIt will take courage\nIt calls for the doing of great deeds, which means the dreaming of great dreams\nGiving the world back to its inhabitants is too big a job for the merely practical\nNo one of us will live to see a blameless peace\nWe strive and pray and die for what will be here when we're gone\nOur children's children are the ancestors of a free people\nTo the generations: the fight is worth it\nAnd that just about means that my time is up\nWhen my time's up, I remain as always, obediently yours\nArjun Ivatury", "[Chorus: Logic]\nWe are, we are, we are, we are\nI\u2019m just tryna live my life\nI\u2019m just tryna do what\u2019s right\nI\u2019m just tryna gain insight\nI\u2019m not

I'm not sorry for making this album, and I made this album from a place in my heart of love... and I'm black and I'm proud as shit. That's the shit, that's the thing the whole world said I could never say or be or do. And I'm biracial and I love my fans. Swag. Flex. Rattpack\n\n[Everybody Interlude]\n\n[Logic]\nC'mon! Is it going? Alright, what's up guys, This is day one of recording for the, I mean *Claps* Hey, What's up guys. Make sure you keep that last part in there of me explaining it because we're real all the time. RattPack\nMy studio is being built\n\n[2nd Everybody Interlude]\n\n[Logic, Bobby Campbell, and 6ix In The Studio]\nLogic: *Tapping on glass*\nBobby Campbell: *Tapping his foot* \"What are you going to contribute?\"\n6ix: *Claps*\n\n[Justin Fleischer]\nThat was the first song ever created in this room\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, That's the first beat ever, damn\n(To 6ix): But like, what's it like from, going to what's going to be in here from Charles Hall?\n\n[6ix]\nOh, Nuts. It's gon- It's the come up. It's the glow up. It's what we've always wanted\n\n[Logic]\nUh, Well the message for the music is just equality of man. Straight up. Straight up and down. 6 o'clock. When white people find out that I'm black, racist white people. They treat me on some like-and I've heard this, \"Send your ass back to Africa, or at least the half that doesn't matter.\" Shit like that, that I've heard. It's like that's what I am, I'm either one or the other to these people. There's like just a handful, no more than I think like 4 songs, where I am truly discussing being biracial in America. With that being said, Those are the only times I discuss race, and it's my race. Not your race or his race or her race, It's just me being biracial and telling my story. And you might not like my story, but it's my story\nYou know, and then the entire rest of the album is rapped, you know, from different perspectives of a life that that dude Atom, who is being reincarnated has lived\n\n[Logic In The Studio With Groups Of People]\nThere's a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is Atom. Atom but like the \"first man\" right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And he's talking to this random guy. And the guy's like \"Life, What's it all about?\" And he's like \"What? What the fuck you talkin' about?\" He's like \"Where am I?\" Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I don't know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy\n\n[Logic On His Couch]\nI can't even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, that's like the most gangster feature of all time\n\n[Logic and Neil Recording]\nLogic: So what now, what advice can you give me?\nNeil: What advice can I give humanity?\n\n[Logic And Friends In The Studio]\nYou guys know Big Von? He's like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL\n\n[Steve Wyreman]\nOh Yeah\n\n[Logic]\nSo he plays this guy named Atom\n\n[Big Von and Logic Recording]\nBig Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit\n\n[Logic Explaining Concept]\nThis guy Atom dies and it's a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isn't until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time I'm rapping on the album pretty much, I'm rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So it's very sci-fi, but it's very real at the same time. It's weird man, it's a good one\n\n[No I.D.]\nHip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination\n\n[Logic In His House]\nI was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called \"The Egg.\" I read it and it inspired me so much, and it's essentially the same thing, it's just my take on it. You know, it's a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought \"wow,\" I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what it's like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So it's like wow, it's almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others.  They might view me as different people. I guess wow, that's crazy I never really thought of it like that\n\n[No I.D.]\nSo bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, That's the difficult thing to score\n\n[Logic]\nI didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. it's just crazy, but I don't know how the hell it came together, but it did\n\n[Hallelujah Interlude]\n\n[Logic Outside His House]\nThis is so much more than just music. It's like a true personal part of my life. So, I'm getting my license, I'm doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see\n\n[Logic Driving]\nSo yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, I'm like \"I'm fine, I'm fine\" I don't know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected\n\n[Fan Recognizes Logic]\nFan: Logic?\nLogic: 'Sup dude?\nFan: What's going on man, how's you day?\nLogic: Nice, I got an appointment. What's your name man?\nFan: Raymond\nLogic: *Shakes his hand* Nice to meet you Raymond\nRaymond: You have a great day\nLogic: Thanks brother\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, that's a big thing that I've been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people don't understand it and that's why I'm like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and it's hard and it sucks\n\n[Logic Making Beats]\n\n[Logic]\nIt's just so crazy because I've always-like I'm on my shit you know what I mean? Like I'm on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like \"you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But I'm gonna fuck you up.\" Like it's weird, it's crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. it's a mental thing that can affect you physically and that's why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, it's not that. It's my mind. It's anxiety\n\n[Making of Anziety]\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nWhen I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that\u2019s when you really-like I realized that he's got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when you're singing this for the first time\n\n[Logic]\nI think that's good, ah!\n\n[Rose]\nThe first time in my life I have done anything like that\n\n[Logic]\nYou never?\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nI'm not really sure how it goes\n\n[Lucy Rose Back Outside]\nNow listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i don't know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it\n\n[Logic and Lucy In The Booth]\n\n[Logic Recording \"Anziety\"]\n\n[Logic]\nYo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when I'm here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin' weird, but a lot of it goes away. It's like I have purpose with you guys\n\n[Logic Four Days Later]\nHold on, I'm trying to think... one sec'. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe that's not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... that's what I'll do, I will extend this verse...\n\n[Records Rest Of \"Anziety\"]\n\nIt's always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. It's gotta be the same\n\n[Records More Of \"Anziety\"]\n\nAlright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit\n\nI think this is harder than when I did \"Gang Related.\"\n\n[Continues]\n\nLet me hear that... Woo!\n\n[Logic to Bart Simpson figure]\nSo I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like I'm going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what you're doing. [Anziety bass boosted] You know what I'm saying? Gotta be really good\n\n[Bobby Campbell]\nI lost my job to Bart Simpson?\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, you're fucking out bro\n\n(Driving)\nI was with No I.D. yesterday, Haden't seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool\n\n[No I.D]\nWe shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. (Camera man: he's gonna edit that out) it doesn't matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0\n\n[Logic]\nJust out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it\n\n[No I.D.]\nMy thoughts were just by far his best work, for me\n\n[Logic]\nAnd I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah\n\n[No I.D.]\nI mean, I can- I can rap\n\n[Logic]\nNo I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, that's so unheard of\n\n[No I.D.]\nI haven't really recorded a song in 20 years\n\n[Logic]\nI texted J. Cole and I was like, \"Yo, Deon's rapping on my album, No I.D.,\" and he was like \"WHAT? How the fuck did you get him to do that?\" and I thought about it, and I just asked him. \"Only you could get him to do that\"\n\nI've waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon\n\n[Making of America]\nThe concept is how we're all and what's going on in the Native American community that's being ignored\n\n[America Interlude]\n\n[Logic]\nAmerica, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads\n\n[Production of America beat]\n\nWhen I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- That's why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because it's catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... that's the \"ohhhh \" and it goes off\n\nYou'll hear a switch up and then I'm just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and that's all he knows. And like, that's a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, you'll hear it\n\n[Big Lenbo in the booth]\n\n[Lenny]\nWhen Logic approached me with the contributing to the song \"America\" he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song\n\n[No I.D.]\nWe worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him \"hey, you don't really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.\"\n\n[Bobby Campbell]\nThe first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration\n\n[6ix]\nWhat's crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didn't have the string players, we didn't have the vocalists with us. That's what's so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I can't play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit\n\n[Lenbo]\nBig Von, he just gets really entertaining\n\n[Big Von recording skits]\n\n[Big Von]\nGot Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that.  Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories\n\n[Logic to Damian Lemar Hudson]\nSo I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre\n\n[Sam Spratt]\nSo, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and It's three in the morning, and I say \"Bob, what's up man, what the fuck is this?\" And he's like \"I'm in Paris man, I'm at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be.\"\n\n[Logic]\nEverybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and I'm looking at the Mona Lisa like \"Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy.\"\nBut then I'm looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, I'm in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like \"I'm gonna go look for something else\", not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this\n\nThis is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine\n\n[Sam Spratt]\nI'm like \"Dude, doesn't that have like a hundred people in it?\" and he's like \"Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I don't know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasn't it to be representative of Everybody.\"\n\nEarly into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through Google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but there's limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?\n\nI went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything I've loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover\n\n[Logic]\nThis is going to be my album cover\n\n[Sam Spratt]\nThe album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone else's shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly\n\n[Logic] For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against\n\nI didn't wanna be like \"I'm biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no I'm really gonna talk about not only what's on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who don't have the voice that I do\n\nI am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because he's amazing and awesome and he's a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, he's just been so awesome and he's just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover\n\n[Starr]\nThank you! This is dope, so dope\n\n[Logic]\nI appreciate it, Thank you\n\n[Patrick Starr in the booth]\n\n[Logic]\nI see good people who like to make good music and it's just that simple. Like \"Hey, do you like what I'm doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?\"\n\nSo I'm flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula\n\n[Paula McKeva]\nHiii, I'm Paula McKeva, all the was from [?], Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel\n\n[Logic]\nWe were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it\n\n[McKeva]\nI was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun\n\n[Logic]\nI was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun\n\nBut like she KILLED it. Her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit\n\n[McKeva]\nI told him to come on the stage and said \"Show me what you got.\" Then he went WILD and crazy. I didn't know who he was\n\n[Logic]\nAfter dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said \"yeah.\"\n\n[McKeva in the booth]\n\n[Kev Randolph playing around on the keys]\n\n[Bobby Campbell]\nKev, I love what you're doing, but we're gonna mute that sound\n\n[Killing Spree Interlude]\n\n[Booth Harmonizing]\n\n[Confess plays]\n\n[Logic crying]\nI just had this crazy cry because I'm happy though. And I'm not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, \"Anziety\" and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs  and my friends and music and fans. I can't believe it. Because I didn't have anything growing up, I didn't have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- I'm not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i can't believe it's all real and happening\n\n[1-800-273-8255 producing]\n\n[Khalid in the booth]\n\n[Logic] We're at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And I'm excited, I feel like I don't belong here\n\n(to the orchestra)\nI just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, I'm sorry, this is just crazy and I know we're here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality\n\n[Orchestra plays]\n\n[6ix]\nYo, Bob, you know what's really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FL Studio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. That's amazing, isn't that like crazy\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, we're just like Neanderthals\n\n(Laughing)\n\n[6ix]\nLike all the sheet music, but like what we sample\n\n[Orchestra plays]\n\n[Bobby Hall (Logic's dad)]\nMy name is Bobby \"Smokey\" Hall, I'm legend. I'm the legend of hip-hop go-go. I'm here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. He's just in his own zone. He's got a string session going on right now. [?] so yeah, I love him\n\n[Logic conducts the orchestra]\n\n[Logic]\nIt's been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it (Crying)\n\n[Bobby Hall]\nBobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what I'm saying? he had his own way that he lived\n\nI took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said \"That boy got bars.\"\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nYou were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like \"We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic.\" And I was like... excuse me? You were like \"You know what I'm saying,  we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what I'm saying?\" And I'm like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant\n\n[Logic]\nSo when did that click for you what that meant?\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nOh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like \"What does that mean when you fuck with someone?\" I thought if you're fucking with someone, you're fucking them up or something\n\n(Laughing)\n\n[Logic]\nThis is a classic documentary moment right here\n\n[Who?]\nLucy, I got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nSo yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, \"I wen't out with a couple of fuckboys\" and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?\n\n(Laughing)\n\nShe said that just means like a lame person\n\nWell, I fuck with Logic\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nI fuck with you all\n\n[Logic]\nWe fuck with you\n\n(Laughing)\n\n[Logic]\nIt was a long-ass time ago, I'm in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in\nAnd I'm like \"Dillon what's that?\" And he's like \"its that P1 bro, for sure.\"  And I'm like \"damn that's crazy, thats so cool\", he's like \"yeah man check it out\", doing all this shit and I'm like oh my god, I gotta have this\n\nSo i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and  got the kick for \"Like Woah\", and it's worth every penny\n\n[Sir Dylan and 6ix working on Ink Blot]\n\n[Logic]\nThis is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but it's all myself. And he's saying like \" I don't want to sleep all day and get up at night\" like eh's not happy with  the life that he's living because he's one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions\n\nIt's called \"Ink Blot\" because one of the line is \"I'm not me, I'm who you want me to be.\" And he's rapping like \"yeah I got this money and I'm not a real rapper it's all bullshit, I'm making my money, fuck it.\"\n\nLike that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, \"yeah yeah I rap\", but deep down he's not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. it's just a rapper who isn't happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So that's the song\n[Juciy J & Logic recording Ink Blot]\nPerpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man\nAll on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit\nKill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga\nKill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga\nAnd tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob\nThat\u2019s crazy!\nYo, I\u2019ma keep all this shit for the album\nOh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, \"Aw fuck\"\n\n[Logic]\nSo, we're here, on Scotch Wednesday, it's a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. (cheers)\n\n[Camera man to Logic]\nDid you smoke a Jefferey?\n\n[Logic (rubbing the wall)]\nFreefalllll\n\n[Logic]\nWoah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go\n\n(All hands on deck)\n\nKeep going\n\n[Jessica]\nYou're gonna do great. (Kiss) ... you just totally left me hanging\n\n[Logic]\nOh, sorry\n\n[Driving instructor]\nHello, sir, how are you doing today?\n\n[Logic]\nI'm doing good, how are you doing?\n\n[Instructor]\nYou brought the whole--\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, we brought the whole team\n\n[Driving Instructor]\nOh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?\n\n[Logic]\nI'm upset that I did what I'm supposed to do. That's the thing I'm telling you man. It's not like a fail. I've failed before, many times. It's just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it\n\n[Christian Martin]\nWe're at the DMV. Bob's taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, I'm a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things\n\n[Logic]\nThank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag\n\nGot that license though\n\n[Black Spiderman Piano interlude]\n\n[Logic]\n\"Black Spiderman\" I wrote, first and foremost, it's about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and I'm not\n\n[Logic in the booth]\n\n[Logic]\nLike, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is \"Peace, Love and Positivity\", and people HATE me. Like think about that... That's CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and that's so FUCKED up and I hate  that. People look at me and I go, \"I'm a rapper\", and they go \"What?\" or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look, or how i speak. \"Oh, you speak white\" or \"you talk white\", like the fuck? I've heard that my whole life I'm saying in general for this career. What do you mean \"talk white\"? What the fuck does that mean?\n\nI said fuck that, why can't Spiderman be black? Why can't James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And that's why I open it up with \"Black Jesus, Black Jesus\". And people are like \"What? Black Jesus? What the fuck?\" Like I've got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house\n\n[Booth Session]\n\n[Logic]\nI've known Damien for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And we've just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasn't shit, I wasn't nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And I'm sitting down there, and we're working, and I'm like \"I think I need some vocals on here\". And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows what's going to happen? You want to go in there, and let's see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping\n\n[Damian Lemar Hudson]\nAnd like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was\n\n[Logic]\nHe was like \"this is 6 years in the making that just came out\". And...\n\n[Damian]\nI don't know, something just hit me and I started letting loose\n\n[Damian in the booth]\n\n[Damian]\nSomething about that, some type of [?] grabbed me and let me soar vocally\n\n[Logic while listening]\nYES! Praise him! I'm putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW (to Damian). COME HERE!\n\n[Logic]\nYou just earned yourself a feature credit\n\n[Damian]\nIt was like one of those milestones in your career where you know you're just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up\n\n[Logic]\nI only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like  when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I can't do what they do. Like I'm Batman. I'm Player 1, I'm Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I don't work with Player 2s, I don't work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. You're a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when you're with me, you're under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture\n\n[C-Sick]\nWith Logic, time to go to the basement. It's my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project\n\n[Mos Definitely Interlude]\n\n[C-Sick]\nWhen i first met [?] I could see this [?]\n\n[Logic in the booth]\n\n[Killer Mike]\nI mean, he's a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, it's rich, it's moody, it revs you up and brings you down. It's an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, it's refreshing. You know? so, bravo! I've told him before, I think he's one of the best in the world\n\n[Logic]\nMannnn, come on. Thanks man\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nLogic's music makes me feel something. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me \" Why do you listen to my music? Like I don't understand\". \"Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music.\" but there's something about it I just can't explain, but it makes me really feel something\n\n[Logic]\nIt's kind of scary. I can't explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isn't a bad thing. That just means I have a good life\n\nIt makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it\nOoooo I just gave you some fire!\n\nWith my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like \"Yeah what's up!\" trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And  this time, I'm like fuck that shit. I'm not going nowhere, i'm not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks\n\nAnd I'm really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J. Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I don't need the public to accept me. I don't need anybody to tell me my music is great, or I'm amazing. Because I know I'm good, I know I'm great, and I know I'm amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know I'm good, and that's what this album is about. Knowing that you're beautiful, you're great, and you're special. Knowing that you are something, were something, and will be something\n\nSo fuck everybody else\n\n[Credits]", "[Intro]\nAlright\nIn the sky it's a bird, it's a plane, nah, who that?\nEverybody want me to save 'em, I can't do that\nGot a little shine and they wonder where the loot at\nThe life of an artist, I had to pursue that\n\n[Verse 1]\nSuperman all the time, yeah, true that\nThat's why I laugh, when they ask, \"Man, where the suit at?\"\nI love my family, love my friends\nBut when it comes down to money see it all depends\n'Cause now I got new family, I got new friends\nThat I never even seen before, where does it end?\nSee, I got loved ones and I got enemies\nBut at the end of the day, I don't know their identities\nAre they loving entities or people\nBefriending me for the fame?\nBreaking in the game, life'll never be the same\nIt'll never be the same, and they all like\n\n[Hook: Tabi Bonney]\nYou are my superhero\nI said it, I said it\nYou are my superhero\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was gone for a minute, came back in a flash\nSpit crack, up a dude's rock, like dash\nAny dame, know I got game, go ask\nThis is my true identity, no mask\nMost wish to get it and rub on a flask\nI wish to get it and rub on her a\u2014\nHip-Hop, what I'm talking 'bout, you ain't on\nAnd a metaphor, means I am hands on\nOut for the green, with a buzz, like Hornet\nI ain't rip the game yet, I just torn it\nSee?

I mean what if we got there and it's exactly as the data predicted: beautiful, lush\u2014then we destroy it just like we did Earth? There's only 5 million human beings left in the universe.

moved in with his father that he never grew up with\nBut we're not gon' get into that, like cocaine we gon' cut it\nHe loved music, but never had the time\n'Cause he was working two jobs and they both was overtime\nHis girlfriend always told him that he was destined to shine\nHe smiled, said \"really?\", but really paid it no mind\nAnd when he was of age the situation was shitty\nSo he packed up all his stuff and then he moved across the city\nRented a room from his homie's mom and dad\nThey saw the situation and they felt so bad\nThey let him live with 'em, and he was doing good\nWorking at the street fixing cars under their hood\nHe got up with his mentor, that he knew for a while\nHe met him back when he was a youngin', only a child\nA real good guy that gave him some equipment\nAnd then he sent him packing like a UPS shipment\nHe said \"lay some tracks, and maybe we can get it\"\nSo then he quit his job and he moved in with his sister\nThey lived together as children so yes he really missed her\nBut then he got another job, still working on music\nTryna find a style and figure out how to use it\nBut one day he got it, yes, he's so excited\nBut then he stopped\nSaid I got a way to go on top, they gon' find me\nSuch a long journey like I'm walking I-90\nThree thousand miles leaving the haters behind me\nAlong his path, he ran into a wise man\nSaid \"please tell me how I

write\nDusk 'till dawn, he be rappin' 'till the sun up\nCall him Super Mario he always get the one up\nFinally dropping tracks, now the mixtape is completed\nHis appetite for perfection was seriously needed\nThen it dropped\nHe would, sell it for twenty but his country in recession so\nTake it for ten homie consider it a blessing\nYes he a rookie, but you know they respect him\nThat Botox flow, so whenever he inject 'em\nThem haters tighten up their game but now it don't affect him\n'Cause if they step out of line yeah you know he finna check 'em\nHe grew up on the bottom, but dreamt about the

It's, first and foremost, another one produced by 6ix again, um, and it was just, it was something I wanted the world to know. You know, the duality of man, you know, uh... Being raised in a household full of drugs, guns, violence, um, just all that, but not letting it effect who you are, because on the first verse, I'm rapping from the perspective of little Bobby, me, who I am, just- you know, that little kid in that house and all the things that he witnessed and on the second- uh, on the second verse, I'm rapping from the perspective of my brother, someone who was in the streets and running around, and you know, maybe doing things that he shouldn't have done at the time\n\nSo for me, it was like showing you what can come from the same household. You can go left, or you can go right. I think a lot of people go that traditional route, when you're raised around- um, these things that can touch you. In a negative way, I think. For me I just saw it as a very positive, and decided to do my best not to go down the same route as a lot of my family members, unfortunately. Uh, so this is basically just the story of possibility. Uh, of what can come, and what can happen and my rendition, if you will, of stop the violence, you know, it's also sort of an homage to KRS-One as well, that's why I threw his vocals in there. Um, but yeah, I just wanted people to know what happens where I come from in Maryland, as beautiful as a place it is, its also a dark place, and I think that's everywhere you go in the world. Um, you know, me not going down that route that my brothers did, hence the title \"Gang Related,\" um, and yeah, that's it", "[Verse 1: Logic]\nLyrically I murder you quicker than Lamborghini drive-bys\nWho knew one man could handle more beef than five guys\nI\u2019m a motherfucking lyricist, bitches they fearin\u2019 this\nBack in the day they wasn\u2019t hearin\u2019 this, now I\u2019m the one who\u2019s steering this\nI\u2019m self-driven, will he kill it? \u2013 That\u2019s a lyrical given\nNew school style but the 90\u2019s is where my lyrics livin\u2019\nMy flow is like another Earth\nSecond nature I disintegrate ya\u2019, migrate ya\u2019, then lightsaber decapitate ya\u2019\nIn the beginning they said it was fabricated, as soon as the numbers escalated\nBut these fuckers just mad that I made it\nMore chains then when a slave trader, check it\nI\u2019m under MC\u2019s skin like muscle tissue, what\u2019s the issue?\nIf you talkin\u2019 shit then Im\u2019a hit you\nGrab a pistol then whip you, then dip you in lava, ain\u2019t no one \u2018liver\nSecond I arrive I murder it, no you never heard of it\nSo sick my lyrics I don\u2019t spit \u2013 I regurgitate em\u2019\nAs listeners chronologically study my words, verbatim\nAssassinate em\u2019, the second I raid em\u2019 like five-0\nWe pull off the heist and flee to Cabo now\nI mask emotions like a robbery, cause when it comes to matters of the heart\nWomen will clog your arteries\nRattpack, V\u2019s up \u2013 Visionary\n\n[Verse 2: Mikkey Halsted]\nSee the truth through the eyes of the childen that\u2019s born in poverty\nWhere their chances of breaking that cycle is like the lottery\nNot about black and white \u2013 you\u2019re rich or you\u2019re poor\nSo the poor trying to get rich till they stiff in the morgue\nI\u2019m the embodiment of \u2018real\u2019, I body niggers with skill\nIf I up it Ima\u2019 bust it, somebody bout\u2019 to get killed\nSmoke em\u2019 like Black and Milds, bringing lyrics back in style\nThese suckers don\u2019t want to battle, they ducking like Pacquiao\n8 blocks of bodies, I\u2019m ahead by a mile\nSucker thought he could rap, I fuck up nigga\u2019s morale\nI got the clarity of Jay, the complexity of Nas, Lines like Big L, I go against all odds\nLike Pac did, I pop shit with the best of them\nThey got to much estrogen to F\u2019 with him\nIma\u2019 changa like the nephilim\nI flood the market till there\u2019s no more left of them like the days of Noah\nI split the brick and dip my blade in coka\nTake a sniff and see there\u2019s nothing doper\nThis Coke-eighty shit, they soft as baby shit, pussy as chocha\nThey better deuce before the whole world smell the aroma\nListen, I want it all, Charlie I\u2019m born to ball\nIm the machine-gun preacher and this is my alter call...

But what I was saying in the original song, I was trying to talk about my experience at Lollapalooza. So when I was on my stage, a whole sea of people came through at Chicago and it was 50,000 people in the crowd, and I got a line that goes:\n\"Check the Instagram fam\nI got fifty-thousand people in the crowd, singin' out loud\nEvery word, that's every lyric\nYou can hate (shit), just stop actin' like you don't hear it\"And, for me, when I was in the booth, I trying to think of different cool ways to say \"fifty-thousand\", so I was like \"fifty-thousand people\" and I was like \"five-o-triple-o people done it\" and I was trying to flow, right? But I couldn't find it, so I just ended up going with \"I got fifty thousand people in the crowd\". But at the very end of the song, it said \"five-o-triple-o\" at the end and it sounded like a really cool tag, just like a dope kinda like production tag and so I left that on a couple of songs that I had, and it kinda made it on \"Flexicution\".

First and foremost because the original \"Growing Pains I & II\" were on mixtapes and before this album, I did, uh, the mixtape Welcome To Forever and there was no \"Growing Pains,\" uh, from any part of the series on that. So I think a lot of people thought that it may have been over and there wasn't going to be another one, and i wanted to give them that feeling of \"wow!\" like \"wow.\" \"Growing Pains III\" and all these people who heard these things on the mixtape like \"Man, he's still there. He's still Logic,\" like \"Wow.\" I'm a fan, I know what it's like, and you kind of dread like \"Ohh, what's that album gonna sound like?\" For me, I wanted to give them this\n\nIt opens up with a skit, and I love Wu-Tang Clan, so I always loved their skits, so it's basically about the first time I ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy. And then it opens up, \"Outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin', and the police they rushin', go to my head like concussion\" And I'm about fifteen years old at that time, and the gunshots, I still hear them every now and then throughout my life and I'm wondering, I always used to wonder \"What caused that shootout?\" Why did I hear his? What was it? So I kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was, in fact, a true event. So that goes in, when you first hear me rapping I'm laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind, from the eviction notice on my door, you know, just being on food stamps and welfare and not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow and just, all the wonders. And then the beat changes up and I actually fall asleep. So this is my inner-most subconscious thoughts that I didn't even realize at the time, at fifteen years old, but now, you know, at twenty-four and looking back, reminiscing, I know that those are the things that are on my mind, because growing up in that situation, no matter what, um, the only time I was special, the only time I was anybody was when I was asleep. When I was asleep I was a famous basketball player, baseball player, I was a rapper/artist, I was a singer, I was an actor, I was dancer, I was an astronaut, but when I woke up I was just a boy from a broken home, and that- that was very hard to swallow\n\nEven touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family, you know growing up on The Cosby's  and Family Matters, and you know, that was the closest thing I had to a real family. Once the television program turned off, or our electricity turned off, I snapped back to reality. Um, I didn't end it on a bright note, because there's people out there that feel that same way, so I wanted them to know that I'm with them. And I'm there, and I was there, and I understand, so...", "[Chorus]\nWaddup with you shawty, come and catch this vibe\nJump up in the whip, I'ma show you how to drive\nMet a lot of honeys, you the

this verse came about almost two years ago, when I wrote this record, the first half, I was- um, on tour, and I remember it being in the front of the tour bus and just looking at the open desert and just kind of writing this rap. Uh, Kebu from Atlanta originally did the first rendition of this song, um, with the sample that we later replayed, um, that's when I brought in DJ Khalil... and it was kind of just the fun, braggadocios-ness of hip-hop, yet really beginning to tell my story as well - Just in the flow, the cadence, kinda just showing off skill, um, but still telling that story and painting the picture of where the album conceptually was headed\n\nThen, on the second half, uh, that's where, you know you really get into, uh, just the mental state of a hungry emcee, you know, releasing his first album. So for me, um, this song is just damn near six minutes of hip hop, you know, the emcee - Who I am, and how I want to be perceived.... As an artist", "By the way\nI've missed you when I tried to say\nI had to fly away\nBut I'll be home for you some day\nBy the way\nI've missed you when I tried to say\nI had to fly away\nBut I'll be home for you some day", "[Intro: Tim Westwood]\nYo it's Tim Westwood TV\nGoing back in with my man Logic\nFrom the crib, to Capital Xtra\nLet's go fam!\n\n[Logic]\nAlright, oh man\nI'mma fuck this up, here we go\nCheck, ch-check, ch-check yeah, yeah, yeah\nOkay, now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice\nIt\u2019s me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cooking like chemists\nTake them back to way back when like Dennis, The Menace\nCausing mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice\nSmoking weed and getting higher than a flight attendant\nHip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant\nGot to pull it out for everyone that\u2019s in attendance\nOkay, back in the day as a College Park tenant\nStill can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t get a shorty pregnant\nMan, that\u2019s the definition of a life sentence\nA whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce\nCause I couldn\u2019t keep it in my briefs, man that\u2019s pathetic\nFuck all that back and forth, this ain\u2019t a game of tennis\nI'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate\nScared to go outside but I know I can\u2019t prevent it\nI'm, forever alone in my mind\nSee I\u2019m a self diagnosed hypochondriac\nEither at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at\nI swear that I got it, yes I got it over here\nBut I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here\nCheck it, s'over here check it, s'over here tougher, s'over here check it\nI said tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify\nTalib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by\nTwo words, Mos Def, in my headphones\nBlack on one side, now I'm in another zone\nSwitch flows, fuck 'em up\nPlay the game, run 'em up\nYeah I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck\nAll the people want is real\nGuess that's why Logic appeal\nHold up tell me how that feel, holdie to the\nRacism on television and in magazines\nPaying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn\nCountry don't give a fuck who I am\nJust a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand\nCheck it, yeah, so check it, so check it\nI gotta spit it, gotta rip it, I gotta keep it goin'\nI'm flowin' strictly off of the top of the dome, they knowin', can I get it?\nThe L-O-G-I-C I'm reppin' M-D\nI said it once I said it twince, I gotta check it yeah\nI know something is wrong\nI know something is wrong\nI know something is wrong\nI can tell in this song\nI'm feeling hella faded\nNo I never evade it\nThe second I get it I spit it, I rip it, I gotta do it yeah\nWe on and on, we on this Westwood\nFeelin' hella good\nJumped across the pond\nWord is born when I spit it\nLet this motherfucker drop the bomb\nShit is hella crazy, we out in London, where we come from\nThis is how we do it, get it done yeah and then some\nWhat you call me?

It's produced by Rob Knox and myself, and um, I had such a blast with him creating the song. Uh, you know, the classic break and just kind of doing my rendition of that break and putting that together and then, uhh, Rob just playing the keys and it rose over... it's just such an incredible vibe. You know? And-and, it's basically a tale of, um, my time around the world touring. Starting out in College Park, Maryland with all the homies back in the basement, um, uh hitting the road, you know what I'm saying? In a minivan, for the first time ever, in the freezing cold and going to Chicago and selling out my first show there... and different things like that until eventually going to Europe and riding the train and, uh, ended up in Belgium and Amsterdam and Switzerland and this and that and all these really beautiful places and I just wanted to talk about it. Talk about my fear of flying, which I'm getting over, all these, just, I wanted the people to hear the humility and the honesty and just like, you know...\n\nIt's weird, even now, recording this for Spotify and the listeners now, like, I-I love Spotify, I've been using Spo- this is where I find all my samples and to think that there's somebody out there, listening to me talk to them, and they want to know about my album; it's very surreal. That's what I believe encompasses, uh, the song, where at least with the song it encompasses, so um... Yeah, just about my travels; from A to B, here to there, and everywhere in between. It was originally going to be called \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\" but I went with \"Metropolis,\" the neo-city of the-of the world, if you will, it's definitely filled with my cinematic inspiration, uh, and you can hear it, so yeah, yeah, enjoy it", "[Intro: Logic]\nYeah!\nYou're trying to beat this game right now?\n\n[Verse: Logic]\nThis is level 10, it's level 10 y'all\nThis is level 10, it's level 10 y'all\nGotta use your logic, the force\nGotta use your logic, the force to get pass\nTo make it to the end\nMake it to the end, don't pretend\nCome on be my friend\nTell me how you're feeling the second I'll do it\nI've been dealing on that real ish\nI've been dealing on that real ish, uhh\nI'm the boss of all bosses\nNot one to floss but I need it\nThis is how we do it I gotta feel it, right now\nI can feel it from the whole style\n'Bout to kill this whole motherfucking shit freestyle\nUp the top of the dome\nSend them all home\nIf you can't beat this level that's word to the devil\nWhat you gonna do?\nI'm pullin' strings like Geppetto, can you feel me now?\n'Cause I wanna be a real boy\nCan you beat this level?

This is, you know, \"okay, we get it, the kid can rap, the kid can, you know, have fun, but let me hear him create something\" and that's what I wanted to do on \"I'm Gone.\" Funny enough, you know, 6ix produced damn near the majority of the entire album himself, and we were in the studio and we had just finished, um, I think it was, uh, the intro, I think that was one of the last ones that we did actually, and on the ride home he was like \"Man, I just want to get one more, I just wanna get one more\" and I was like \"Hey, if you can do it...\" And then the next day, you know, he made this beat and um, and I wrote to it and for me this is my inspiration. Me talking about my old inspiration. Of maybe just money and women and cars, the cliche hip-hop thing that I think a lot of people kind of get into hip hop for, just fun stuff, but- um, kind of getting rid of that and going \"I'm going to tell my story,\" finding the inspiration of wanting to just be myself, and let the world know who I am and just make.... music. So it sounds as though I'm talking about a woman, uh, getting rid of my own \"woman,\" and getting with my new \"woman\" - my new inspiration and leading into this album", "[Verse 1]\nWho's poppin?\nPolice in the streets\nLet's stop them\nTell me when the body count droppin'\nReal shit get\u2005to\u2005work no shoppin'\nBack\u2005in the east\nSeats in the beast\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's\u2005more for the fun\nHad to step away more for my\u205fson\nBeen\u205fa\u205fgood ride been\u205ffun but I'm\u205fdone\nWeight on my shoulder a ton\nI get it done\nI did it back to back to back to platinum plaque to plaque to plaque\nDon't give a fuck about that\nWhen I did it I knew I would do it\nWhen we school em you know we ain't truant\nI'm going", "[Verse 1: Logic]\nOkay\nIt's RattPack \u2019til my pulse flat, we keep it real, no false rap\nI got four\u2005cards\u2005and they all\u2005black, got four broads and they\u2005all that\nWe call that ballin', doin' this is my callin\u2019\nFlow\u205fis\u205fso\u205fappallin', my phone\u205foff and she\u205fcallin', I'm like, \"Yeah\nWhat it do?\" Penthouse, man, what a view\nFall back, 'cause I'm coming through with my whole team, they coming too\nThat's real, too real, motherfucker, tell me how you feel\nI'm too good for my own good, I won\u2019t leak the album, I\u2019ll let it spill\nNumber one, bitch, I bet it will, do the numbers I said it will\nI played the game and I'm still the same and I never changed just to get a deal\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nBitch, I\u2019m ballin'\nBallin', I came from nuttin' to somethin\u2019\nLike it's nuttin', yeah, you know I done it, now there's no discussion\nBitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama\nI'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas\nBitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals\nCatch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel\nWhen you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go\nIt ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know\n\n[Verse 2: Logic]\nI'ma live life 'til I overdose while they sleepin' on me, that's comatose\nI went mainstream with my main team, you just mad as fuck, you ain't come close\nAnd your next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl\nAll I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl\nBitch, I'm back again and I run it, always gotta keep it one-hunnid\nAll of y'all know y'all want it, turn it up and get blunted\nI'm like, \"Fuck the money, fuck the fame,\" I came here to fuck up the game\nGon' get it, I'm feelin' myself, fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself;

For me, I was always- I'm- I\u2019m just a huge fan of music. You know, I wear my heart on my sleeve, my inspirations on my sleeve, and one of them is Kanye West. And I always loved his song \"Addiction.\" You know, \"What's you addiction? Is it money? Is it cars? Is it [gibberish]? I got addict-\" You know, it's just like, I wanted to do something as well\n\nBut like I said, I grew up in a- in a pretty crazy household and I saw, you know, the use of narcotics and alcohol, and how it destroyed my family, so I-I never really went down that, so I-I never really had an addiction except cigarettes... And I thought, \"Well, that's kinda corny.\" Like, you know what I mean? Cigarettes is so frowned upon. How can I do it in a way where people can relate to it? And then I-I-I discovered the concept of Nikki, and taking it much more further than just this song: putting her all over the album. And if I talk about Nikki as if she is in fact a woman, then it would- it would- it would allude to that\n\nAnd um, but it's even before then. You know, I mean nine months before the album was even out, I would hashtag \"Who's Nikki?\" on Twitter, this or that. Who's Nikki? Who's Nikki? And everybody was wondering, everybody thinks, \"Is it his mom? Is it an ex-girlfriend? Is it it a this? Is it his sister? Is it-blah\" And everybody wants to know, everybody wants to know. Then you hear me on the record, on \"Bounce,\" \"In the whip, everyday wit\u2019 Nikki, she be ridin\u2019 wit' me.\" You know? Different things like that, and you\u2019re like, \"What? Who is this chick? Who is this chick?\"\n\nAnd then you get to the song, and I-I-I wrote it, as almost as if it was a break-up song. \"I love it when you're fresh. I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath.\" Like, uhh, matters of making love, or this or that. And when you finally get to the end and it's like \"nicotine,\" it's like that \"wow\" moment, you know? I remember watching SAW for the first time and realizing that the killer was in the room the entire time, and I was like, \"Oh my god!\" You know what I mean? So, that\u2019s what I wanted to create, and I think I did my best to create a song where it's not just nicotine. I could be heroin, it could be alcohol, it could be sex, it could be gambling, it could be whatever your thing is, um... Maybe it isn't even that bad, or maybe it's just a man or a woman that you're dealing with. Or... I-I wrote it so surface level that the listener can take it however they want, and then deep down, you would know what the song is about", "[Intro]\nYeah, yeah\nPower 106\nL.A.

I mean, it's still extremely conceptual. For me, it's like as many women as you get, as much money as you have, you know, weed you smoke, liquor you drink, whatever, whatever you're thing is it's never enough. We as human beings always want more, we are never satisfied, we are not complacent and it's much more than just partying or this-or-that, it's even along the lines of our profession. You know? Uh, in school, we want more, we want better grades, uh, in the workplace we want promotions, \"we want this, we want this\" so it's just never enough. And short and sweet, that's what that is and I got with DJ Dahi for this one, who is an incredible producer, and uh, we just had a great time in the studio.

hop. that's what I believe this song encompasses for me. for who I was to become and am now and am continuing to be every day. you know it starts off with the first half. that's the perspective of logic as a rapper and the industry. you know, \"work so much my greatest fear is Imma die alone.\" and then the second half is the perspective of bobby. just the regular dude the regular guy that I am that isn't affected by all this Hollywood bullshit or whatever the case may be. just the regular dude that's facing problems at home or with his family or trying to grow or you know, all these different things. that encompasses who I am. being under pressure not only as the man in the limelight I guess, but as just the regular Joe. so, for me, after I recorded this song, which was pretty much the first song I did for the album, I knew where I was gonna go, who I was gonna be, and how I would make people perceive me, give them the real and that's it. no way to twist it or flip it or

You know, it's not like I-I-I left anything out, I wanted to make sure that even in the fun, kind of partier records like this, um, there was still substance there.

This was awesome how this came together 'cause I'm a big Donald glover and childish Gambino fan. I think he knows that. it might be weird. Haha...um.

You know you're fans of and things like that and. When I created the record, I sampled spaz by N.E.R.D. and I reversed the sample and threw some crazy drums on it and just produced it out and I sent it to Gambino on some like \"homie,\" like \"yo, check this out. what do you think of this?\" just like in general and he actually hit me back and was like \"this is like really crazy\" and he kind of complemented it so much, I was like \"well if you really like it that much you know you can jump on it,\" and he did and I was like \"man that's so cool.\" Uh, so that's kind of how that came together and driving Ms. daisy is about I dunno I feel like the my success. I'm on the road to success and I'm so focused on the destination that I'm not enjoying the view along the way and Ms. daisy is like my accomplishments in the backseat and all the things I've done, but I'm not even talking to her. I'm just focused. I'm just driving and you know, I think it was time to pull over and enjoy the sunset or where the hell I am whatever view that was metaphorically.

I've wanted you to accept who I am. Just accept me and for so long you wouldn't,\" you know? It's not about me being black and white it's not about me this or being from here or doing that.
