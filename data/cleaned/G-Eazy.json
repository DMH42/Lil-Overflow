You know so much of hip-hop is a story of from nothing to something.\n\nI've never owned a car in my life, I don't know when I would drive it. I've never owned a house, I don't know what I would do with it. I'd never be in it. People see celebrity as mansion, car, white teeth, and fancy clothes. You know but what they don't see is severe anxiety and fear of falling, cause there's no safety net under me.\n\nThere was no plan B there was no trust fund or anything like that. It was like \"this has to work.\" Like have endless nights back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back killing yourself in the studio. Like the misery the pain. Does this mean anything? Is this trash? Like no one cares. You do not have an audience, no one cares about what you're making, it's all in your head. And I was just like determined, like it had to happen.\n\nThat's the thing about music is it's not like a 9 to 5 when you're done you go home. You have to run with it, you have to work your ass off and kill yourself to get any kind of results. I kill myself in the studio because I want to be great. You know, and I want to make something that matters to people. You have to project out into the universe what you want out of the world. You know, what do you want to be the best at? It didn't happen overnight, you know, so it's tough to look back and say like, \"well when did it happen?\" you know. \"When did your whole life change?\" I don't know, gradually over the last 5 years. So it's like, if I do want to have a house one day, if I do ever want to enjoy driving a car one day, it's not just gonna just fall in my lap, or maybe I don't know.", "[Intro]\nI'm so tired, I haven\u2019t slept a wink\nI'm so tired, my mind is on the\u2005blink\nI\u2005wonder should I\u2005get up and fix myself a\u2005drink\nNo, no, no\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm so tired, I don\u2019t know what to\u205fdo\nI'm\u205fso\u205ftired, my mind\u205fis set on\u205fyou\nI wonder should I call you but I know what you would do\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'd say I'm putting you on\nBut it's no joke, it's doing me harm\nYou know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain\nYou know it\u2019s three weeks, I\u2019m going insane\nYou know I'd give you everything I\u2019ve got\nFor a little peace of mind\n\nI'd give you everything I've got\nFor a little peace of mind\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm so tired, I\u2019m feeling so upset\nAlthough I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette\nAnd curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'd say I'm putting you on\nBut it's no joke, it's doing me harm\nYou know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain\nYou know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!\nYou know I'd give you everything I've got\nFor a little peace of mind\n\nHmmmm\n\nI'd give you everything I've got\nFor a little peace of mind\n\nHmmmm", "[Intro]\nYee!\nAy from the bay all the way out here overseas\nMan, across the pond\nLet's go\n\n[Freestyle]\nYeah, These Things Happen, you already know!\nYeah, Bay Area, looking like outsider with rolled sleeves\nBlack leather jackets cool Gypsies and cold thieves\nBreak brown cigarillos down and blow leaves\nYoung and up and coming still respected by OGs\nNow, oh ease, sorta like hip-hop's Tom Waits\nRappers sneak this and sound as nervous as proms dates\nBorn as a leader with strong traits\nJust trying to be legendary and right now I'm on pace\nYeah, uh grew this from the soil I swear\nThey don't make them like me bro, I told you I'm rare\nI'll stare at your girlfriend, I don't even care\nI'm a monster, I'm a beast!\nI'm a California bear!\nCatch me lurking in the shadows with a bottle of Bullet Rye\nChilling, leaned back, appreciating my fullest high\nYou can try, understand, you'll never be as cool as I\nCome in my arena, I advise, you shouldn't try\nRappers catch fatigue trying to run at my pace\nTry comparing us is dangerous, a stunting disgrace\nHit the titty bar with hundreds to waste\nI'm all over the place (BBC)\nHave you ever seen a rapper who looks like this\nEvil as a villain but they say my flow is the nicest\nRoll up then I light this\nMan, I'm hella righteous\nMight just, take a million for my name and likeness\nI feel like\nElvis in '56, the Beatles in '63\nYou got the male fans, the bitches belong to me\nI'll just looking at arenas, I know what I'm going to be\nThe power, the influence, the money I'm gonna see\nRapper, I am not you\nYour fake and I can spot you\nThink your on my level but it's not true\nMove to fast, I lost you\nTalking shit will cost you\nTheses Things Happen, out now, watch fool, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nYoung Gerald\nInternational\nYee!", "[Announcer]\nWe interrupt our regularly scheduled programing\nFor a Channel 3 special report\n\n[David -

a music video for an artist, and on this trip it hit me. Every rapper raps about money, but in reality 99.9 % of rappers never make a real dime off this music. So as I was thinking, I wrote this down in my iPhone and figured I would put it out as a blog\u2026enjoy\n\nThe Cold Truth About Success In Hip-Hop, The Pyramid Theory\n\nGroup A: The very top of the pyramid (.01 % of the entire pyramid)\n\nThis section represents the extremely few rappers that make enough money annually to be set for life. (Dre, Eminem, Jay-Z, Ludacris, 50 Cent, etc.)\n\nGroup B: The top of the pyramid (.09% of the entire pyramid)\n\nThis section represents the few rappers that make enough money in their careers to live a portion of their lives well off. These cats usually will have one good year where they might go gold, or have a really big single, but they never make enough money to be set for life. (Jim Jones, Flo Rida, Juelz, Lloyd Banks, Styles P, Obie Trice, just to name a few). Still, this is an incredibly prestigous group, and only represents .09% of the rap pyramid\n\nGroup C: The near top of the pyramid (.4 % of the entire pyramid)\n\nThis section represents all the rappers that are regional stars, and can tour and do shows in their region, but never really break out and become stars nationally. These rappers never end up making enough money to live lavishly, and will probably have to find regular jobs after their careers fade. (Mistah F.A.B., Raw Dizzy AKA Raw D.I., The Frontline, most of Thizz Ent.). Chances are there are a few in your city, and if you don\u2019t recognize the names I mentioned, then it proves my point exactly. These cats in this group are hardly recognized outside of their regions\n\nGroup D:  The rest of the pyramid (99.5 % of the entire pyramid)\n\nThis section represents everybody with 16 bars and a dream. Everybody with a rap group, a computer, a mic and ProTools. Chances likely you\u2019ve done a few shows, but nothing big. You probably have a mixtape or 2 out, but you don\u2019t have any distribution and you\u2019re not on iTunes. This group makes nearly no profit off of rap. That means they\u2019re broke\n\nWhat this all means, is that .5 % of all rappers take in 99.9 % of the industry\u2019s profits\n\nSo while the subject matter for nearly every rappers song is \u201cI get money\u201d, only .5 % of them are even making any money off of rap. And only .01% of them are REALLY  living like superstars\n\nSo this is my message to all you indy rappers, quit getting raped, step your game up! We\u2019re letting a few cats take all of the loot. We need to work harder in this game. There\u2019s a million rappers, but we\u2019re letting like 10 cats eat the whole pie\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand this idea, or if reading this blog doesn\u2019t motivate you then you\u2019re too dumb and don\u2019t belong in the rap game. This shits a warzone, its time to step your game up. Get right or get left. There\u2019s money to be made in this business, you just have to approach it in the right way\u2026 So ask yourself, which group do you want to be in? A, B, C or D??\n\nTo The Top\n\n\u2013 G-Eazy", "Sikkisclothing.com man\nG-Eazy, the Sikkis On The Planet Mixtape managed that\nHeat, straight heat, we droppin' that heat just to spring around\nIt's

a blog I posted a couple weeks ago, where I pointed out the cold truth in terms of where exactly money is being made in hip-hop\u2026 and how everybody n their grandmama seems to rap, but in reality only half a percent of them are actually seeing profits from music\u2026 If you haven\u2019t read it already go read it now\u2026 real talk\u2026 like now\u2026\n\nCool 4sho\u2026\n\nU finished reading yet?\n\nAiight\u2026 So if you just read that, and u still think you\u2019re trying to make it\u2026 then you\u2019re extremely optimistic or just doin it for the luv. Either way, first you should realize that the odds are extremely against you, and that if you even want to make it into the third section as a regional star you\u2019re going to have to have a few things going for u\u2026\n\nNumber 1 \u2013 Absolute, 100% dedication of your time and energy\n\n\u2013 You can\u2019t half ass this shit for a second, so if you\u2019re not about spending all your free time writing songs, workin in the lab, promoting, etc then it\u2019s not gonna work. If you\u2019d rather spend your time at the mall, at the movies, or playing madden then go find another line of work\n\nNumber 2 \u2013 Be humble and respectful\n\n\u2013 This is very important: rappers, stay off your own dick! It\u2019s important to have confidence but in order for anybody in this industry to wanna take a chance & fuck with you (managers, booking agents, graphic designers, etc) you\u2019re gonna have to be cool as fuck. Nobody wants to work for free with a pre-modonna who thinks that everybody should automatically cater to them because their that dope.  Fuck that. Nobody owes you shit in this world, and you\u2019re gonna need help, so be cool and act right and you\u2019ll get it\n\nNumber 3 \u2013 A full time producer and a studio on deck\n\u2013 Basically you need a situation where you can make as much music as possible at the lowest input price (without having to pay a grip for beats and lab time) because chances are you\u2019re going to have to make a LOT of music before you get a REAL hit. No matter how talented you are. Unless you have your own lab and make your own beats, this is also gonna take being cool and respectful, cuz some producer and some engineer is gonna have to give you free beats and lab time\n\nThe most important thing is be humble and respectful\u2026 Real talk\u2026 I\u2019ve produced/worked with at least 50 rappers in my career, and all of yall think you\u2019re the best at what u do. True a lot of yall are talented, but what\u2019s talent if everybody can string together punchlines and drop a hot 16? It takes more then that\n\nAlso when it comes to paying dues, don\u2019t ever get impatient. If you\u2019ve got a situation where you\u2019re comin up underneath somebody bigger than you, and you\u2019re getting frustrated cuz you want to be the star, shut that shit up. Take whats being given and make the most of it. Either that or go out on your own and make it happen for yourself\n\nIf you are gonna do it all yourself tho, do as much as you can on your own that way when checks start coming in you won't have to split them with a gang of folks. Try & make your own beats, your own graphics, heavy myspace promo, etc. It\u2019s gonna take mad time on a computer\u2026\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, to be successful in 09, U kinda have to be a computer nerd to an extent\u2026 The game is all digital now, all that sellin mixtapes and physical CDs is all but over with. The more you can promote your music online the better. if you don\u2019t have an online presence its a wrap. Selling mixtapes at the mall is getting you no where. Gaining an online fan base and selling your music on iTunes is the truth\n\nYo, so thats the game. Be smart & get on ya job if u wanna shine in 09\n\n1", "[Chorus: Kossisko]\nMoving out crazy\nAnd missing her calls, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI\u2019m trying to get the cue\nBut you\u2019re making it hard\nYou said you're running wild\nRunning wild\nRunning wild\nYou're running wild\nRunning wild\nRunning wild\n(?)\n\n[Verse 1: G-Eazy]\nYeah\nShe running wild these days\nGot in a fight the other night\nNow we ain\u2019t spoken in three days\nYou racing this time\nPlease to cover your friends happy days\nIt\u2019s almost like they see you with somebody\nYou used up and she stays\nIt\u2019s fucked up\nHop in on the Cadiblack\nHate the fact you wildning out\nAnd I\u2019m tripping trying to get you back\nAll of the sudden the tables turn\nTrying to keep this shit intact\nKnow you\u2019ll be the death of me\nI\u2019m saying \u201clook that\u2019s just a fact\u201d\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m in love with these Tumblr Girls\nWith skinny waists and drunk habits\nPretty faces, love status\nShe acts as if she\u2019s the baddes\nMan I swear she\u2019s just like tons of girls\n(?)\nYou just wanna live carefree\nYourself\u2019s wild and free\n\n[Chorus: Kossisko]\nMoving out crazy\nAnd missing her calls, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI\u2019m trying to get the cue\nBut you\u2019re making it hard\nYou said you're running wild\nRunning wild\nRunning wild\nYou're running wild\nRunning wild\nRunning wild\n(?)", "[Intro: Chris Brown & G-Eazy]\nWoah\nWhat you say?\nYou know who you are\nHaha\nOoh, yeah\nIt's a vibe\n(Hitmaka!)\n\n[Verse 1: G-Eazy]\nKnow you feel boxed in, let me get you out your mind frame\nNo, I'm serious, I ain't into playin' mind games\nWe could go rounds, I wanna eat it like a entr\u00e9e\nFavorite position, I be hittin' that all kinda ways\nYou throw it back, fifty stacks, I feel like Andre\nYou into zodiacs?
