Detroit, for a comedian\nI find them to be particularly challenging\nSo when I go there, in this particular story\nIt seemed like a pretty b\u0435nign night\nAnd I'm sittin' in the dressing room at the Fillmor\u0435\nAnd there's an older gentleman in there\nAnd I don't really talk to the guy much, but he was a nice guy\nCool energy, shit like that\nAnd then, uh, famed Detroit rapper Danny Brown came in\nNow at this time, I wasn't that familiar with Danny Brown's music\nYou know what I mean?\nSo when he asked me to smoke with him, I just smoked with him\nI didn't hear all that \"Adderall Admiral\" and all that shit\nI didn't know he was about that life (Haha)\nI'm assuming it's weed, I don't know what the fuck it was\nBut, boy, I mean, I smoked weed a million times in my life\nNever, ever remember feeling this way before\nAnd as I was walking on stage, I told my road manager\n\"You know, my number's up tonight\"\nHe's like, \"What does that mean?\"\n\"I'm going to bomb\"\nAnd true to my professional prescription, I did\nBut, there's bombing and then there's the shit that happens in Detroit\nIt's like, the crowd was with me\nBut the way the crowd responded to me widely\nWas one of my favorite crowd interactions ever\nAnd as the set is going terribly\nWhen it's clear I'm not gonna be able to pull the nose up and I'm gonna have to crash this thing\nI saw Danny Brown slipping out the room, which made me laugh really hard\nGo back in the dressing room and everyone, you know there's a stink on ya after you bomb\nWhere everyone looks at you like, you know what I mean?\nLike Headwound Harry, like, \"Nigga, are you okay?\"\nBut I really, I can't explain it to ya, I really didn't care\nAnd then, and then, it turns out\nThat this kind older gentleman was Big Sean's father\nAnd my goodness what the, the, he gave me a pep talk that only a dad could give\nAnd it made me feel wonderful, man (Wow)\nSo shoutout to you Big Sean, shout out to Detroit\nI'll never stop

of knowing that\nAnything you imagine that's for the good is possible to be a reality\nBecause a few weeks before I was discovered, I-\nI had a dream that I heard my music, my record on the radio\nI had nothing out, no one knew who I was, and, um\nAmazing, it really happened\nAnd so you know, it's just, it's...\nI- I- I can say to other young people as I said to my son Kailand\nI said, \"Listen,

great\nBetween great and the best\n\nFocusing could be the most self-fulfilling thing you could do for yourself because with focus comes accomplishment\nFocusing could bring out your greatest talents and give you true purpose in this world\nIt can take your natural ability and magnify it to extraordinary\nOne thing I learned and I'm sure most of us know is what you focus on\nWhat you put your energy into\nIs exactly what we should expect back\nThat's just the law of the universe\n\nKarma\nI seen it happen like 10,000 times\nIt is proven that 1+1 being two\n\nFocus is the key to being successful in any situation\nIf you focus on the wrong, you'll get the wrong things\nThere's no way to focus on one thing and expect something different\nHow you focus on something is giving attention to it\nEven if you don't like it and still focus on not liking it, you're still putting your attention to it and will still attract it\n\nFor example, if you focus on wanting a new car, you'll keep attracting the idea of wanting a new car\nBut it is easy to confuse that, because wanting a new car isn't the way to manifest it\nYou're simply just wanting a new car and not obtaining a new car\nRemember, the intent of your focus is so important\nThere's a difference between focusing on wanting a new car and focusing on a car being yours\nWe really should be clear on what we focus on\n\nHonestly, I feel like time is the most valuable thing we have ever been given and focus runs parallel to that\nBecause every second of the day we're focused on something, whether you realize it or not\nI for sure am a victim of focusing on the wrong things sometimes\nI spent a little too much time on my phone looking at comments, focusing on how it'd feel a little too long\nBut that's just human\n\nIt's very rare that you'd probably focus on 100% of your time on what you need to\nBut the biggest advantage is to quickly catch yourself and be able to reset your focus\nFor me, there's no way I could focus on something I don't love\nAt least not for long\n\nI'm just not content with my spending my life miserable and I just personally can't live like that\nIt is not a party of vibration you could tell how you feel\nYour inner guidance system\nYour feelings\nIf I feel good, I'm doing the right thing\nIf not then it's not what I'm supposed to be doing\n\nHow does what you focus on makes you feel?\nRemember, it's never too late or too early to know what makes you happy and to make that change by any means necessary\nI went into my last album focused\nI wanted to focus on making music that would change people's lives, help lift their moods up\nMusic that I felt that was undeniably great to me and talk about what directly affected me\nAnd that's what I did\nI never focused so much on executing these things while making music and what'd you know?\nMy first number one album and my most successful one yet\n\nYou can't measure success by anything but happiness\nI say that all the time\nAnd if you focus your energy on what makes you happy\nWhat do you think will happen?\nExactly\nIt always work out\n\nRewire any thoughts you had prior and know that you are what you focus on\n\nFocus", "[Intro]\nDoin' what I gotta do, doin\u2019 what I gotta do\nThis life is not for you\nUhh, woah woah woah woah\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhen\u00e9 Aiko]\nThat's just the ways, yeah\nI
