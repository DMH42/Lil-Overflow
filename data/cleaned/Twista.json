stones down on me\nI want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror\nAnd ask somebody to pray for you\nCause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand\n\nI was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers\nDrug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla\nIn the city of Chi the home of the G's\nIf ya dont work ya dont eat that's been the code of the streets\nAs for me I was brought up at an early age\nLearned how to cook cane started to gang bang\nAnd its a damn shame I chose game\nBut see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame\nAnd I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights\nAnd be wondering which nigga wanna take my life\nUntil then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters\n\n(chorus)\nI'm living the street life\nAnd I just can't get away\nI
