drawer\nBut thats not enough cause i want more\nSo much money on me you would think it growing on trees in my backyard\nI had to get it out of the concrete i feel the need to go that hard\nThey call me drip lord, leave sauce on the seat when i hop out the nascar\nBitch got a pitch for it she bad as hell tell your hoe keep her mask on\nIm getting green like a golf course hit a hole an one with my chains on\nIm getting green like a golf course hit a hole an one with my chains on\n\n{Lil Uzi Vert}\n(Courus)\nCan't come around don't trust you\nRan through the streets with the muffle\nNone of my niggas gonna tussle\nIf you want smoke we'll bust you\n100 racks stashed in the duffle\n100 racks stashed in the duffle\n100 racks stashed in the duffle\n100 racks stashed in the duffle\n\nCan't come
