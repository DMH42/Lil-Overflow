easy to get stretched out\nI was at the funeral when it all began\nYou know the painful transition from a boy to man\nLost sight of my mother at the age of nine\nDidn't understand death, nearly lost my mind\nBut see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it\nAge ten, new step family arrangement\nAt thirteen, started gettin' hair on my dick\nAnd noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit\nI would forever be hit with anything in reach\nThen my father would proceed to go to church and preach\nAbout forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked\nDidn't jump when he said then that ass got cracked\nPhysical contact was in form of a slap\nAt the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back\nCourtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap\nLeft the bitch on the ground with her
