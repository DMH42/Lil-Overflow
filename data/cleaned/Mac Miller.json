that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think \"what a cute guy,\" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...\n\nSo, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.", "[Intro]\nUh\nUh, uh\n\n[Verse 1]\nClose my eyes before I cross the street\nIf a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep (Uh-huh)\nWatchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep\nIt's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams\nI'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete\nI'm just an idea, nothin' con-cer-ete (Whoa)\nI came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines\nThey tryna change wit' us, but come to the same difference (Okay)\nShut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know\nMy voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl\nI don't mind those hatin' on my style\nI tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low\nI'm no God\nI don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd\nPeople sellin' drugs 'cause they can't find no job\nWonder if Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross\nLet bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons\nThe day that I die on will turn me to an icon\nSearch the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on\nThe best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan\nDylan, (Dylan)\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody do somethin'\n(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'\n(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'\n(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'\nYeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'\nYeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'\nYeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'\nYeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAh\u2014ah, ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\n(Whoa) Yeah\nIt ain't no party like aristocratic parties\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYah, yah, yah\nAh-huh, ah-huh\nSaid, it ain't no party like aristocratic parties\nYeah, yo\n\n[Verse 2]\nSippin' Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavorin'\nWhen I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it danglin' (Whoa)\nFlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton\nAsian women love me, I look like David Duchovny\nIn kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby\nIn case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me\nI ain't nobody, and neither are you (Nope)\nBeen contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn\nI'd rather write my own history book\nWhere the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look\nAll your songs are 16's and a hook\nWe here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution\nI'm dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it\nJewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity\nWonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup\nIf it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo\nI hear the fish bitin' nice right now\nI can't figure out life and feel right right now\nBoo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down\nSpit the shit that leave a diaper brown (Poo)\n\n[Outro]\nUh, yeah (Somebody do somethin',) somebody do somethin'\nYeah, yeah, yeah (Somebody do somethin')\n(Somebody do somethin') Uh, somebody do somethin'\n(Somebody do somethin') Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody do somethin'\nAnd... somebody move somethin'\nYeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'\nYou right there, somebody move somethin'\nUh, uh-huh, somebody move somethin'\n(Yo) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah (Yo, yo, yo)", "[Part I: Perfect Circle]\n\n[Intro: Mac Miller]\nOoh\u2014ooh\u2014ooh\u2014ooh\u2014ooh\nOoh\u2014ooh\u2014ooh\nYeah ([?])\nOoh\u2014ooh\u2014ooh\u2014ooh\u2014ooh\nOoh\u2014ooh (Fuck you) Yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Mac Miller]\nI came for whoever is in charge (Here)\nSuggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard (Here)\nThey need some coffee, everybody sleepin' on me\nGoin' round door-to-door, settin' off alarms (Beep, beep, beep)\nAll that horse shit, you shoulda left it at the barn\nKeep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah\nToo many whips, gotta get a new garage made (That's the ball game)\nI might steal one just to drive it in a car chase\nMe and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)\nI moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface\nHidden in a dark place, swimmin' in a shark tank\nGive a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in a arcade\n(Time crisis) Not a second to lose\nI'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth (Amen)\nAnd this is not another case of the celebrity blues\nThe devil wit' me and he tell me to shoot, boom\n\n[Chorus: Mac Miller]\nMurder, murder, murder, murder (Oh yeah), what would you do?\nHave you ever had to hurt her?

I'm finally driven to insanity\nBy my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me\nMy knees are shaken, see I'm not able to stand\nCuz they label a man by his paper in hand\nSittin in a dark alley with some paper and pens\nWritin, just thinkin when this day's gonna end\nWhat can you say to a man who can't look at himself\nWhen the image in the mirror keeps on yellin for help\n\nJust roll up\nJust

tryina get it written but I'm comin up with nothin\nA couple words in each line filled with somethin somethin somethins\nAnd to me, hip hop ain't got a criminal past\nIts just explosions of sound as these syllables clash\nBriain on critical mass\nFuck political trash\nThese politicians speakin, but its comin out they ass\nTalkin bout \"school is cool\" and \"drugs for thugs\"\nTryina push me down the path, but I shall not budge\nCuz, i've been thinkin and I think I have a hunch\nWho hand the mic to get enough\nWhile me and music makin love\nAnd my community, ain't all about who I choose to be\nThis life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities\nThis figurative language that I'm speakin so fluently\nLook back like a photo album seein who I used to be\nPlayin piano while I'm strummin guitar\nCan't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin to mars\nStare at death in the face, like I'm under a car\nAnd not everybody hatin, but enough for you all\n\nJust roll up\nJust roll

Mac Miller while being one of the most successful indie hip hop artists ever, lyrically he just didn't do it for me. He just kind of reminded me of everything I wasn't really feeling about mainstream hip hop these days. Then about a month or so before the release of his sophomore effort \u201cWatching Movies With the Sound Off\u201d he released a couple joints before that. My ears didn't really perk up to listen until I heard \u201cThe End Is Near\u201d first because Ab-Soul is on it, second Mac produced the joint and thirdly lyrically Mac Miller had stepped his game up. I wasn't entirely sold but I was intrigued. Next day the video for \u201cS.D.S\u201d came out produced by FlyLo. Mac Miller once again came correct. Lastly I saw the tracklisting and guest features on this album and I knew I had to cop it. Let's see if \u201cWMWTSO\u201d was enough to transform me into a fan\n\nAs I stated before I wasn't too keen on Mac Miller's catalog before this, however once this album starts it immediately grabbed my attention from the beat and the dark lyrics. \u201cThe Star Room\u201d is the first track on the album and it's filled with a Mac reflecting on his life and how it's changing. His new found success isn't all glory, glamour and fun times and it's evident this is causing him frustration. Everything from love, to drugs is covered in this song and it's a breathe of fresh air to hear from him\n\nA couple tracks later we get \u201cI Am Not Real\u201d which features Earl Sweatshirt (unfortunately only in the form of a hook) but the darkness continues on this joint. Like in \u201cThe Star Room\u201d Mac Miller talks about more specifically about the all the bad sides about the fame that he's garnered over the years. Gold diggers, fake friends considered acquaintances, pain, drugs and more. Hearing Mac take us into the other not so glamorous side of the music business. Mac is searching for answers to a lot of questions in this album in general and he's bringing us along for his journey through life\n\n\u201cI Am Who I Am (Killing Time)\u201d has Mac Miller questioning being famous but this also questioning God and religion. He feels like God has blessed by becoming famous however at the same time he wonders why God gave it to him if he's sinning. He questions those who judge him for buying material things with the money that he's making now. He feels that he almost wasting away in the studio because he spends so much time in there. The second verse takes an even darker turn with the content\n\nForfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away\nGrabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate\nDealing with death like you work in the morgue aborsving the souls\nForgotten, he lost his way\nStarring down that barrel, thinking not today\n\nNow I'll be honest the middle of the album kind of falls off a little bit for me because he seemingly goes back to the old Mac Miller that I wasn't a fan off. With songs like \u201cRed Dot Music\u201d (with Action Bronson), \u201cGees\u201d (with ScHoolboy Q) and \u201cWatching Movies\u201d old fans of Mac will be pleased to see that he is in original form here and I think that's a good thing for fans to see. There's definitely maturity on this album but he sticks to his roots too\n\n\u201cREMember\u201d is one of my favorite songs on the record where Mac Miller is paying homage to a fallen friend. The first verse has him talking to his friend wishing he would come back. A strong line has Mac wishing his friend had a kid so Mac could tell him/her stories about their would be father. The second first has Mac Miller telling people not to take life for granted because it can be taken from you at any moment so cherish it\n\nThe questioning of all of life's most difficult questions continues with \u201cAquarium\u201d. The first verse mostly is about religion and his wanting to search for a deeper purpose in his life than what he's managing now:\n\n\"I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago\nI like to toy with the idea that we really know\nIs what I do important in the grand scheme of things?\nIn my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings\u201d\n\nThe second verse is the continued questioning on life's purpose and even brings the idea that in America it almost seems like our purpose is to make money and gaining knowledge. Throughout the entire record we're witnessing a 21 year old man question the world around him from everything he's given, to everything he's earned over the years\n\n\u201cWMWTSO\u201d is easily Mac Miller's best effort. One part that I skipped on the album was its production which was extremely solid. One part that I see being overlooked is how well Larry Fisherman's (aka Mac Miller) beats were on this album. This album shows that he's really put in the work on the production side of his game. Even as a whole the guest producers on the album were solid and created a cohesive sounding album (the only beat I thought that didn't really fit in was \u201cS.D.S\u201d but even that doesn't matter because the beat was straight fire). Lyrically Mac Miller puts everything on the line, he's questioning a lot of things and dealing with a lot of pain too\n\nFor fans of Mac Miller you might not like the change his underwent as of late, but assuming that you're fans of anyone that's featured on the project you should enjoy what Mac Miller is offering with \u201cWMWTSO\u201d. All the features are on point and the diversity on this project whether it be production or lyrics is good to hear from him. I am officially a Mac Miller fan, \u201cBorn Sinner\u201d and \u201cYeezus\u201d may have come out on the same day but don't sleep on this album. What ever box you had Mac Miller in before this release I can guarantee you that he breaks that box wide open during this entire album", "[Chorus]\nShe's my divine love\nWe fly, these skies were made

up in Canada\nHad a little battle, spit our bars in the camera\nWe stayed up late makin' mixtapes\nThat we gave out tryin' to get our name out\nDoin' shows, no one knew us\nThey would boo us, knew that when we grew up\nThey'd be askin' for a verse I'm blowin' back Dutches\nStill got love for my dudes on rap mullet\nMan that grind was tough, we wasn't gettin' far\nStill rolled up to shows with more cars than people in attendance\nMost of the people, they were people we was friends with\nThe best shit but, it got expensive when we couldn't sell tickets\nWasn't doin' much but tryin' to be the illest\nAt your crib smokin' weed and raps\nGrindin' hard, 'cause music, we believed in that\nWe had some differences, yes, but for real we've been blessed\nYou the homie, man, I wish you the best\n\n[Hook: Samples, Mac Miller & Beedie]\nPaid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this\nKiss lips and spit the real\nI remember way, way back in the days\nEvery aspect is vivid (The Ill Spoken)\nPaid
