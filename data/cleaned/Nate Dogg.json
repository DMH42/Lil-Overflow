God that she don't come find me\nWhat was I thinking of, I should of never\nParked my car in front of the club damn\nRing the alarm\nYour woman has just been sighted\nRing the alarm\nHow'd she get in

ever seen, the way this gangsta leans\nTo come and swerve with me\nDon't let nobody worry me\nAll there's always be, in the back of my jeep\nThe night was filled with ecstasy\nI mean literally, but my weed has seeds\nDon't let nothin' worry me\nI know I'm interesting, it's that Hennesey\nAnd I give you a bit\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\n\n[Verse 3: Psyke]\nJust you're beautiful face alone\nIt's what I'm
