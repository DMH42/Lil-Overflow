(Where were you??)\nMy life is like a book that they\u2019ve been judging by a cover but have never took the time to fucking read the shit (Fuck!)\nI remember telling you my goals and my dreams but you didn\u2019t even answer so I guess you didn\u2019t believe in it\nI remember sitting with a gun to my head trying to ask you for some help but I guess you didn\u2019t believe in it!\nI don\u2019t want religion I need that spirituality\nI don\u2019t want a church I need people to call a family\nI don\u2019t wanna tell my sins to another sinner just because he\u2019s got a robe and he went to some academy\nI don't wanna read it in a book, I wanna hear it from you\nDon\u2019t wanna learn it in my school because they\u2019re hiding the truth (Swear..)\nDon\u2019t wanna talk about it to another fucking human being and that's only reason that I even stepped in this booth\n\n[Verse 3]\nDear God\nHow do I take this darkness and turn it into light?

fucking killin' me\nI made a name for myself by doing it differently\nI started writing poetry then I had an epiphany\nAnd instantly started meshin' words into a symphony\nAnd calculatin\u2019 patterns and delivering them brilliantly\nTo go into your mind so I could paint a vivid imagery\nAnd save you from the trash that you\u2019ve been listenin' to literally\nNah, this is not a game, this is not a test\nWhat\u2019s the point of rappin' if I ain't tryna be the fuckin' best\nDroppin\u2019 songs faster than a virgin when the pussy wet\nTo swim into the mainstream with the sharks so I can

live out the rest of my whole career\nI promise I'ma be one of the biggest in about a year\nI promise I'll be the one to convince you that thing fear\nIs a concoction by the devil to make the good disappear\nI promise I'll win a Grammy, I promise I'll win an Oscar\nI promise the rap game won't turn me into a monster\nAnd force the people who love me to treat me like I'm a sponsor\nAnd pray for my death for money and not for a life longer\nAnd that's facts (That's facts)\nManifested all this shit through rap (Through rap)\nSpoke my life into existence, I was workin' in the trenches\nSwear to

I'm taking home all of the bag\nGive me definitive and unlimited amounts of people loving me and\nCall upon everybody who came before me and tell them to come and inject me with whatever they're smoking man\nI'm sick!\nBut I think you know that already\nYou call me evil but how would you know it unless you live it already?\nYou think you\u2019re better right?\nCause nobody's seen what you\u2019ve done in the dark but if I put your life in this light you would crumble and fight to survive or die but bitch I fucking knew that already\nI ain't special\nBut I specialize in making you feel especially stupid for judging a human\nWhile you sit at home and the whole world can't watch what you're doing or follow and hate all your movements\nI ain't complaining but I know the people who do it are sicker than me and I'm sick enough I just might lose it\nYa, you think you know me 'cause you double tap on a picture\nI hate the fact that you judge me it\u2019s driving me crazy so when it\u2019s too deep I say fuck it and drown in some liquor\nI write these verses in blood I got chapters for days 'cause my heart is a biblical scripture\nAnd I ain't a prophet but I can predict that you\u2019ll never catch happiness till you're the pitcher\nSo please continue to laugh, if I\u2019m a clown you're a circus act\nWhen I rap it\u2019s in a surgeon's mask\nCause I place every syllable in a deliverable fashion from first to last\nThen cut back with a message that\u2019s hidden in melody making them think and ask\nIf I was the one on the table pushing, giving birth to rap\nMaybe it was me\nMaybe you like all my music but don\u2019t really actually love me\nMaybe you just want a picture\nMaybe you just want to see me 'cause you need some money\nMaybe you think that I\u2019m happy\nMaybe you think in reality liking my post is repairing a hole when it\u2019s actually shaking and cutting the soul right out of me\nI think I\u2019m sick\nI feel a rush of emotion whenever I post up a pic\nI got a problem\nI\u2019m in the studio rapping while this girl is sucking my dick\nShe cut a hole in my heart now I fill it with women who love me 'cause they think I\u2019m rich\nAnd if I be honest I just told a bitch that I care but I really do not give a shit\nSo what\u2019s your excuse?\nWhat helps you sleep?\nYou leave a negative comment not knowing what you sow you will reap\nI bet you smile when you post, thinking you're hurting me, but you see the way the brain works you become what you speak\nI need peace!\nBut y\u2019all can\u2019t offer that (you can't!)\nI held my ground, I didn\u2019t sell my soul\nI said fuck the fame, y\u2019all can take that offer back\nFuck a shelf you can't take me off the rack\nAll the fame is not worth the heart attack\nYou're insane, you're in pain, I can tell by what you're saying, but\nMy bad, I forgot you were fragile\nI forgot someone who doesn't even know me told you I'm an asshole\nI forgot that I\u2019m the villain\nI forgot that I\u2019ve always spread positivity, but you think I didn't\nI forgot that hatred stems from people who hate their own existence\nI forgot I\u2019m better off alone\nI forgot I care for everyone's happiness, but forget about my own\nI forgot I spend every waken second on my phone, *hahahaha*\nCome and join my circus, I\u2019m recruiting\nI\u2019m taking everyone who passes judgement bitch, that\u2019s including\nEveryone who thinks it\u2019s so amusing\nTo put me down while I\u2019m pursuing\nThe keyboard warriors that live online behind a screen that's just an illusion\nCome, come, come, come join my circus\nYou fucking pricks\nI\u2019ll fuck you till you love me then pay you to do some tricks\nI don\u2019t need a doctor I need a bag of nails and bricks to lay down on the floor so if you fail to land a flip you can feel what I felt when you tried to come sink my ship\nLet me explain, you all help me financially gain\nBut I spend my money on mental health books and read them just to control all my pain\nI don\u2019t wear clothes, but bought this chain and just like you this chain is fake\nI wear it to distract you from the blatant sadness written on my fucking face\nWhat'd you expect?\nDid you think I was immune to what you were saying and didn\u2019t see all of the disrespect?\nDo you think I\u2019m not human, have no feelings, or maybe you think I\u2019m fucking weak and now I\u2019m pleading\nMaybe you think I\u2019m just too good and that I\u2019m fucking cheating?\nOr maybe, just maybe\nYou're blind and the hate inside your heart clouds your eyes and your mind and your ears when I rhyme\nEven though we all know I\u2019m one of the best of all time\nOr maybe you're just a fucking bitch and I can't-\nStop comparing me to people who are not in my league\nStop saying I don\u2019t believe in God just because you can\u2019t read\nStop making fake profiles so you can spam my feed\nI'm not alone, I know there's millions out there just like me", "[Intro]\nI can't sleep\nI keep thinking about this\nWhat if, with everything that's going on, the world\u2005really\u2005is coming to\u2005an end?\nThen what?\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat if it isn't\u2005a lie? (What if?)\nWhat if we make it to heaven and don't get inside? (What if?)\nWhat if we get to the gates and see God on the other side and he looks us in our face and says our whole lives we've wasted time?\nWhat if we can't go back? (What if?)\nWhat if we can't redo this life and get one second chance?\nWhat if our future happiness is memories of our past (God)\nWhile we burn forever haunted by the devil's laughs? (Hahahaha)\nWhy?\nWhy do we push them away? (Why?)\nAnd why do the ones we work to keep never actually stay? (Why?)\nWhy do we focus on tomorrow and forget about today (Why?)\nAnd smile in everybody's face and try and act like we're okay?\nWhy do we live this way?\nWhy do we hate?\nWhy do we fight?\nWhy do we act like there's time and got more than one life?\nWhy? (Answer me)\nWhy? WHY!? Why? Why?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm older and looking for truth\nI'm holding my faith in my hand but the pain in this world has been shaking it loose\nI used to have so much to gain\nNow I have so much to lose\nThey say I'm crazy for looking for answers\nI say they crazy for not giving proof\nVision is blurred, I'm over concerned\nI'm looking at God to see if life with him is something I've earned\nThe devil's been watching he's tryna recruit he's been waiting at every turn\nI'm driving this life on the highway to hell but I won't burn, fuck!\nWe know the difference\nWe know what is wrong and we know what is right\nBut Satan is strong, God, and most of your people are losing the fight (We try)\nSo what if we fail?\nWhat if we can't escape his lies? (What if?)\nWhat if we can't change, what if he still controls our minds?\nWhere do we run?\nWhere do we go?\nWho do we talk to?\nWe look around and everyone we see is lost too (Fuck)\nWhat if life was just some test that we all do? (What if?)\nWhat if you were busy when we called you?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat if hell's on earth?\nWhat if being born is dying, and dying's birth?\nWould that mean life's not God's gift but the devil's curse?\nAnd to live was to be evil 'cause it's words reversed?\nWhat if the devil entered a pastor and he led a church?\nWhat if we looked for the truth, but didn't know where to search?

trying to master the beats\nThe roots is too deep, my black thoughts they're setting\nOn a quest for love like Illadelphia Legends\nI Kick, Push like Lupe, no skateboard\nHeating up like butane, you lukewarm\nKick shit like Liu Kang, you've been warned\nThere's two sides to everybody, I've been torn\nThe positive and the negative, hope I find peace\nThe middle ground is the balance, that's what I really need\nThey speak upon it daily but they never pay attention\nLearn a valuable lesson from being something that I'm not\nThat's closed off and cold with no contact (contact)\nI rose from the ground, but I bounce back (bounce back)\nI rose but I grew from the concrete with a crooked stem and pedals that don't sit right\nLiving life to the fullest\n'Cause it can end quicker than a blink of an eye\nAnd you reflect upon it all, then realize that you are wasting your time\nCan't get that back and that's frustrating\nDon't worry about it, it's all love baby\nYou can be anything you wanna be, believe\nNever fallin' for the fake shit I see\nIt's all sick like used needles and I.V's\nClear view like Visine, my mind been moving at a pace most can't keep up with\nPeace to the next, with all due respect\nI just vent upon these records 'bout things that I can't accept, lawd\n\n[Chorus: Dax]\nThis is all we got\nA dollar and a dream, this is all we bought\nTo pop, pop with the team

that you didn't notice\nI was focussed when you didn't focus\nI ain't married but I'm still a Joseph\nHad to part ways with my bitch cuz she cheated\nSo I pulled the Moses\nSeperated sanity from psychosis\nDiagnosis, heartbroken story of a dying poet\nTransgressions from my past agressions\nI learned a lesson and Imma add a lesson\nNot to trust a bitch or my dog if there was a difference (yeah uh)\nAnger inside, where it always resides\nCharlie Sloth let me cry on this mic\nDying to live or living to die?\nTwo questions that I ask myself before I fall asleep at night\nI'm an artist so my pain is a prosperity for others\nSo I'm forced to turn this darkness into people's light\nBut the weight is getting heavy and at this rate (uh)\nIt has me contemplating suicide\nSo it's a\nDifferent day, same book, different page, different people I don't even know they names\nIn a different city, on a different stage, rapping words that I used to write when I was underpaid\nYeah I'm getting old but I'm stuck in my old ways\nRunning from the cops\nGoing back to my old days\nTry to cut me off, back on my road rage\nThese people ain't loyal\nSo who am I trying to impress?\nHow can I love somebody else if I don't love myself\nHow can I sign if I'm trying to save lifes and all the label wants to do is take my shit and put it on that shelf\nWhy don't depression have an off switch?\nWhy can't I find a bitch to ball with?\nWhy everybody wanna talk shit?\nSmiled in my face, stabbed me in the back\nDo whatever it takes to put me in the coffin, and often\nI think about the consequences, are they real or are they comprehensive?\nWill I ever make it into heaven?\nWill my music turn into a weapon?\nWill I ever get an answer to a fucking question?\nWill I ever finish first to have to settle second?\nWill I ever be blessed or will I be the blessing?\nDo I have to sell my soul just to have a presence?\nIf I die right now will I be remembered?\nSo I take a sip, pop a perc\nWhy? because they help me work\nHaving conversations with the devil never ease the hurt\nHaving trouble calculating, finding what I'm really worth\nPost a pic, 50K likes if I don't got a shirt\nBitches in the DM, I don't see 'em unless they finna twerk\nBring 'em to the crib, dick 'em down, pussy in the hearse\nAll this fucking fame but it really feels like a curse\nI don't even know\nSo let me finish my diary off strong\nCouple minutes I hope it ain't too long\nOnly way I know to deal with the pain is to take it and disperse into songs\nMan I really fucking hope that I can write my raws\nMan I hope fire in the booth puts me on\nMan I feel so weak but this shit makes me strong\nIt's Dax\n\n[Intercourse]\n\n[Intro Round 2]\nThis is for everybody out there who has a dream

right in the face\nForcing me to calculate think bout every move I make\nThey could never take me I\u2019m a guardian of heavens gate\nNow I\u2019m here captivate\nMoving at a rapid pace\nNothing into something now it\u2019s Dax the one they can\u2019t erase\nSeperating fame from actuality I navigate while moving through a see pessimistic people that are fake\nImitate, innovate, educate, infiltrate\nSeparate, segregate, all just to accelerate\nA path that I was destined on to walk and I refuse to wait\nFor someone else to crown so I named myself the heavyweight champion\nIf I get knocked off I will be back again\nThose who didn\u2019t believe I closed my eyes and turned my back on them\nSpeaking mediocrity don\u2019t understand like Manderin\nSo if it ain't success man I ain't picking up or answering\nI'm the one who put myself here\nI\u2019m the one who told the devil fuck off it\u2019s only God I fear\nI\u2019m one who put the stars into alignment\nHad a Dream and then collided it with work and then I named it perfect timing\nI\u2019m the one that fell down, bounced back, relapsed, got lapped, reclassed but never fell off track\nFighting demons in the evening overnight while I was sleeping $7.25 an hour was the wage no cap\nI am definition I don\u2019t lack skill I lack recognition\nI don\u2019t have dreams I have premonitions\nEvery single word I spit is ammunition\nGassing on the competition\nNever break a sweat this shit is practice like an exhibition\nFuck permission I ain't never asking I don't need forgiveness\nThat is weakness\nOnly time I bow is when I'm meeting Jesus\nThat is genius\nSo what you gonna say\nWhat you gonna do\nHow are you gonna let a janitor nigga outperform you\nI came from the bottom and I swear I'm here to warn you\nNot everything I do is destiny cause I was born to\nSeek and disarm you\nEat in regards to every single rapper verse meet the straight partial\nOn the fucking mission that's comparable to Marshall\nIt's

shit, all while I was dreaming(whoo)\nNow, they asking why you change how you do that\nWasn't trying to stay the same, needed change and I knew that\nTo come up in the game with my name and this new rap(Dax)\nWould have to go insane, fight the pain so I proved that I\nI could go toe to toe with the best in the game, man that's word to Cole\nSit at a table share a plate, man that's word to Drake\nCuz I was chosen for this shit, man that's word to faith, man\n\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't tryna do wrong, just right(no)\nWhat's left I was handed, grabbed on, took flight(flight)\nSuccess I demanded,

was headed for the light at the end of the tunnel\nI was running through it all with my friends, I'm the only one who made it\nStarted basic, turned famous, now\nI show em how to write they book, take minds, rearrange and reword the hook\nCuz my words good as goals, so they play the crook\nLet em eat, I ain't hungry, how I played the crook, look\nI'm just tryna help you understand\nIt's strange how

slowly but everything\nElse in this world is temporary\nSo why does it even matter if I drink you anyway?\nEach and every day\n\nBecause when I drink you\nI mind you in moderation\nDepending on type, taste, brand\nAnd filtration, I feel so uplifted\nSo confident that the average driver\nI am suddenly turns into one\nSupernaturally gifted\n\nAnd that stop sign?\nYeah, I missed it\nBut I made it

me\nWell, atleast not to my face\nWho I really am is a little slow\nSo you help me speed up my pace\nYou know I need to stay in shape\nWhich is why you have me run your race\nSo we do intervals, all sprints\nYou set the tone, So all I have to do\nIs close my eyes and chase\n\nWell actually, I keep 'em open because\nI can't run you straight\nAnd you didn't lie, you just never\nTold me too much of you over time\nActually increases weight\nI'm not mad at you though\nIt's really not a big deal\nBecause my loss of self-esteem\nDue to weight gain feels in\nComparison to how good\nYou always make me

water\nSo I brought you home the other night\nAnd said some things I didn't mean\nTo my father\nHe told me he knows I don't mean it\nI just wish he would've also told me\nTo fast track my thoughts [?] my words\n[?] [seen it?]\n\nAlcohol, we're together all the time now\nI hope you don't think I'm getting too\nIndependent, I've got your back and\nYou've got mine, right?\nSo when the others say we need to\nSpend less time together\nI get defensive\n'Cause what they're sayin' is offensive\nTellin' me you're way too expensive\nCausin' me to be aggressive\nRendered me defenseless\nAre extremely deceptive\nAll reasons why they say I shouldn't\nBe apprehensive\n\nThey don't know you like I do though\nYou're the only one who can deal with me\nAnd I know you're down to ride with me\nBecause when you told me\nYou'd kill for me\nSo we fell in love\nAnd I never believed them when\nThey said you were a drug\n'Cause I don't think you're addictive\nPlus our relationship isn't built on lust\nIt's love, right?
