firecracker, quick is my fuse\nVendettas of death back; the colors I choose\nRed or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter\nSucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters\nThe gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nYou see they hit us then we hit them\nThen we hit them and they hit us, man\nIt's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'\nPeople don't even understand\nThey don't even know what they dealing with\nYou wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work\nBut people don't understand the size of this\nThis is no joke man, this is real\n\n[Verse 2: Ice-T]\nYou don't know me, fool\nYou disown me, cool\nI don't need your assistance, social persistence\nAny problem I got I just put my fist in\nMy life is violent but violent is life\nPeace is a dream, reality is a knife\nMy colors, my honor, my colors, my all\nWith my colors upon me one soldier stands tall\nTell me what have you left me, what have I got?\nLast night in cold blood my young brother got shot\nMy homeboy got jacked\nMy mother's on crack\nMy sister can't work cause her arms show tracks\nMadness insanity, live in profanity\nThen some punk claimin' they're understandin' me\nGive me a break, what world do you live in\nDeath is my set, guess my religion\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nYo my brother was a gang banger\nAnd all my homeboys bang\nI don't know why I do it man, I just do it\nI never had much of nothing man\nLook at you man, you've got everything going for yourself\nAnd I ain't got nothing man, I've got nothing\nI'm living in the ghetto man\nJust look at me man, look at me\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nMy pants are saggin', braided hair\nSuckas stare but I don't care\nMy game ain't knowledge, my game's fear\nI've no remorse so squares beware\nBut my true mission is just revenge\nYou ain't in my set, you ain't my friend\nWear the wrong color your life could end\nHomicide's my favorite binge\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nListen to me man\nNo matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang\nYou don't wanna be in it man\nYou're just gonna end up in a mix of dead friends and time in jail I\nKnow, if\nI had a chance like you\nI would never be in a gang man\nBut I didn't have a chance\nYou know I wish I did\n\n[Verse 4: Ice-T]\nI'll just walk like a giant, police defiant\nYou'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't\nMy gang's my family, it's all that I have\nI'm a star, on the walls is my autograph\nYou don't like it, so you know where you can go\nCause the streets are my stage and terror's my show\nPsycho-analyze tried diagnosin' me, why?\nIt wasn't your brother that brutally died\nBut it was mine, so let me define\nMy territory; don't cross the line\nDon't try to act crazy cause that shit don't faze me\nIf you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me\nCause my colors death\nThough we all want peace\nBut our war won't end\n'Till all wars cease\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nSee the wars of the street gangs will always get to me, man\nBut I don't wanna be down with this situation man\nBut I'm in here, if I had something better to do I think I'd do it But right now, I'm just down here boy\nI'm trying to get money cause I'm smart\nI'm gonna get paid while I'm out here\nI'm gonna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying\nIf I had a chance like you\nMaybe I would be in school\nBut I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving\nAnd I'm willing to die for my colors\n\n[Outro]\nYo, please stop cause I want y'all to live\nThis is Ice-T, peace", "[Verse 1]\n6 in the morning, police at my door\nFresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor\nOut my back window I make my escape\nDidn't even get a chance to grab my old school tape\nMad with no music, but happy 'cause free\nAnd the streets to a player is the place to be\nGot a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand\nGold on my neck, my pistols close at hand\nI'm a self-made monster of the city streets\nRemotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats\nBut just living in the city is a serious task\nDidn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\nWord\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeen my homeboys cooling way, way out\nTold 'em 'bout my morning cold bugged 'em out\nShot a little dice till my knees got sore\nKicked around some stories 'bout the night before\nPosse to the corner where the fly girls chill\nThrew action at some freaks until one bitch got ill\nShe started acting silly, simply would not quit\nCalled us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit\nAs we walked over to her, ho continued to speak\nSo we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street\nBut just living in the city is a serious task\nBitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\nWord\n\n[Verse 3]\nContinued clocking freaks with immense posterior\nRolling in a Blazer with a Louis interior\nSolid gold, the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw\nSean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell\nHad a beeper goin' off like a high school bell\nLooked in the mirror, what did we see?\nFucking blue lights: L.A.P.D\nPigs searched our car, their day was made\nFound an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade\nThrew me in the county high-power block\nNo freaks to see, no beats to rock\nDidn't want trouble but the shit must fly\nSquabbled with this sucker, shanked him in the eye\nBut just living in the county is a serious task\nNigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nBack on the streets after five and a deuce\nSeven years later, but still had the juice\nMy homeboy Hen Gee put me up the track\nTold me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack\nBruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough\nBe-Bop's a pimp, my old freak's a ho\nThe batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing\nLife has no meaning and money is king\nThen he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin\nHe said, \"Man, you out early, we thought you got ten\"\nOpened his safe, kicked me down with cold cash\nKnew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5]\nI bought a Benz with the money, the rest went on clothes\nWent to the strip, started pimping the hoes\nMy hair had grew long on my seven year stay\nAnd when I got it done, on my shoulders it lay\nHard from the joint, but fly to my heart\nI didn't want trouble, but the shit had to start\nOut with my crew, some punks got loud\nShotgun blasts echoed through the crowd\nSix punks hit, two punks died\nAll causalities was applied to their side\nHuman lives has to pass just for talking much trash\nWe didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 6]\nSwat-team leader yelled, \"Hit the floor\"\nReached in my pocket, pulled my .44\nDove across the room, peeped out the window\nTwenty cops jumped behind a Pinto\nOut the backdoor like some damn track stars\nBroke down an alley, jumped into a car\nSuckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind\nBlack wire touched red, the car was mine\nWe hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot\nHit the first turn, goddamn road block\nBroke through the block and we did it fast\nCops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 7]\nThe rollers gave chase at a serious speed\nOne more conviction was all I need\nThis shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di\n'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody\nAnd me and my crew, we were known to get ill\nWe carried heat for protection but not to kill\nWe bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun\nAnd all I was thinking was, murder one\nBust a move into an alley and did it right\nAnd me and my crew, we're gone into the night\nBroke to my old lady's who drew me a bath\nShe didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 8]\nWe made love like crazy on top of the sheets\nThis girlie was my worlie, a natural freak\nShe ran her tongue over each and every part of me\nThen she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV\nA technician with a mission, that's what she was\nIf there had been a crowd she would've got an applause\nThis girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done\nThen she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum\nThen she cold got stupid, pushed me on the floor\nHad me begging to stop as I was screaming for more\nAfter she waxed my body, she let me crash\nShe knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 9]\nUp the next morning, feeling good as hell\nSleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell\nHit the boulevard in my A.M.G\nHo's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T\nRing on my mobile, yes, cellular\nGot to have a phone when I'm in my car\nWas my homeboy Red, some say he's insane\nBroke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine\nTold me to meet him at the airport\nSaid he's jumping bail, said he just left court\nCaught the first thing smoking in a serious dash\nDidn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 10]\nFell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C\nCalled up my posse when I got there\nHit the Latin Quarter and Union Square\nRooftop devil's nest, the rest we passed\nBack-door'd the Palladium just for class\nAbout 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce\nWe never catch static 'cause my boys got juice\nDeuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads\nWhere a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead\nIt sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast\nBut it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask\n\n[Hook]", "Yeah, last year a lot of motherfuckers asked me\nWhy I didn't do no old sex nasty shit\nBut this year I went down to

son\nWhen I was twelve my pops died too\nWhat a brother was supposed to do?\nThey sent me out West\nTo live with my aunt\nI guess they though it was the best\nBut there was no love there\nGrowin' with no moms\nI guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum\nThe bedroom, the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom\nI didn't leave home much, didn't like L.A\nDidn't have no friends to trust\nGot bused to a school\nBlacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool\nBut in highschool I changed\nDidn't wanna bust, didn't wanna play the game\nI walked to Crenshaw High, shit was fly\nI hooked up with a new crew\nSome brothers that seemed like they knew what the fuck to do\nYou might call it \"gang\" but we called it a set\nAnd it was our own thang\nThe whole school was down\nAnd one way or another everybody fucked around\nWhether hardcore or not\nYou wore the right color or your ass got shot\nThat's how I'm livin'...\n\nI did three years in and made close friends\nHavin' no love my homies became my only\nI was glad: the family I never had\nBut I grew up fast, got a girl on 10th grade pregnant\nNeedin' cash, I had to change my style\nSwitched from bangin' to hustlin'\nNo more goin' buckwild\nHad to get a cashflow\nBut my hustle was weak, it was a no go\nI joined the army, four years in that shit\nBe all fucked you can be\nCame back to the hood\nMy homies had done good\nHad elevated their game\nAbout 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame\nPassed for the jewels\nBaby sledgehammers with the tools\nI speak on this with hesitation\nEven though it passed the statue of limitations...\n\nI checked the bank\nBought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank\nBut as I grew my whole crew fell through\nCops had us on the books as interstate crooks\nMurder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine\nYou robbed a nigga blind\nI had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose\nI was in tread with the pimpgame\nTook on the Ice name\nBut the pimp game moved too slow\nEspecially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough\nIn one night late I was in a carwreck\nAnd I was lucky to escape\nHospital for ten weeks, in bed almost dead\nAnd when I got well, I got caught in a cross\nAnd got locked in a jailcell\nThat's how I'm livin'...\n\nThey cut me loose\nAnd I had to change troops\nThis time they didn't catch me\nNext time they'll stretch me\nCause my time was gettin' short\nAll my homies was in court\nOr locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old\nSo I changed my life\nPut down the gun and picked up the mic\nIt took ten years to get from there to here\nBut I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run\nAnd they hate me more now\nThan they ever did before\nMy homies came back from pen\nAnd we all worked together\nTrue friends but every once and while\nSome punk mistakes me as a chump\nAnd he gets in my face\nWrong mothafuckin' place\nAnd I ain't lyin', that's how you dyin'...", "[Intro: Ice-T]\nSyndicate fool!!\nL.A. -- Home of the

gonna break down if they didn't jet soon\nSnuck across the hall and crashed in E's room\nBut then this freak came in, thought I was E\nStraddled her legs across me\nRipped off her blouse\nPushed her breast against my face\nStarted gyrating her waist\nSounds fly, like a hype sex thriller?\nBut see, she looked like Godzilla\nPushed her off me, homegirl hit the floor\nThis is what it's like on tour\nI hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick\n\"Could weez take ya picture real quick?\"\nJumped into a pose that I used a million times before\nTook pictures with the whole damn floor\nI couldn't say no, not to my fans\nYou see, they wouldn't understand\n\nCHORUS\n\nNow it's show time, \"time to flow\" time\n\"Evil lost the records but we still gotta go\" time\nThe house is packed, everybody's on their feet\nSo I say, \"Throw on Rakim's beat.\"\nE hits the fader and the crowd is lit\nI start bustin' off some new shit\nThe stage is so smokey that I almost fall off\nI start inhalin' it, I'm tryin' not to cough\nI'm catchin' problems from every angle\nThe mic cords are tangled\nI try to flow smooth but my words are mangled\nDamn near slipped and broke my ankle\nIf that ain't enough the police are hawkin'\nListenin' real close to the words I'm talkin'\nThey wanna put a brother like me in the back seat\nJust because I curse the beat\nThey wanna tap my phone, wanna keep my crib bugged\nCall all my homies felons and street thugs\nYou might say i think this lifestyle sucks?\nI wouldn't trade it for a million bucks\nAlthough it's all not glamour and gleam\nIt's still my dream\n\nCHORUS", "[Ice-T]\nCoolin in my crib, cold video dubbin\nFBI warning? Huh, don't mean nuttin\nThey call that shit a crime? Yo that shit's a joke\nHit record on my dope remote\nI heard my phone ringin, I wonder who could it be\nIt was the E, the V, yes the I-L E\nHe said, \"We got static - word, I just got out\nPunks tried to move at the club and we shot out\nBullets everywhere,\" Okay what's the prob?\n\"Ink got popped, he's dead as a doorknob.\"\nYou bullshittin! \"I ain't fuckin around\nThe posse's rollin tonight, nigga are you down?\"\nI grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac\nStrapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back\nI said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me\nSay you know where they are?\nHe said, \"I know where they be\"\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nTwelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight\nTwenty-five cars, under the streetlights\nSome people talked, while others cried\nInk was a brother, who shouldn't have died\nThen the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be?\n38 hard brothers stood and stared at me\nThere were only two words that I had to say\nP-A-Y, B-A-C-K\nThe car's loaded with a silence that could wake the dead\nPistols clipped as the chambers loaded full of lead\nEveryone in the crew knew what I said\nWould mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nThe cars at the corner like a long black snake\nNight prowlin' for a life to take\nYa see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye\nThat's the answer to the question why\nIn my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump\nFace of Death, then I cocked my pump\nI'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull\nJust layin for a reason to pull\nOn you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way\nI'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way\nBut then we spot him, Evil E shot him\nDead in the face, made sure that he got him\nOthers ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath\nAutomatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nThen all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye\nMy dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die\nI drank my blood as I fell like shit into the street\nMy corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat\nTen brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge\nCause whenever someone dies, nobody wins\nBut this drama, you'll never hear a word of\nCause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder\nGang murder", "(Make it funky)\nSo the people can get down to the funky sound\n'Cause my crew don't mess around\n(Make it funky)\nSo the girls can get busy, dog the dance floor\nMake the

slob\nLadies ain't looking for no brothers like this\nThey want the dub-twisting ballers with the ice on their wrist\nYou gotta get your cash right to get in the game\nMight have to pull a pistol, Flip some caine\nGet out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain\nTake your come up and reinvest to the game\n\"You gotta make the money first\"\nYou need a lot to go far\nWhat you think is rich, I just spent on a car\nWhat you think is paid, I just blew on a watch\nWhat you think is wealthy, I just dropped on a yacht\nFlip the street cash and try to pick some stocks\nKick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops\nBut it really ain't that easy, Or we all would be rich\nOne mistake, You're broke, The come up's a bitch\nMake the right moves and forget about sleep\nConcentrate on the paper chase, Join the elite\nFew dun got mad cash and money to spend\nMoney to straight blow and money to lend\nAnd only then, You made it past stage one, My friend\n\n[Chorus 2x]\n[Ice-T]\nNow you got the money and the cash flow thick\nBut you really ain't nothing but a richer trick\nJust because you're paid, you can still get thick\nBy your low life homies or skanless bitch\nYou gotta move it around, put it in the right hands\nMaybe a judge, Make a PA your friend\nUnderstand what really moves the world\nRecognize what really moves these girls\nJuice is more important than cash for real\nMoney you spend, But true power you feel\nIt ain't that easy to reach\nRespect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get\nMake your moves correct, Watch your crew\nWatch your back, They watching you\nAnybody round you has gotta be true\nOr you never make it past stage two\nListen, when you get the real true power, You know\nPeople will feel you, Wherever you go\nAnd when you really max this game\nYou'll never have to say your name\n\n[Chorus]\n[Ice-T]\nNow you got the power, It's on, My friend\nCuz the one thing women love is powerful men\nThe one thing women hate are

rock!\nLet your body rock!\nLet your body rock!\n\n[Verse 1: Ice-T]\nHip-hoppin' is the thing that's in\nIt's\u2005where\u2005the stone-cold nitro\u2005parties begin\nSo listen party people with\u2005the ear to the street\nThe college professors and the social elite\nTo the fly young guys and the pretty girls\nIce-T is gonna tell you 'bout that hip-hop world\n\n[Verse 2: Ice-T]\nHip-hoppin' is a way of life\nWith graffiti and rappin' on the mic\nAs the records scratch to the break of beat\nA-hip-hop is sounds of the street\nHip-hop has been around a while\nWith the serious funk, the disco style\nA record scratch, a simple rap\nA breaker spinnin' on his back\n\n[Chorus: Dave Storrs]\nBody Rock!\nBody Rock!\nBody Rock!\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nNow I don't care what people say\nHip-hop is here to stay\nWhen the hip-hop scene first gained attention\nThey said it would die\nThey said it couldn't make it\nThey said it it'd never fly\nNow everywhere for you to see\nIn movies, radio and TV\nBut the hip-hop scene has substance, unlimited dimensions\nAnd it will live with or without mass media attention\n'Cause it is not some fad created overnight\nIt is a cultural movement that's bred by city life\nNow I'ma break it down for all of you\nWho've never seen a hip-hop crew\nThe gangster cuts of cold DJs\nShockin' and rockin' 'til the break of day\nOr the master arts of the graffiti man\nExpressin' himself with his spray can\nYo people, what's it gonna be?\nHip-hop is makin' history\nNow a hip-hop club is not a disco\nIt's a record-cuttin', cold-crushin' rappin' show\nLike New York's Roxy, L.A.'s Radio\nThe DJs keep you at a peak and on the go\nNo three-piece suits allowed inside\nT-shirts, tennis shoes, loosely tied\nYou hear scratchin' turntables across the floor\nAnd DJs spin on two and sometimes four\nLike this...\n\n[Verse 4: Ice-T]\nSo when you listen to the music by your radio DJ\nAnd listen to the rappers on the records that they play\nAnd check out the graffiti that turns ghettos into art\nOr watch the kids who dance on the street and in the park\nWe hope it's time you realize hip-hoppin' is the way\nTo find true peace in city streets in this cold world today\nLet's dance, not fight, and all unite, just turn the box up loud\nTo the funky beat, on any street you'll find that hip-hop crowd\n\n[Outro: Dave Storrs]\nThe

I hate and I state is a fool MC\nYou wanna battle the Ice, you gotta be insane\nOne step toward my reppin', I inflict the pain\nGot so many raps, I got no place to store 'em\nGot so many damn pages, I

my work\nL.A. is my place, More Righteous is my base\nSo my lyrics make sense, no words I waste\nDown for a duel, colder than Kool\nChill with the brothers who built the old school\nRhyme like a rocket, smooths in the pocket\nProgram the 808 and just lock it\nCrash the studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two\nJam hits the stores, packed kinds of floors\nFreaks in my hotel
