graduate\nGraduate, congratulate\nHit them all and buy the place\nKeep the chopper by your waist\nAnd savers, yeah, they love to hate\nSo we must exterminate\nEvery hater, terminate\nHustlers, yeah, we earn the cake\nJacking like we masturbate\nNigga, I'll blast your face\nDuck it when the chopper says (Huh)\n\n[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]\nGetting money off that dope shit, dope shit\nEight to a seven,

that dope shit\nThat dope shit, everytime I flow spit\nMy dope shit\nNah, my dope is catastrophic when I rock it up\nFiends steady popping up\nNarcs steady watching us\nSo we got to shut it down\nPut the chickens in the coupe and move them to another town\nCall up my bottom bitch, my ride-or-die, bottom bitch\nOh yeah, she 'bout it bitch, trafficking a lot of bricks\nI'm like T.I., don't have to buy a lot of clips\nBitch ass niggas mad, love to talk a lot of shit\nWhen your money right, here come them haters\nThe more they hate ya, that's more paper\nMo' paper, bitches catching mo' vapors\nBack then we was on 'em, but let them hoes chase us\nI see they heart jumping out of they chest\nIf a trait, then the hollows jumping out of the tech\nThen that's case closed, we change clothes on every part\nWe so smart, getting caught is not our repertoire\nI'm still with it, yeah, I'm still with it\nDomain in the kitchen, I'll whip you up a meal, chicken\nDope shit\n\n[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]\nGetting money off that dope shit, dope shit\nEight to a seven, halfing that whole shit, whole shit\nOh, getting money off that dope shit, dope shit\nEight to a seven, halfing that whole
