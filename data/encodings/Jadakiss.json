Playstation memory cards\nAnd the industry wouldn't be nothing without me\nI don't know what it is, it's just something about me\nWhen Kiss come down, watch shit g\u0435t thicker\nI'ma still blow pound with some bitches and liquor\nAnd I know that f\u0435ds clicking the pictures\nSo I hit the garage, switch cars and come out in a pickup\nYou should see me I'm picking a chick up\nI don't slip up\nI bounce the X5 like I'm driving with the hickups\n[?]\nAnd he keep his block flooded like a movie release\nBut y'all go to the dealer when I go to the jeweller\nAnd I already got an R', 'bout to get a Franck Muller\nIce in a leather band\nDice in my better hand\n4-5-6 is the numbers I roll\nBefore I see [?] with my gun on the wall\nBack to the club, she can get the gat in the club\nDon't nobody act funny when I'm buying a bar\nYou ain't gotta have money still buy you a [?]scar\nYou know how we do, drink with a back to the wall\nOr I'm usually getting brains in the back of the store\nNow I'm drunk, two more drinks that's it\nYou could catch me on the dance floor doing that shit\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nIt's for my niggas in the clubs that's rollin' up\nFor my bitches in the clubs that's holdin' up\nWhere my niggas with my liquor, where my bitches in the club\nWhere my bitches with my liquor, my niggas in the club\nIt's for my niggas in the clubs that's rollin' up\nFor my bitches in the clubs that's holdin' up\nWhere my niggas with my liquor, where my bitches in the club\nWhere my bitches with my liquor, my niggas in the club\n\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\nKiss in your house, sit on a couch, with [?] in your mouth\nSorry ma', I ain't here for the drip on your blouse\nAnd I got enough dough to get all your things\nFront row, blowing dro at the all-star game\nI feel tension when I walk by, dudes be grilling me\n'cause the chicks that they be schemin' on, feeling me\nThat'd be the shit that'd be killing me\nYou boys act like, 'cause I rap, I ain't got the blue steel on me\nRoll up, hold up, get a drink first\nWould have been shot a lot of y'all but I think first\nWe could walk around the club, fronting with no shirt\nI don't care how big you are, that thing hurt\nIceberg over all, new wife beater\nAnd keep four broads so I push a five seater\nOnly two of them like to freak\nSo I make sure that I hit the other two twice a week\n[?]\nOne hand stays on a heater\nSo if you think about getting any ice, you better go in a freezer\nY'all know when the Kiss drops, what I'm going to do\nRoll up, Ryde or Die volume 2"}, {"song": "[Spoken: Jadakiss, Trainer,
