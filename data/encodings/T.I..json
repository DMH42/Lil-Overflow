I was at [?], I think [?]'s mall, [?] plaze or something. So me, Doe, Frank White. And Frank said to me \"alright, what we need to do to get out of Montgomery, Alabama.

I sat there and I said, \"so y'all really got something huh?\" From that day forward, I admire Doe because as a young man, the age that he was he always presented himself to be more mature. It\u2019s very rare that you find somebody at the age of 20, 21 and sit them down, in front of you know, someone I guess, they aspire to be like. And they are as composed, they're poised and posture like and looking, eye with this person, like you know, I got the same ability and the same talent, and the same potential to be on the level that you are right now. It's very rare that you find that somebody the age of 20, 21 and you could walk them into a room with a Nelly, or you could walk them into a room with a Timbaland or Jay Z, and they not lose their cool, they\u2019re composed, postured, with the morals, the standards, and the principles that were instilled in him from his family: his mom, his dad, grand-mama, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles. He walked like these people are watching him all the time. You know what I'm saying? Like he had people to answer to, so he can't carry himself nothing less than. Know what I'm saying?

All of them know that I tell them \u2018listen, your talent is only going to get you so far\u2019. It\u2019s the things that you learn, the things that you are able to do outside of the booth, is what's going to separate you from the rest. I said the same thing to Glen. He never left the studio\u2026 he said \u2018I\u2019d rather be here than the club, simply because I know this is going to pay off.' Remarks like that man, it was extremely rare to hear a man, at a young age, speak in that manner. Over here man, a lot of people look at us like a record company.
