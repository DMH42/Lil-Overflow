runnin the dash like JJ Stokes\nWhen the gun smoke, I quote another Murder He Wrote\nIt's thug emotions that I'm lettin off my chest\nTurn of the leader, tress and jess be the best like T.S\nI'm in

above ya heads\nNiggas be slumpin dead, so snappin they spines\nTryin to see what I fed, peep what I read in the eyes of my rival\nIt might surprise, but jealously sometimes is the only way for survival\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still a piece of shit\nStreet fires increased a bit, I might body a nigga for at least a nick\nQuipin the forty power, 24 hours of Armageddon\nThe fly terrorist, chapter of sporty cowards\nHoly sours, clense my sins thru repentence\nA center of attention when the name of my enemy is mentioned\nA nigga inchin, must be but stinkin how my squad run\nCuz I ain't
