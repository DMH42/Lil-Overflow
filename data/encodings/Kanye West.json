And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\n\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\n\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\n\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"", "[Saxophone Solo]\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"so what you think of this?\"]\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Mother: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Mother: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]", "...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]", "You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad", "[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\n\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\n\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise

I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men\u2019s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti\u2019s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity\nI designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I\u2019m \u201callowed\u201d to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas\u2026\nEarly 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don\u2019t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don\u2019t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn\u2019t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate\nI remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women\u2019s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don\u2019t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished \u201cCosby Show\u201d sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn\u2019t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike\u2019s in 4th grade\nBeing a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, \u201cyou should do a Jetsons tour!\u201d\nThis just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that\u2019s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas\nI appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy\u2019s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me \u201csmile Kanye\u201d, the world likes you again. \u201cRed or blue pill?\u201d\u2026aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn\u2019t have the prestige I have if it wasn\u2019t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that\nHmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again\u2026 Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim\u2026the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it\u2019s better to read than trained thoughts\nWhat good is fame and prestige if you can\u2019t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best\u2026create\nI have started a new company and I\u2019m so excited about the name\u2026it\u2019s got the best name ever\u2026of all companies\u2026of all time!!!\nThe name of the company is DONDA\nDONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers\nDONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs\u2026DONDA\nThis will all take time but I wanted everyone\u2019s to know what I really care about\u2026I care about people\u2026I care about my fans\u2026I care about people who have never heard of me\u2026There are over 7 billion people on the planet now\u2026It\u2019s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke\nThe Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be\u2026\nI\u2019m currently working on a new 7 screen experience\u2026", "This is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics\u2026It\u2019s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)\nWe would also like to design the MTV awards. We\u2019re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board\u2026don\u2019t just sit there\u2026reach out\nWe can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off\nWhen I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life\nSpike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!\nUNLESS YOU\u2019RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones\u2026why not promote it?\nAllow kids to use search engines to do test\u2026like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect\u2026please excuse my grammar\u2026I know it\u2019s extremely ironic\nSome kids have better memories than others\u2026what about emotional IQ\u2019s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?\nExcuse me\u2026I just get excited at the possibilities\u2026the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you\u2019ll see\u2026\nWe need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better\nWhen me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us\nThe adrenaline is running\u2026I don\u2019t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders\u2026I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven\u2019t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years\nI invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices\u2026etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products\u2026my strength is connectivity\u2026\nThere are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems\u2026we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments\nI just wanted to share what\u2019s been on my mind\u2026\n\u201cIf you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple\u2026but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.\u201d \u2013 George Bernard

Jeremy Scott's design.\n\nFirst of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I\u2019m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, \"Oh, you\u2019re not that bad after all.\" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?\n\nWould I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y\u2019all know y\u2019all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow, it\u2019s gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.\n\nThe, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn\u2019t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy\u2019s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... \"SexyBack\" album, and bro\u2026.Justin I ain\u2019t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, \"He deserve to win Album of the Year.\"\n\nAnd this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I\u2019m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!\n\nI still don\u2019t understand award shows, I don\u2019t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don\u2019t understand it bro. I don\u2019t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don\u2019t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more.

Bars\n\nSo it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us. In the way this whole albums put together. The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively. We didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in, anything. We just wanted to make the best product possible. And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people. What I said last night is like, we drop this shit June 18th. This ain't about waitin' until August and havin' some big this and that. It's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to, ride to, listen to while y'all workin' out and shit. Whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out. We gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over. Makin' shit for my core, my cut\n\nWith the creative director Matt Williams and Virgil Abloh, the whole team, Don C, Ibn, all the Been Trill family, and the combination of all the people we brought together from Daft Punk workin' like 3-4 joints on the album. The first joint \"Onsite\", \"I Am A God\", bless me, and Mike Dean. Travis Scott workin' on the album, Hudson Mohawke, Arca. And of course, at the end, last -- wait a second, am I forgettin' some people and shit?\n\nLast, but not last, that came and helped bring this whole shit together, the executive producer of this LP and the family, is Rick Rubin comin' in and finishing up the whole shit for us. Which is legendary because everything we did on this project, everything I get like when we release 'Numbers on the Boards\", from the video to the \"NO ARTWORK\" to the sound of the song and everything. I was like, \"What would Rick Rubin do? What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?\" Because I remember like Ricky would say, \"When we did Def Jam, we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct.\" Where we at right now? We in the middle of the city right now, over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music and yall vibin out to this shit..

I ain\u2019t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon\u2019 win over and over and over and then you wake up, you still can\u2019t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!\n\nMark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now?! Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?! Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn\u2019t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn\u2019t! Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro! The vibes is back!\n\n[to DJ] Aye, John, take it all the way back to the beginning.\n\nShia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.\n\nQ-Tip, I love you, bro. Don\u2019t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don\u2019t tell me how to be me, though. I\u2019ve been me, I am me. There\u2019s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That\u2019s happened with musicians because they\u2019re scared. I\u2019m not scared! I\u2019m here to change things! I am here to change things. And things won\u2019t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been blessed with. My vision! I\u2019m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I\u2019m going to say how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready!

I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.' He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I don't know if y'all have heard of [Nikola] Tesla, and I'm not talking about the car, I'm talking about the inventor. Or if y'all ever heard about [Alejandro] Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 'creative genius,' I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who [says], 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now.

I want y'all to know, every time I go to the studio, every time I do an interview, every time I make a motherfuckin' t-shirt, the thing I do, I give it everything I got. And when I talk that shit, it's so that you can talk that shit. If you a fan of me, you a fan of your motherfuckin' self. You can do something that'll change the world. Look at how they try to make me look. They try to make me look crazy. And the people that write that? I don't see them performing for 90,000 motherfuckers \u2026 I know you seen movies and shit.

Why they so scared of me? \u2026 Little ol' me?' Because I want peoples' minds to finally be free. What's the new cool? What's the new cool? Can you tell me what's the new cool?

This is only the beginning \u2026 Because in all honesty, I'm not gonna lie to y'all right now, this might not come off as humble, but I'm gonna tell y'all the truth. I ain't concerned about nobody that's actually living. I know people get mad at me when I compare myself, but that's the only way I can explain what my aspirations are. When I'm talkin' 'bout Walt Disney, when I'm talkin' 'bout Howard Hughes, when I'm talkin' 'bout Henry Ford, when I'm talkin' 'bout Beethoven, when I talk about Mozart, when I talk about Shakespeare, and they all had their time on this earth. And I'm only 37. And right now I'm rockin' to 90,000, of y'all motherfuckers right now. So I ain't goin' at anybody on the radio. I'm goin' after Shakespeare. I'm goin' after Walt Disney. I'm going after Howard Hughes. I'm going after David Stern. I'm goin' after Henry Ford. I'm going after Elon Musk. Okay, he is living, but he's my boy. Whether you believe it or not \u2026 you can only achieve as high as you believe. You can only achieve as high as you believe \u2026 And just like Martin had a dream, and just like Kendrick had a dream. I believe in everything. I believe in anything. You can only believe \u2026 I can only stand here when I been fucked up so many times. Fucked up so many times \u2026 And I know that I ain't perfect. But everything I'm not makes me everything I am.\n\nI came to Bonnaroo six months after my mom passed. Pearl Jam went on three hours long. I did the Glow In The Dark show here. My shit was going on when the motherfuckin' daylight was comin' on. They said I was runnin' late. They blared my motherfuckin' tanks, my cryo, my pyro, they wrote 'FUCK KANYE' on that shit. Y'all wrote that shit in the press. WHERE THE PRESS AT? Y'all gonna write all these motherfuckers puttin' they hands up right now? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? Man, I'll run that shit. This is real rock n' roll. If you ever grew up on real music, the reason why you write that shit about music? I'm from the South Side of Chicago. I dreamed of R. Kelly giving me a deal.\n\nSomebody told me that everybody on the plane was coming out here to Bonnaroo, to come check me out, and you know, it humbled me. It humbled me, and at the same time gave me confidence. It gave me a quiet confidence, a steel confidence, a feeling that it was actually gonna happen, a feeling that it was God's plan. God's plan. God's plan, something I could never understand, understand, understand, it's all in God's plan. God's plan. God's plan. God's plan \u2026 So whether you believe it or not \u2026 the fact that there are so many people here tonight, it humbles me. It humbles me\u2014but not in the Webster's definition of humility.

I wanted to vibe off an idea, and then I can riff off of that\u2026they said I\u2019ve got 20 minutes or so, I might go longer\n\nOK, everyone please be completely quiet, because I can literally hear a whisper, and it\u2019ll throw off my stream of consciousness, and when I get my stream of consciousness going that\u2019s when I give the best, illest quotes. Literally, a whisper can throw it off\n\nToday was the first time I realised, If I could have done it again I would have gone to the Art Institute over the American Academy of Art, I would have researched where I could have got the best and the strongest education\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure this will end up online, so I don\u2019t want to diss anyone at the American Academy, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s equal to the Art Institute of Chicago by now, but at the time I was going I would look around at the work of the class and not feel inspired by the teachers, and I kinda, the idea of being a fine artist, that\u2019s a really difficult profession to get into, to be respected in, to make money at.  Maybe the goal for some of the people was just to work at an advertising agency or at a record label\n\nMy goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater\n\nThat always sounds so funny to people, comparing yourself to someone in the past that has done so much, and in your life you\u2019re not even allowed to think that you can do as much. That\u2019s a mentality that suppresses humanity\n\nSome of you here probably remember the night when the Donda tweets came through me and I started talking about professions that you guys are going into, that seemed they had nothing to do with a rapper. I was talking about a band of thinkers that could remove religion, race, gender, and somehow come together to find solutions for a broken planet\n\nWe have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia, but we\u2019re led by the most greedy and the least noble\n\nWhat I notice about creatives is that, and one of the reasons why I get into trouble, is, not only do I want to design video games, or make music, or ride bikes, I think one of the most important things to my ability to create so much in the past 30 years is my desire to play sports. I approach creativity like a sport, where if I have a drawing I react just like a jock: LOOK AT THE FUCKING DRAWING RIGHT THERE YEAH!\n\nWe\u2019re all creatives here, we\u2019re all born artists. Some people are artists of business, some people are artists of composition\n\nWe were taught to hide our black fingernail polish and put our head down in the back of the class and not notice out of fear that someone might laugh at one of our ideas \u2013 that our idea could become a mockery or a failure in some way\n\nThere\u2019s a Bible saying, \u2018No weapon formed against me shall prosper\u2019. Recently I\u2019ve been doing interviews and I\u2019ve had to go back to this verse because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I also don\u2019t think there\u2019s one more prosperous. So what weapons have prospered? The smoke and mirrors of other opinions", "I was sitting with Steve McQueen, he shot the visuals for All Day two days ago, it\u2019s completely different to the Brit awards\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t get taken out of context, I\u2019m going to use the word \u2018like\u2019. I\u2019m not saying it is, I\u2019m using it as a comparison. So people that want to say \u2018Kanye goes to Oxford and tells everyone blah blah blah\u2019. And I\u2019m not telling you this. I\u2019m telling you what I told Steve McQueen in private\n\nWhat I said was The Matrix is like the Bible of the post-information age\n\nI compared it like, when the hundred guys come at Neo, those are opinions, that\u2019s perception, that\u2019s tradition. Attacking people from every which angle possible. If you have a focus wide and master senses like Laurence Fishburne and you have a squad behind you, you literally can put the world in slow motion\n\nIt\u2019s still February, right? (security guard shakes his head, everyone laughs)\n\nBy the way, I don\u2019t know the days of the week. I just go to exactly when my appointment is\n\nWe\u2019d just look at each other and say, it\u2019s still February. For the sheer mount of work that we were able to put into the world. Some of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming. But nonetheless they came back to back to back to back. Answering every crazy interview question, blocking every shot, catching every rebound. Aside from the right I don\u2019t have to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000. I know that\u2019s incorrect also\n\nThis humanity that I talk about, this civilization that I talk about, this future utopia I talk about\u2026it can only happen through collaboration\n\nI love Steve Jobs, he\u2019s my favorite person, but there\u2019s one thing that disappoints me. When Steve passed he didn\u2019t give the ideas up. That\u2019s kinda selfish. You know that Elon\u2019s like \u2018yeah, take these ideas\u2019. Maybe there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward. Maybe the stock brokers won\u2019t like that, the stock holders wouldn\u2019t like that idea, but ideas are free and you can\u2019t be selfish with them\n\nI think that progression of mind with the advent of a human being named Drake (laughs, smirks, crowd laughs) you know, this idea of holding onto a number 1 spot. And then you get this guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any band ever. Be it me, or Paul McCartney [laughs]\n\nI understand that I\u2019m a servant. And with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people. Call Elon Musk out of the blue, or call Obama out of the blue\u2026he calls the home phone, by the way\n\nWith that, I have a responsibility to serve. Why do I say the Matrix is like the Bible? What is my definition of the Matrix? [he never answered this]\n\nI work with an artist called Vanessa Beecroft, and she bought my daughter some toys\n\nI\u2019d see toys that some people would buy for my daughter and I\u2019d say this toy isn\u2019t quality. I don\u2019t want my daughter playing with this. There\u2019s not enough love put into this, this is just manufactured with the will to sell, and not the will of inspiration", "Vanessa is very focused, she\u2019s like my eyes, she\u2019s a piece of my brain. She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole collection, that it\u2019d play with the song Wolves, and based on this concept. And when my daughter saw these wolves, I\u2019ve never seen her so happy. She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of one\u2026I\u2019ve never seen her happier than this moment. That level of happiness seems to be the thing that we\u2019re fighting for every day, that we\u2019re trying to buy back, trying to work for, especially in America\n\nIn America people really do wear $3000 shirts. For real. Here and in Stockholm people will be like \u2018oh dude, it\u2019s a $3000 shirt\u2019\n\nI\u2019m assuming I\u2019m probably wearing a $2000 shirt but I got it for free from the designer so\n\nWe\u2019ve been sold a concept of joy through advertising, through car advertising, through fashion branding. It\u2019s not the concept of time, time with your family, time with your friends, the little time that we do have on earth and what we do with that. It was somehow sold to us through a Gucci bag or something\n\nTime is the only luxury. It\u2019s the only thing you can\u2019t get back. If you lose your luggage \u2013 I\u2019m not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I\u2019d normally say because I\u2019ve got a meeting with them soon \u2013 if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport, you can get that back. You can\u2019t get the time back\n\nIt feels like people do everything in life to get this BMW, this Benz, to get this townhome, to get 2.5 kids exactly. One of them has to be small, y\u2019know!\n\nAnd you\u2019re looking for this moment where you sit in your BMW after all the work you\u2019ve done and all the accolades you get, and you somehow think you\u2019re gonna get that level of joy that my daughter had when she received those wolves. And when you\u2019re sitting in traffic in your BMW, it\u2019s something that feels empty. To everyone who reaches that point. This concept of the selfish human, this idea of separation by race, or gender, or religion, or age, or my favourite thing to hate, class\n\nPeople say it takes a village to raise a child. People ask me how my daughter is doing. She\u2019s only doing good if your daughter\u2019s doing good. We\u2019re all one family\n\nWe have the ability to approach our race like ants, or we have the ability to approach our race like crabs\n\nThis is a generation that is far less racist \u2013 yes, small remnants remain of even thinking of calling something of a racial slur\n\nWhite people that listen to rap say \u2018nigger\u2019\u2026in the privacy of their own home\n\nThat idea [racism], has passed. We\u2019ve had The Cosby Show, Obama\u2019s president, Beyonce\u2019s great\u2026that\u2019s passed. But there\u2019s still something you\u2019re taught every day, especially in the UK, and that\u2019s division by class. Our main focus, in my opinion\u2026Imagine a world with no war, and imagine if everyone\u2019s main focus, more so than going out to a club, their main focus was to help someone else\n\nI was joking with an interviewer earlier today\u2026people talk about the number of viewers the Brits get, or the number of viewers the Grammys get. They need to do award shows for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I guess that doesn\u2019t sell as many MasterCard commercials. Oh, I mentioned a brand! [looks disappointed]\u2026I had two things\u2026I was trying to get a flawless victory on my speech! No offence to MasterCard\u2026but that was a big fucking logo in the middle!", "You guys have been taught, without you knowing, ways to separate yourselves from each other. If you\u2019re separated, you can be easily controlled. If you\u2019re too busy pointing fingers at each other, rather than holding hands, you can\u2019t get anything done\n\nYou know, Chris Rock called my album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u2026well, Chris Rock and everyone else at every single media publication called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the best album of the last 25 years. This only came through collaboration\n\nOne of the most memorable things about MBDTF was Nicki Minaj, and the fact that she kicked my ass, on my own song, on one of the best albums\u2026the best album \u2013 I\u2019m just saying what the critics said \u2013 of the last 25 years. The best album of the past 25 years that I spent a year and a half making, out there. I was exiled from my country, it was a personal exile, but exile. To come back and deliver my magnum opus of a work, and to be outshined\u2026to be beat by a girl, basically\n\nThis was necessary. I think it was one of the most important points of working on that album, was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is. Just think of a comparison, if you think about why did it take so long for the new Yeezys to come out? Why did I have to leave one group and go to another group? Why did that group not want to speak to me? I think the Yeezys I was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse. Because these guys were like \u2018we\u2019re worrying about this shoe, we\u2019re gonna put it on this celebrity\u2019. And the head\u2019s son would come and say \u2018my favourite shoe is the Yeezy\u2019. And it\u2019s like \u2018ahhh, I can\u2019t hear about these YEEZYS anymore!\u2019. Like everyone talking about Nicki\u2019s verse, \u2018I can\u2019t hear about this verse anymore!\u2019. It was gonna work for her anyway, but let\u2019s just say that in some way in helped give her exposure. She was able to go on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide. And it was not locked because of my career\n\nOne of my biggest Achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, the very person, can remove my ego, I think there\u2019s hope for everyone\n\nWhen I talk about collaboration and the creative process, the best idea wins", "I\u2019m proud of the consistency of the performances I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been out here. And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and being forced to work together. The best lighting guy on the planet, the best staging guy, the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason\u2026To be able to deliver, back to back to back, extremely successful, inspiring, groundbreaking, visual, visceral, creative moments that otherwise would have been challenged. And the kid from Chicago screaming from the top of the stage for 40 minutes in a row. I\u2019ve had to pull that card out a few times. Not particularly screaming, but remember, I will scream\n\nMy momma taught me that if I was in a grocery store and I\u2019m by myself and a stranger grabbed my hand, scream at the top of your fucking lungs. If I\u2019m at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we\u2019re going to use these moving lights, or we\u2019re gonna play the music right now before we define the look, or we\u2019re gonna cut the TV cameras in a traditional way. I\u2019ll scream at the top of my fucking lungs\n\nPeople say I have a bad reputation. I think I\u2019ve got the best reputation in the building. They want you to have a reputation of tucking your black nail polish into your pockets and sitting in the corner of the class, and not fighting for your ideas out of fear of being ridiculed\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favourite ones\u2026to be called crazy\n\nI remember when I was young and saw my dad working on computers. And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad guy. And the guys that helped him, that he had the voice to find, didn\u2019t have the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to his vision, to his dream, for it to be considered to be a success. But the success is that his successor will be successful in his lifetime. You could say \"But you are successful?\" i\u2019m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded to rich people. But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it\u2019s something that is beating out of my chest. \u2018Wait a second, I was middle class, and I didn\u2019t get to see none of this shit!\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s have an NBC telethon moment, and say that beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to not wear clothes, and also possibly too cold. That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do! Clothing should be like food. There should never be a $5000 sweater. You know what should cost $5000? A car should be $5000. And you know who should work on the car? The people that work on the $500,000 cars. All the best talent in the world needs to work for the people. And I am so fucking serious about this concept that I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it. Because I was 14 and middle class. I know what it felt like to not get what I have\n\nPeople say to me \u2018you\u2019re successful, what are you crying about?\u2019. I\u2019m crying about the people. I\u2019m crying about their daughters. Our daughters, as one family. What good is it? What good is anything that everyone can\u2019t have? Every ism. They think we\u2019re done with racism. What about elitism, what about separatism, what about classism? That\u2019s all", "Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me\nI don't want you, but I need you,\nI love you and I hate you at the very same time\n\nSee what I want so much, should never hurt this

I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.\nTaylor: Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better.

I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.\nTaylor: Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it.

Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine.\nTaylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.\nTaylor: \u2026awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous!

Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don\u2019t know, just \u2018Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it \u2026 so that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.\n\nTaylor: What would people \u2026 I guess it would just be, people would be like, \u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d And I had something to do with it, probably.", "Kanye: The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.\n\nTaylor: What does it say? [nervous laughter]\n\nKanye: It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I\u2019ve thought about this line for eight months, I\u2019ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it\u2019s the most controversial, so it\u2019s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?\n\nTaylor: Yeah\u2026", "Kanye: Okay, alright. It says\u2014wait a second, you sound sad.\n\nTaylor: Well, is it gonna be mean?\n\nKanye: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mean.\n\nTaylor: Okay, then let me hear it.\n\nKanye: Okay, um \u2026 and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like \u201cHuh? What? That\u2019s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.\u201d And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, \u201cOh God, this is the craziest sh\u2014! This is why I love Kanye,\u201d that kind of thing. It\u2019s like my wife\u2019s favorite f\u2014ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?\n\nTaylor: Okay.\n\nKanye: So it says, \u201cTo all my Southside n\u2014 that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.\u201d [chuckles]\n\nTaylor: [chuckles] That\u2019s not mean.\n\nKanye: Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I\u2019m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it\u2019s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, \u2018Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s super genius to have you be the one that says, \u2018Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it\u2019s like, I got like s\u2014 on my album where I\u2019m like, \u201cI bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain\u2019t love the same bitch.\u201d", "Taylor: Oh my [laughs]. I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not mean though. It doesn\u2019t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. I thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it\u2019s not. Um, so I don\u2019t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I\u2019m asked about, of course I\u2019m gonna be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d but um, I\u2019ll think about it.\n\nKanye: Yeah, you don\u2019t have to do\u2014you don\u2019t have to do the launch and retweet. That\u2019s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that\u2019s cool, then that\u2019s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.\n\nTaylor: You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they\u2019re gonna be like, \u201cWow,\u201d like this thing\u2014like they\u2019ll just turn it into something that \u2026 I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it\u2019ll be less cool \u2018cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, \u2018cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it\u2019s like almost \u2026 I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?\n\nKanye: Yeah.\n\nTaylor: I try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I\u2019m like this close to overexposure.\n\nKanye: Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.\n\nTaylor: I know, it\u2019s like a compliment, kind of [laughs].\n\nKanye: I had this line where I said\u2014and my wife really didn\u2019t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, \u201cTo all my Southside n\u2014 that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,\u201d and my wife was really not with that one. She was way more into \u201cShe owes you sex,\u201d but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s\u2014 that I was like, \u201cAhhh.\u201d\n\nTaylor: That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m kind of\u2014I mean, they\u2019re both really edgy, but that\u2019s the only thing about that line is that it\u2019s like gonna \u2026 It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don\u2019t give a fuck, so\u2026\n\nKanye: Yeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make\u2014\n\nTaylor: That\u2019s sweet.\n\nKanye: \u2014you feel good. I don\u2019t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I\u2019m mad at Nike, so people think like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He\u2019s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.\u201d\n\nTaylor: Why are people saying you\u2019re bullying Nike?\n\nKanye: Because on \u201cFacts\u201d I said like, \u201cYeezy, Nike out here bad, they can\u2019t give shit away.\u201d\n\nTaylor: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that\u2019s just what you do though.\n\nKanye: [laughs]\n\nTaylor: [laughs] I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s like possible to bully a company like Nike where\u2014I mean, um, yeah, I mean \u2026", "I wanted to take white trash t-shirts and make it a video. I wanted to make it as phony as possible. I wanted to show you that this is the type of imagery that has been presented to us for years, and the only difference is a black man in the middle.", "I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song. For the times that I've, like, defended myself... [Tape break] I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month! When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying. Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyonc\u00e9! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyonc\u00e9. As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it. Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns.\n\n[A female voice asks, \"Why are you so angry? What's the anger?\"] Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit! I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit. My mother died because of this shit. Fuck MTV.\n\nIt ain't no love. What the fuck was Pink performing? Don't nobody know that song. Pink performed twice! Two songs? How the fuck Pink perform twice, and I didn't even get asked to perform \"Heartless.\" \"Heartless\" is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter! I don't know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink! They put me in a fuckin' room and [inaudible - maybe \"projected it\"].\n\n[A male voice asks, \"How the fuck did Eminem get the Best Hip-Hop song in 2008?\"] Eminem won Best Video! Rap Video! Yo, when he won that shit, I was so happy. I was so happy I [unclear - \"ran all this shit,\" maybe]. I said, \"Nigga, I'm gon' do this until y'all put a bullet in my head. I'm runnin' up to y'all, put a...\" [tape cuts].", "So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn\u2019t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!\n\nBut I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be \u201carchitected.\u201d And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized.\n\nIf I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I\u2019ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.\n\nAnd I know that there\u2019s more creativity to happen. And I know that there\u2019s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there\u2019s people in offices that stop the creative people, and (who) are intimidated by actual good ideas.\n\nI believe that utopia is actually possible\u2014but we\u2019re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician\u2014I\u2019m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys\u2019 willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation.\n\nI\u2019m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it\u2014um, I\u2019m a bit self conscious because I\u2019m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it.

CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most\n\nYou know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?\n\nI had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs.

I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me.

Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.\n\nI don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.\n\nin life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act.

It\u2019s my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?\n\n[...]\n\nIt looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I\u2019ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.\n\nIt\u2019s colorless also. It\u2019s super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that\u2019s really what my style\u2019s always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.\n\nMy dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he\u2019d get around Black people and they\u2019d kinda discriminate against him because they\u2019d say he acted \u2018white\u2019 or talked \u2018white.\u2019 So there are times when I\u2019ll talk and you\u2019ll hear some of that white--or what people call \u2018white\u2019--the suburb voice come through and it\u2019s times you\u2019ll hear some of that Chicago come through. I\u2019m influenced by all those things.\n\nI lived in China when I was in fifth grade with my mother, she\u2019s an English professor, and she taught high-level English. And it was my hint at being a celebrity because they hadn\u2019t seen Black people on TV, so people would stare at me all the time.\n\n[...]\n\nThere will never be another Backstreet Boys, Not in this day and age. It\u2019s gonna be artists like Lorde, singer songwriters, that are gonna come up. This is Instagram, this is the information highway. And I talk to these heads, you know, these older dudes that run companies, and it\u2019s hilarious to me! I only listen to people who are younger than me! These are the only people with ideas. You cannot give me any advice! You can help me. You can support Donda. You can cut a check. But I have the ideas! No one older than me has a better idea than me because I\u2019m the only 36 year old me! I\u2019m the most relevant voice on the planet Earth, at age 36, post being the most hated. So don\u2019t try to tell me anything! Help me! Help me, help other people.\n\n[Do you talk to corporations like that? They don\u2019t like being uncomfortable.]\n\nWe are uncomfortable. 500 kids are dying in Chicago a year. We are uncomfortable. Just because we\u2019re being a gated community doesn\u2019t mean that things are comfortable.\n\nThe thing is, we have the resources on this planet to have a human utopia, to have respect for each other, mankind. We have that. But we\u2019re too concerned about getting the next Hollywood film on Netflix. We have the resources. There\u2019s new billionaires everyday. You apply the right type of thinkers, like the Elon Musks, the people with the real ideas.\n\nLike, politics is dead. It\u2019s over with.

Why did we boo the first time on something that wasn\u2019t, \u201cHey, do you like Trump?\u201d That wasn\u2019t what I asked. I asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided.\n\nHow that make you think, though? The fact that I just asked that undeniable question? That in most music situations you have the Democrats always since the beginning of time. The Democrats were considered to be more liberal. The Democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach. The Democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you. Democrat is like music to your ears or something. Bye. Your voices. Do you believe\u2013what percentage of people here\u2013and by the way, I\u2019m not setting y\u2019all up, I\u2019m not setting y\u2019all up I\u2019ve got no time for bullshit\u2013what I\u2019m saying is, what percentage of people here do you think voted for Trump? Do you think it was two people here? Do you think maybe it was 100 people? Do you think maybe it was 1,000 people out of the 15,000 people here? No, I\u2019m asking you, what do you really believe? One person. Two people. What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe?", "I haven\u2019t talked about anybody\u2019s stances on anything. I haven\u2019t talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking \u2019bout. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking you. What I\u2019m asking you is what you really believe. I put something that I would bet on. I bet that it might be 20 percent or maybe even 30 percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for Trump. I bet you 15 percent, 50 percent of them, would never say that at a Kanye West show because of the climate right now. And they don\u2019t know they might think I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, they voted for Trump... y\u2019all should go ahead and\u2026.\u201d It\u2019s the opposite of that. People got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for. That\u2019s the right to vote! That is our right! I did not vote. Aww, no. The Saint Pablo ticket sales are going down now. Aww no, t-shirts. \u201cAww nah, you just got out of jail Ye. You had to deal with the Taylor Swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some... naw, Ye don\u2019t say shit. Just step out.\u201d Fuck that, bro. That\u2019s the reality.\n\nWell, Ye, how you gonna expect people to vote for you if you ain\u2019t even vote? I\u2019m concerned not about the idea of being president or the actual job of it. I\u2019m concerned about putting our concept of how to do the job in a new way. And if no one will do it in that way I will take position in 2020 and do it myself. \u201cAw you ain\u2019t gonna get it now because of what you just said.\u201d It was proof that it didn\u2019t matter what nobody just said! It doesn\u2019t matter!\n\nIt might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say, \u201cOh, this rapper\u201d because when they call me a rapper they try to say that I\u2019m less than thinking, less than a philosopher. But rappers are the philosophers of our now. The rappers all form a sense of our now. The celebrities are the influencers of our now. Just look at the president. He wasn\u2019t even in politics and he won! That shows you not if you mad about him winning, but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don\u2019t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you! There is possibilities! There\u2019s possibilities inside of books. There\u2019s possibilities when you call grandmother. Motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother. To get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago! Do you ever want to be blindsided like that?", "Don\u2019t trivialize what I was saying when I talked about our president\u2019s approach to the campaign when I said it was entertaining. I don\u2019t think his approach was just entertaining, because that trivializes it, I actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked!

What do you believe? That\u2019s your opinion. Express your opinion, bro. Express your opinion. Thank you. That\u2019s a woman right there saying, \u201cI love you,\u201d after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump\u2019s campaign. That\u2019s not supposed to happen, right? No! That\u2019s not supposed to happen, right? Case in point. Aw, no. Well, no. I guess we\u2019re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now. There\u2019s methods, nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like that I feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that. You threw something at me! Naw, he wanted me to sign his Yeezy.\n\nI don\u2019t say 2020 out of disrespect to our president at all. I\u2019m not saying that, \u201cAw man, that just mean that anybody can win.\u201d That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying when I say 2020. I\u2019ll just say I got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more. So there's things that Benjamin Carson believes in... that I believe in. I believe that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. Obama said... I think Obama should still be a consultant. It\u2019s that, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t fuck with your principles so now I\u2019m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us.\u201d Make sure this dude that got the Yeezy get his Yeezy back, specifically. Hey, security, get it back.\n\nMan, and you know what also? I\u2019m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the Democratic side, that\u2019s cool, I just like... I hate the fact that because I\u2019m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It\u2019d be like white people that\u2019s racist running around saying \u201cniggas\u201d now.

I have synesthesia; I can see sound in front of me. So, when I want to do fashion, I just want to give you sculptures. So it\u2019s like Michelangelo; the church wanted him to paint, and he just wanted to do sculptures. So the hard \u2013 the difficult thing for me that everyone doesn\u2019t understand, I just want to be able to use marble and make sculptures.

It\u2019s like: why don\u2019t you just do music? It\u2019s an overall creative expression. Like I have a friend, Yves B\u00e9har, that designed the Jawbone wristband and stuff, and the Jambox and everything. As a designer, you know, he's not in a box to only design, you know, a speaker.

And people are like now in this day and age, if you don't believe it, it's like they're like \"No, Kanye, you can't run faster. This is the limit that was made.

I want to be scared. I\u2019m trying my best to be scared. I\u2019m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don\u2019t want to talk. I don\u2019t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I\u2019m just going to tip-toe on this\n\nI\u2019m scared of anonymous comments online. I\u2019m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn\u2019t give me already. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared.  I\u2019m so shook. I\u2019m so, so scared. So scared. Soooo\n\nYou ain\u2019t never seen, you ain\u2019t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y\u2019all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y\u2019all for giving me this moment in time. \u2019Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There\u2019s so many people have a moment and they don\u2019t own it\n\nYou know, it\u2019s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there\u2019s the connotation of that. But what I need y\u2019all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y\u2019all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y\u2019all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius", "\u2019Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it\u2019s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you\u2019re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you\u2019re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth\n\nYou watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they\u2019re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren\u2019t going to talk about the money we made. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had\n\nAnd being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, \u201cBaby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.\u201d And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn\u2019t be no song called \u201cNiggas in Paris\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. \u2019Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star\n\nBut what\u2019s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. \u2019Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don\u2019t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time\n\nAnd the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he\u2019s at the such and such show, and that\u2019s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can\n\nSo I said, \u201cWait a second, though.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,\u201d and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d They said, \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d Don\u2019t let me sing because I want y\u2019all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, \u201cHey that\u2019s cute, that\u2019s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.\u201d Like it\u2019s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn\u2019t be no Kanye west if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I\u2019m saying?", "But the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don\u2019t want to break their motherfucking cool, don\u2019t nobody want to look like a fool\nMy boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn\u2019t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don\u2019t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they\u2019re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I\u2019m saying? Have y\u2019all ever read or heard someone say, \u201cI don\u2019t like Kanye West\u201d?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn, I wish I could be likeable like them.\u201d I wish people would like me like that\n\nSo what they basically did was, at Fashion Week\u2026 Let me explain something to you\u2026 I don\u2019t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That\u2019s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized\n\nSo if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn\u2019t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he\u2019s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let\u2019s rewind, is above a music producer, and it\u2019s above a rapper\n\n\u2019Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can\u2019t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you\u2019re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, \u201cI am a god!\u201d Just for them to let you a little bit up", "But you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell\u2019s such a nice guy. \u2019Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted\u2014I didn\u2019t price it, but the world reacted to it\u2014I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this [gestures back to his stage setup], that\u2019s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. West, but you\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else again.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and I said, \u201cBut wait a second. I sold out.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.\u201d\n\nAnd right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. \u2019Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?\n\nAnd what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I\u2019m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin\u2019 tight jeans that you want. I\u2019m the nigga that, you know I\u2019m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can\u2019t go to Riccardo\u2019s show and you can\u2019t go to Phoebe\u2019s show", "But he wouldn\u2019t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn\u2019t say that to [?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y\u2019all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what\u2019s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do tell me I can\u2019t go to these shows again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I\u2019m a musician, I don\u2019t have any ideas for clothing again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?\n\nBut I\u2019mma tell y\u2019all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I\u2019mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal from people\u2019s ideas like H&M. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal people\u2019s ideas like Zara. We gon\u2019 make our own shit. We gon\u2019 combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon\u2019 take them from Harvard, and we gon\u2019 take them from St. Mark's, and we gon\u2019 take \u2019em from the street\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. I\u2019m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I\u2019m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song\u2026\n\nHold up, hold up. I\u2019m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin\u2019 now! Almost forgot that part", "[Mike Myers]: With the breach of three levees protecting New Orleans, the landscape of the city has changed dramatically, tragically, and perhaps irreversibly. There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.\n\n[Kanye West]: I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says \u201cthey\u2019re looting.\u201d If you see a white family, it says \u201cthey\u2019re looking for food.\u201d And you know, it\u2019s been five days because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about I would be a hypocrite because I\u2019ve tried to turn away from the TV because it\u2019s too hard to watch. I\u2019ve even been shopping before even giving a donation.  So now I\u2019m calling my business manager right now to see what\u2019s\u2026 what is the biggest amount I can give and\u2026 and just to imagine if I was\u2026 if I was down there and those are\u2026 those are my people down there.

I want to say some \"thank you\"s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what Ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this\n\nSo, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, \"You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude.\" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the money\n\nAnd it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote \"Nigga lover\" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"Dad why you going so crazy?\" He said to her, \"One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.\"\n\nSo, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea\n\nHarriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool\n\nI thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don't never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don't only do it for us, do it for the human race", "Yo, I'mma rise to the top cause it ain't in me to fail\nOr die bustin' at the cops before they send me to jail\nThe same nigga ya serve with won't even send you the bail\nAnd sail with some niggas tryin' to send me to hell\nSo whether\nRap or crack\nBeats or streets\nThis summer I'm rockin' ice to beat the heat\nNow I'm gonna cop a Benz 6 and tell 'em \"Keep the Jeep\nKeep the receipt, keep the change, keep the game.\"\nAs long as I keep the fame and keep my name\nKanye to the\nMotherfuckin' West\nShe said, \"You from The Outfit?\"\nI told her, \"Motherfuckin' yes.\"\nSo every time I spit, it's got to be fresh\nSo whether freestyle or written\nWhat's the point of rhyme?\nI'd rather hear somethin' bitten, as long as it's hittin'\nWack niggas grab my tracks, just get to shittin'\nMy niggas grab they gats, just get to spittin'\nFaggot niggas be like, \"Uh huh, no he didn't.\"\nBut I did\nEver since I hooked with Syndicate\nAnd shit\nI've been blazin' niggas ever since\nYa heard me?\nBlazin' niggas ever since", "[Answering Machine]\n\"...394 is not available.

Which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business. You know, you can't--\n\nEllen: Beautiful\n\nKanye: And I've learned how to shut up more and, um, I've--yeah. I think--I think I'm a better human being, you know, because of her\nAnd because of my daughter. And I have, you know, always someone to think about going home to and, you know, something for me to, you know, not only be brave for what I wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too. Cause there's things I've done in the past that were considered negative, but I was really, you know, jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way. So now I always have to have that in my mind, that I have, like, a family that I have to protect too\n\nEllen: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I do see that change in you. I see you-- And you are calmer, I think. You know, you don't seem, like, uh... like, uh...angry or--you know? You know what I mean? And I don't know if it was even anger, but it was just the way that you were getting all of your emotions out. And now I think your emotions\nAre grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love, and--and--they're going-- they're channeled\nIn a different way\n\nKanye: I think I was, like, going through now, like, my version of my terrible twos. My--my daughter, she wants to express herself, but she just doesn't have the words for it. And for me, there's so many things I wanna do with film, with clothing, and I just didn't have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that I could do it, being that I was a rapper or, you know, all these things. And now, because of this Adidas deal, they allowed me a little bit of oxygen. Because what you have to understand-- The difference between, you know, what people give you about celebrity, the idea of money versus creativity. There's no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative, if you were born to create. So a lot of times people try to block you, block your creativity, control you with money. And Adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line, which I wanted to do, and it was just like a little bit of oxygen. You guys last year, two years ago, three--whatever. You guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception. Being suffocated by people in a position that could\nBlatantly see like, \"Wow, the \"Yeezys\" did really good. He was this influential. All those albums did this. But we're not gonna give him\nA shot in something else.\"  And there's a lot of people who, like, were really calm about that. But the definition of crazy is trying to do the same thing and expecting a different result. So I tried something different over the past couple years. And I actually got some really good results from it too, so...\n\n\nEllen: Well put. Well put. And that is true. I mean, I think we all try to express ourselves. And you do, you keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing and saying the same thing. It doesn't get\nThe result you want until you try a different way of expressing yourself or whatever it is, and then you get the result because you've shifted. We have to take a break. And then we're gonna show the world premiere of your new video, which I absolutely love. I love this song so much. You actually played it for me in our living room, and I just was blown away how beautiful the song is\n\nCut\n\nEllen: So, uh, more kids?\n\nKanye: Yeah, we're trying", "Ellen: Really?\n\nKanye: Yeah, yeah\n\nEllen: I thought I'd slip that in there. I mean, that baby is so adorable, and, I mean, she is precious. She's so-- And smart as can be, right?\n\nKanye: Mm-hmm\n\nEllen: Yeah, she's-- Oh, look at that. So you're gonna have more? How many do you want, like a bunch? Like a Brad and Angie bunch? Or, uh--\n\nKanye: I just want whatever Kim wants\n\nEllen: Wow. Um... That's--that's a good answer, whether it's true or not. And what is the name of the CD?\n\nKanye: I don't know yet. We're still trying to find it. Trying to find the vibe. You know, this transition from what I felt when I did \"Yeezus\" to what I feel now, and, you know, we're just creating. So we haven't found it yet\n\nEllen: Okay. What about \"Ellen's My Friend\"?\n\nKanye: Yeah.

If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner\n\neveryone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\".

Fantastic,\u201d Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie Nickerson\n\nMcQueen related how the project came about\n\n\u201cMe and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, \u2018I\u2019m at Dover Street Market, where are you?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m at Dover Street Market,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days. That\u2019s Kanye: It\u2019s been a wild ride.\u201d\n\nThe director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-tops\n\nIn an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativity", "\u201cAs a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn\u2019t been for my experience in Paris \u2014 learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light,\u201d said West, a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage, upon which images of boiling clouds, waterfalls, stars and smoky forests were projected. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the show,\u201d he pleaded\n\nWhile a divisive figure in fashion \u2014 many are put off by his front-row ubiquity and often surly behavior \u2014 West clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style, art and music intersect. The hip-hop artist lauded the creative people \u201cthat work here, the city itself, the music that\u2019s played at the shows, the colors, the palettes. I actually get a lot that I take back and put into music.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s ties to LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton stretch back to 2006, when he performed at a Fendi event in Tokyo, later collaborating with Louis Vuitton on a sneaker range in 2009\n\nMore recently, after meeting at a Givenchy show, West struck up a friendship with Alexandre Arnault, who doffed his Dior Homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends, mouthing the words to songs on the playlist, which included \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d and \u201cNi\u2013as in Paris.\u201d\n\nA tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea. \u201cWhen I saw it, I was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art. I just asked would it be OK for me to do a performance there,\u201d West said\n\nTickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charity\n\nMeanwhile, Kardashian had spent part of Saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks, which had assumed a yellow cast, not the platinum she was after\n\n\u201cHe fully got the color right. And it\u2019s so perfect, I\u2019m like, \u2018Don\u2019t make me fly out to Paris every time I need to color my hair,\u2019\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m happy with it. It\u2019s a look. But I have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like, \u2018Huh, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nKardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had references of Madonna with platinum hair. They\u2019ve been on my computer forever, \u201d she said, letting slip that she would keep the color for an upcoming campaign, but clammed up on the brand\n\nLike West, Kardashian keeps a rein on her image, noting that the black coat slung over her shoulders at the concert, which she took off as the heat intensified, was a C\u00e9line style she altered to her liking, making it slimmer, changing the color from white to black, and adding a fur collar\n\n\u201cMy mom has the one that\u2019s just as is. So I feel like mine\u2019s a little special,\u201d she said\n\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s a really dope coat,\u201d West concurred", "Lyrics from a snippet\n\n[Verse: 2 Chainz]\nShower water hit that black skin, your friend alive for you (Alive for you)\nAir dry, let me suck that...", "[Hook]\nTh-Th-The League Crew\nN-now th-that that don't kill me\nCan only make me stronger\nI need you to\u2005hurry\u2005up now\nCause I\u2005can't wait much longer\nI know I\u2005got to be right now\nCause I can't get much wronger\nMan\u205fI've\u205fbeen\u205fwaiting all night\u205fnow (Commissioner!)\nThat's how\u205flong I been on ya (Terry Urban)\n(I need you right now!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen the fast life takes its tole\nThat act right makes everything slow\nThem black lights make everything glow\nOne of those nights where everything goes\nEverybody goes through something\nPeople be talking to you like you nothing\nThen you be like bitch I'm me\nThen your boss be like bitch then leave\nYou covered up your tats too long with them sleeves\nYou've gotta hit the club let the real you breathe\nWould you believe, you'll never shine if you're not seen\nSo get all in they face like Noxzema\nI know you mesmerized about that ass in them jeans\nPlease don't hit that raw, it's not clean\nPlease don't forget that all when it seems\n\n[Hook]\nN-now th-that that don't kill me\nCan only make me stronger\nI need you to hurry up now\nCause I can't wait much longer\nI know I got to be right now\nCause I can't get much wronger\nMan I've been waiting all night now\nThat's how long I been on ya\n(I need you right now!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet's get lost tonight\nYou could be my black Kate Moss tonight\nPlay secretary, I'm the boss tonight\nAnd you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?\nAwesome, the Christian in Christian Dior\nDamn, they don't make 'em like this anymore\nI ask, cause I'm not sure\nDo anybody make real shit anymore?\nBow in the presence of greatness\nCause right now thou hast forsaken us\nYou should be honored by my lateness\nThat I would even show up to this fake shit\nSo go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit\n'Specially in my Pastel, on my Bape shit\nAct like you can't tell who made this\nNew Gospel homie, take 6, and take this, haters\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't know if you got a man or not\nIf you made plans or not\nIf God put me in ya plans or not\nI'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot\nBut I know that God put you in front of me\nSo how the hell could you front on me?\nThere's a thousand yous, there's only one of me\nI'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?\nCause it's Louis Vuitton Don night\nSo we gon' do everything that Kan like\nHeard they'd do anything for a Klondike\nWell, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke\nAnd she'll do anything for the limelight\nAnd we'll do anything when the time's right\nUh, baby you're makin' it\n(Harder, better, faster, stronger)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nYou know how long I've been on ya\nSince Prince was on Apollonia\nSince O.J. had Isotoners\nDon't act like I never told ya"]}
