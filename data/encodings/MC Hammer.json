The voice on the other end was a high pitched fast talking young man. He was nervous but sincere. He said, \"MC Hammer I can sing and I need you to hear me.\" I replied, \"Who is this? And how did U get my home number?\" He said, \"My name is Pleasure, I live in Wichita, Kansas, and I was wondering if U would help me with my dream of becoming a recording star.\" I was impressed with his ability to hustle up my home number (now that's resourceful!). I told Pleasure to send me his demo and I would get back to him after I've heard it.\n\nWell, I got the demo in the mail and I like what I heard. He was raw, and needed grooming and artist development but I saw and heard a diamond in the rough. Although at the time I was concentrating on my ministry, I new I could provide Pleasure the artist development and leadership he needed. So I sent him a plane ticket and moved him to California and began the process.\n\nTo my surprise Pleasure was a tireless pupil. He would work hard on the dances and he would rehearse and sing all day long. Each year he got better and better at comprehending the art of recording and performing. I took him around the world with me and put him on stage in front of hundreds of thousands. He became infallible. The crowds in every country loved him! He has that special \"it.\" He is ready and now I will introduce him to the world. He has a heart for the people and his songs will move U. I will soon release his album, \"The Pleasure Principle\".\n\nHis journey begins this week as he is co-featured on the video for the song \"Get2NOU\", from The Look3X digital music project. I am elated and filled will joy to watch the launch of an artist that has so much to give to the world. I give U, \"Pleasure Ellis\"!!!", "Hammer hart es ist hammer hart\nJa wir Feier immer hammer hart\nDer baum steht aber ist hart Hammer hart es ist hammer hart\nJa wir Feier immer hammer hart\nDer baum steht aber ist hart"]}
