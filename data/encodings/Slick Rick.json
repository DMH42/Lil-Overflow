Yeah\nHere we go\n\n[Verse]\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nWhen people wore pajamas and lived life slow\nWhen laws were stern and justice stood\nAnd people were behavin' like they ought to: good\nThere lived a little boy who was misled\nBy another little boy and this is what he said:\n\"Me and you, tonight we're gonna make some cash\nRobbin' old folks and makin' the dash\"\nThey did the job, money came with ease\nBut one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease\nHe robbed another and another and a sister and her brother\nTried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover\nThe cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic\nHe said \"Keep still, boy, no need for static\"\nPunched him in his belly and he gave him a slap\nBut little did he know the little boy was strapped\nThe kid pulled out a gun, he said \"Why'd you hit me?\"\nThe barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney\nThe cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure\n\"I'll do years if I pull this trigger\"\nSo he cold dashed and ran around the block\nCop radios in to another lady cop\nHe ran by a tree, there he saw this sister\nShot for the head, he shot back but he missed her\nLooked 'round good and from expectations\nSo he decided he'd head for the subway stations\nBut she was coming and he made a left\nHe was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath\nKnocked an old man down and swore he killed him\nThen he made his move to an abandoned building\nRan up the stairs up to the top floor\nOpened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?)\nDave, the dope fiend shootin' dope\nWho don't know the meaning of water nor soap\nHe said \"I need bullets, hurry up, run!\"\nThe dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun\nHe went outside but there was cops all over\nThen he dipped into a car \u2012 a stolen Nova\nRaced up the block doing 83\nCrashed into a tree near university\nEscaped alive though the car was battered\nRat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered\nRan out of bullets and he still had static\nGrabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic\nPointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead\nHe told the cops \"Back off or honey here's dead\"\nDeep in his heart he knew he was wrong\nSo he let the lady go and he starts to run on\nSirens sounded, he seemed astounded\nAnd before long the little boy got surrounded\nHe dropped his gun, so went the glory\nAnd this is the way I have to end this story\nHe was only seventeen, in a madman's dream\nThe cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream\nThis ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh\nJust another case about the wrong path\nStraight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast\nGood night\n\n[Outro]\n(Knock him out the box, Rick\nKnock him out, Rick)\n- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird\n- I know right what does he mean\n\u201cStraight and narrow or yo\u2019 soul gets cast\"?\n- I don\u2019t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something\n- Well, good night\n- Good night\n\nAnother (that's right!)

have the nerve to dispatch this\nWho can i get to help me murder this fat chick\nI guess i'll have to play a dude robbin\nOn wednesday The day she usually goes food shopping\nAnyway long story short hit the side of her Chrysler\nAnd sent her clean over the divider\n\"You bastard\" she said\nAs the wreck went tumblin down the hill I thought \"she has to be dead\"\nLater on get a call (from a)

time, not long ago\nWhen people wore pajamas and life slow\nWhen laws were stern and justice stood\nAnd people were behaving really, really good\nThere were three mean giants that came from the east\nThey were up to no good and some ugly beast\nThey lived in the forest where no one goes\nAnd were evilly inflicted from their head to their toes\nEverytime they came around and snatched a few humans up\nThey'd eat their poor souls and throw their bones in a cup\nFor years and years the peasants lived in fear\nBut nothing could be done besides to pray, my dear\nFor the giants were rulin' and the peasants were not\nAnd the little bit of happiness was now forgot\nSo three brave boys full of smokin' youth\nWent on a mission trip to find the king of truth\nFor when he come, justice be done\nNone only as the most high ruler, son\nNone only as the most high ruler, son\nNone only as a hoe's high ruler, son\nHit it!\n\nSo the story is, what is to come?\nWill the peasants survive and justice be done?\nOr will the giants continue to rule as one?\nWell, nevertheless we'll see son\nStory's begun\n\n[Outro]\n*Kid humming along the melody*\nHeyo, imma stop right there", "(featuring
