So people expect that from you\nSo it feels like, almost, homage to that but next level\nLike the beat by Spaceghostpurrp takes it next level\nThe way the Seldgren's changing the sound a little bit\nTakes it next level production-wise\nAnd then you take it, next level\n\nI'm glad you fuck with it\nAnd that's what it's all about\nTaking it to the next level\nElaborating on what we've done\nBecause a lot of people\nThey've elaborated on what we've done"

Time to renovate\nBoy tighten up your circle, keep your business straight\n\n[Chorus]\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe the niggas who could have it all\nWe the ones who only dream of it then do it on our own\nSmoking one and got another roll\nCame a long way from no direction now to formation\nMore legit, more to make, more to spend\nGot a thing for champagne? Order it\nWaking up in my trap house burning hella spliffs, grinding\nListening to Dolomite rhyming, I\u2019m in\nExclusive bay, break you off something and I\u2019ve got moves to make\nDon\u2019t be acting bougie \u2018cause you came through with Nate\nNo Reuss, real nigga before Protools\nGot game from niggas that's from the old school\nBut we them new niggas,  you should roll through\nWoke up in the morning fucked up but that\u2019s part of it\nI got weed smoke and all this gin, Khalifa always wins\n\n[Chorus]\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'"

You can't understand\nBank in my hand, your bitch think I'm the man\nYes I am\n\n[Hook: K Camp]\nWhen you stay out and your chopper stay focused\nShe gone be the best\nDo what you can when your team get a chance\nPut it all to the test\nCame for it all, know you heard this before but\nI don't more less\nGrindin', you fall now you done with the tour\nGet it all off your chest\nHustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'\nThat's all they respect\nHustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'\nThat's all they respect\nHustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'\nThat's all they respect\nWhen you go hard\nYou go hard and don't stop until ain't nothin' left\n\n[Verse 2: Juicy J]\nAll my pockets overweight\nAppetite for all this cake\nMoney man, I still run this game\nI'm in perfect shape\nMoonrocks, keep me high as tube socks, bird one\nKeep it pimpin' and pay close attention, you might learn somethin'\nMy family is all I need, I make sure that we gon' eat\nOvertime, 25 hours, 8 days a week\nI remember back when I was broke, how could I forget?\nNine bathrooms in my crib, I got a pot to piss\nMy look my momma's face when I bought her a new home\nMy mom, we finally made it, them hard times is gone\nFinally made it legit, ain't no way I'mma quit\nGot a cone full of guacamole, let's go get these chips\n(Hustlin', hustlin')\nAll the money coming in so fast you can't resist\n(Hustlin', hustlin')\nCause there ain't no such thing as gettin' too rich\n(Hustlin', hustlin')\nYou will never hear me say I don't want no more\n(Hustlin', hustlin')\nThis Juicy J and gettin' to the money is all I know\n\n[Hook: K Camp]\nWhen you stay out and your chopper stay focused\nShe gone be the best\nDo what you can when your team get a chance\nPut it all to the test\nCame for it all, know you heard this before but\nI don't more less\nGrindin', you fall now you done with the tour\nGet it all off your chest\nHustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'\nThat's all they respect\nHustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'\nThat's all they respect\nHustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'\nThat's all they respect\nWhen you go hard\nYou go hard and don't stop until ain't nothin' left\n\n[Outro: Juicy J]\nYo nigga keep it real with your motherfuckin' self and grind for your motherfuckin' self.

They say nothin'\nWhere they goin'? They say nothin'\nCall my phone, it ain't nothin'\nI smoke a lot, but don't judge me\nProlly wake up earlier than all of you niggas\nMafuckas always hate on the squad\nBut all the hatin' mafuckas always hatin ain't get paid\n\n[Chorus]\nMan, I work hard\nMan, I work hard (fuck!)\nMan, I work hard (I mean like goddamn what you want me to say?)\nMan, I work hard (it's what I do!)\nIt ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)\nIt ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)\nIt ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)\nNo pain\nMan, I work hard"

Nigga, I ain't no fool (Uh-uh, hahaha)\n\n[Verse 2]\nStill keep it real, still park the whip and chill\nStill never poppin' pills, still got 'em in they feels\nStill give 'em chills, peel hundred dollar bills\nHad a crib in the hills, one trip, couple mil'\nHow a nigga fall asleep and still makin' sales?\nOne hand on the wheel, couple bands on the meal\nPlayin' on the field, weigh it on a scale\nIn the air for twenty hours, I was unavailable\nSeen how much I'm worth, started thinkin' I was dateable\nAll my niggas gettin' rich, dues, I done paid a few\nSmokin' weed by the zip, millions, I done made a few\nState to state, I'm stackin' up and stayin' out the way\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBig bag, I want a big bag\nIf it ain't gettin' money, you can skip that (Skip that)\nBig bag, I want a big bag\nPut you in a Rolls-Royce, let you kick back\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm still Wiz (Still Wiz)\nNiggas got me in that mood (In that mood)\nHow they hatin' when they know that I'm that dude? (I'm that dude)\nI hear they hatin' 'cause they know I got the juice (Got the juice), uh-huh (Yeah)\nThey like ooh, they watchin' how I move (How I move)\nMotherfuckers, they be actin' like we cool (Like we cool)\nFuck you thought this was?

I might invest\n\n[Chorus]\nI stay stoned, I stay stoned\nCause weed is legal (weed is legal)\nLet's get higher, up to the ceiling, ooh\nI stay stoned, I stay stoned\nCause weed is legal (weed is legal)\nBitch don't you blow my high, ohh"

That's what we do god dammit, the glasses go with the shirt, with that, fuckin' chains, with the buckles on my shoes, you know what I'm saying?\n\n[Verse 1]\nLotta y'all got it fucked up\nWe started it, we gone, and this shit, what you think this is?\nHow you think you got in the benz?\nI'ma roll a joint, write me a verse, before I finish it\nBad broad who I'm chillin' with\nWe gonna shoot a video so the whole world witness it\nYoung fly business man, got no love for the middleman\nAnd you know we sip champagne with lunch, smoke J's and stunt\nCame up but we ain't change much\nI probably got a fitting, got another awards show\nI smell just like a plant every time I pull up\nThey wanna be like us but that don't flatter me\nI'd rather be stacking cheese with the ones I call my family, don't ever question why y'all mad at me\nYou look at now what I have, I'm moving forward that's a thing in the past, gang\n\n[Chorus]\nI got so much love for you (2x)\nI got so many people trying to rep my gang\nAnd I love them all the same\n\n[Verse 2]\nTime to let it go\nIf you a freak, let me know, make this night unforgettable\nYeah you try to start me off slow\nBut I ain't with that no mo'\nI get the drugs so you hit the do'\nDon't need to tell me what you've seen before\nYou in a whole another game\nNothing like them mama, roll with the gang\nAnd while your girls acting so strange\nBecause my dog put her in a place\nShe should've known that before she came\nI'm trying to put you on a different wave\nLet you hit the J, relax your mind, ain't gotta fuss with me\nAfter we smoke you know what's next\nWe go to the room, you get undressed, you tell your friends I'm the best\nI like where you going\nAnd from the things that you saying, you might be the one\nLet's take a couple shots back and get out of control\nAin't got no rules but you already know, I'll make you mine, know you need to roll\n\n[Chorus]\nI got so much love for you (2x)\nI got so many people trying to rep my gang (Taylor Gang)\nAnd I love them all the same\n\n[Outro]\nYou already know who it is, nigga\nWe flyin' more than we drivin', it's 2016, so, I'm OG'in this shit by now\nI still keep in touch though\nRoll up that good weed, keep smokin' them planes\nBest of the best man\nDrop a KK, pack off in every home in America\nUh, T-G-O-D\nWhy I got a filter on my voice?\n(I got so much love for you)"

The top of the world?\nTop floor, there's weed in the ashtray\nIt's top-shelf, cap!\n\n[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]\nRiding in my Challenger, faded off this weed brownie\nTurning down the music cause the weed is loud enough already\nNiggas ask me 'bout my pay, I say I keep it steady\nGripping on the wheel, spending money like a politician\nTipping on a bill, it's going down\nLike this bitch was sitting on the hill\nI keep my girlfriend in them expensive sort of heels and furs and shit\nEat champagne and lobster cause I fucking deserve this shit\nCap! Niggas say I've got an old soul\nWell, I tell them that I'm here muh'fucka\nAnd I made it cause my flow cold\nI'ma roll some of this weed\nI'ma pass it to you and we gon' be so gone\nHomie, I got papers and vaporizers\nFlavors to stablize ya\nThoroughly-baked cake, can't say a thing with my eyes shut\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey say they do (they do, they do, they do)\nBut they don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)\nWho we are (who we are, who we are, who we are)\nSuperstars\n\n[Verse 2: Curren$y]\nUhh, I'm out of here, stratosphere\nPaper hella-straight, nappy hair\nBitches seem not to care that you was even there\nWhen we pulled up lit like Times Square\nWhen we pulled up lit like road flares\nWhen we pulled off, them hoes disappeared\nBecause they know what we be doing over here\nShe just wanna be high in her underwear\nWith her iPhone plugged in the wall, power low\nStepping out the shower, threw her a shirt to towel off with\nOne of the two qualities I want in a bitch\nCause baby girl fuckin with me is some major shit\nFair warning: I gotta wake up to a BJ every morning\nAnd a J while I'm yawning, darling\nI got papers and vaporizers, flavors to stablize ya\nI'm a fully baked potato, spending my cheddar and chives\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey say they do (they do, they do, they do)\nBut they don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)\nWho we are (who we are, who we are, who we are)\nSuperstars\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nI'm dedicated, hella-faded, high as hell, I'm levitating\nI'm rolling up, fuck a wheelchair, ironically, my shit's medicated\nYour eyes closed cause you asleep, my eyes closed cause I'm meditating\nI gotta go make reservations, at a real nigga's destination\nTwo girls in the tub, that's luxury\nYou disagree? That's fuckery, saying, \"Fuck you\" cause you can't fuck with me\nI need my dick sucked, but I'm sucka-free, you are who it sucks to be\nI'm accompanied by Finally Famous Over Everything, that's my company\nYou already know, nigga\nCollect the money like it's old, nigga\nAnd I'ma blow it like it's rolled, nigga\nAnd I be stuntin 'til I'm old, nigga\nWeed, money and hoes - what a hell of a night!\nFuck you mean? This is everyday life\nShe in the mirror making sure that she wearing it right\nIt's apparent she present where I'm appearing tonight\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey say they do (they do, they do, they do)\nBut they don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)\nWho we are (who we are, who we are, who we are)\nSuperstars"

You ain't even gotta ask these niggas\nI'mma fuck around and take these niggas' last three pictures\nMan these bitches breaking they neck just to pass weed with us\nWe roll, get high, get drunk, more shots, reload\nToo high, he knows, three more, C4, we blow\nBitch, how could you be so fine?\nShake that ass, she so mine\nTaking more double shots than free throw lines\nI might hit like three, four times\nThey say \"What the fuck is you on?\" Fuck if I'm right\nFuck it, I'm on, you fucking at home\nWatching my ass, mad that I'm on\nOn my way to the top, and I'm coming along with one rolled\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nOne rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nOne rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]\nTry and hand me a joint, Burner\nMm-hmm...\nStarsky and Hutch minus the fuzz\nMild flat boys, hmh-hmh-hmh\nThat's what you wanna call us anyway\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign\nI travel across seas where women are gorgeous\nAnd niggas know it\u2019s us, we make it tough to mistake it\nJust let me roll one up and when it\u2019s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it\nThen we off to the races\n\n[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]\nStarsky and Hutch minus the fuzz\nMe and Spitta stick together like, huh\nCotton and mud, some chicks counting up buds\nMouth got cotton, prolly from the drugs\nLot of pot in my process, love\nDon't hate a nigga cause I'm blessed, judge me by my progress, bruh\nI obsess with every dollar I get\nFuck you think we made it out the projects for?\nThe object is to make money and get the most from it\nAnd more money, cause more money ain't enough of it\nI know niggas who had money and let it go to nothing\nJust blow money and ain't got nothing to show for it, that\u2019s fucking stupid\nSame as my diamonds and the fact I\u2019m buying all this new shit\nMade a million a way, a nigga grind\u2019ll be a blueprint\nI\u2019m talking champagne shit, Audemar tailor made shit\nLook at my jackets, say hand made bitch\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign\nI travel across seas where women are gorgeous\nAnd niggas know it\u2019s us, we make it tough to mistake it\nJust let me roll one up and when it\u2019s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it\nThen we off to the races\n\n[Verse 2: Curren$y]\nAnd I'm a pimp, see\nLeaning in my ride like how Bun B\nSitting tall on my chrome seat but I\u2019m low in the seat\nMy girl in the sheet fast asleep, I\u2019m in the street\nAfter the cheddar, peddling melodies, purchasing better things\nOn the road to the riches, I done drove over niggas\nMy nigga we major, we been major since independent\nMade it to what they saying, we made it but we ain't hearing it\nWe too busy getting it, hound dog sniffing it out\nTwisting a whole pound, celebrating the fact that\nThem wack fools had it but this here\u2019s the take back\nAnd them haters can\u2019t hate that\nSalute me from across a crowded club, homie, I take that as love\nReal nigga shit the only thing I\u2019m dealing with slim\nBitch you know that I\u2019m the reason that you still in this club\nGet out the corner of my eye and get in this truck\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is

to the races\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nYelling, \"Suck a dick or die hoe\"\nSee your main bitch is my side hoe\nSmoking top shelf on the top floor\nI\u2019m a boss bitch, I take my time and get it pronto\nYou probably fucking around\nDoing some shit I ain't got time for (pussy boy)\nFuck you and your whole anatomy bitch\nMy new crib look like an academy bitch\nIt\u2019s Finally Famous the faculty bitch\nKillin\u2019 these niggas, no casualties\nMoney and weed is a real nigga salary\nMan, these rappers sound like me\nAnd honestly that shit is so flattering bitch\n(Thank you, thank you, thank you) They want me to slip up and fall\nCrash, burn, but I just keep pissing them off (off)\nI got movies to make (make) I got women to call (call)\nI got deals on the table, I can\u2019t be dealing with y\u2019all, nigga\nRather crash parties and burn money (money)\nAnd if you pick the ashes up, you still can\u2019t earn from me (from me)\nBottom line is I never wait in line bitch\nAnd I\u2019m rolling King Kush, I\u2019m your Royal Highness\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is

Donato]\nWho trying to pour it(ay, ay)\nWho trying to wake and bake(ay)\nTaylor Gang will break the bank\nAin't got no time to contemplate\nI say i'm high from yesterday\nOkay i woke up on the mud\nI think i ate a 8th of shrums\nKeep OG Kush up in my lungs(whoa)\nYour hoe will come with us(ay)\nCause she know we brought the drugs(ay)\nAnd she looking for some love(ay)\nBut let's keep that on the hush(whoa)\nIt's hard to find some trust\nSome say it's hard to fuck with us\nThat's cause we be on different shit\nBitch i might pour six up in my Crush\nOhh that's super super much\nAnd this joint is super clutch\nGot 5 more just for you to stuff\nSend parents to the store for ice and cups\nI swear they never frighten us\nHell yeah we always lighting up\nPut that pussy on the plate it's fresh for lunch\nAnd i pour another 8th to level up\nProbably rolling up\n\n[Hook]\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWoke up drunk as fuck\nStill high from yesterday\nI'm trying to make a play\nI'm trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWoke up drunk as fuck\nStill high from yesterday\nI'm trying to make a play\nI'm trying to make a play"

I don't know\nJust look out for the next one\nBitch"

So what you got change?\nIt's all a perception\nSo what you do when all of it's gone?\nThey come for collection\nSo what you do when niggas you call just don't got connections?\nSo what you do?\nYou thought you was right, life taught you a lesson\nSo what you do when you got your word?\nYou make 'em respect it\nSo what you do?\nWhenever you wrong, you try to correct it\nSo what you do?\nWhen you down and out, you count up your blessings\nSo what you do?\nWhen you fuck around with feelings, don't catch 'em\nSo what you do?\nIf this one ain't right move, on to the next one\nSo what you do?\nIf you get the chance, you gon' be the best one\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nCountin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession (profession)\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nCountin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin' (blessin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm way too cool for these haters, way too high for my neighbors\nI'm way too hard on my job, I do it now and not later\nWay too cool for these niggas, I got too many flavors\nWay too wide on my mind, not smoke too many papers\nWay too out of the country, do anything I want\nWay too out of control, pull up anywhere and stunt\nI'm way too smooth for the police, now they act like they don't know me\nIt's way too clean to be stolen, Cartier and not the Rollie\nI'm way too real to be fake, too much love to feel hate\nYou way too tired to work, I get tired of waitin'\nI'm way too tall to ever think about doin' it small\nI'm way too into myself to even be fuckin' with y'all\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nCountin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession (profession)\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\nCountin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin' (blessin')\nI'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' (young to be stressin')\n\n[Outro: Ricky P]\nYe-ah\nIt's your driver Mr. Eazy Wider\nPicking you up in a brand spanking new Doober\nBrought to you by the Doober app\nMake sure you hit code 4/20 for 50% percent off\nAnd a pack of Khalifa cones for the ride y'all\nYou can smoke in this car\nAs long you rate your Doober driver before you leave\nAnd leave a tip too, bomb weed only\nDon't smoke no blunts in my Doober\nAnd see the joints, dabs, or bong rips, for the long trips"

I'm underage but far from underpaid\nI'm fresh to death, stay fly until I'm sleep off in a grave\nYou got them hoes you fuck with groupies that I used to know\nSay you gettin' money man, now money's what I choose to blow\nFinna pop some bottles, scream I'm through\nCame to shut the club down\nSo make some room, I'm...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow we in the club, hear the DJ scream my name\nHe shout out Heavy Hustle cause the DJ know my gang\nI'm standin' on the couch in V.I.P. I swing my chain\nThe DJ play my song, I throw my cheese and go insane\nAnd I got what they need, they come and shake it for a boss\nThese hoes just out here choosin' homie take it as a lost\nSweat comin' out my pores this Patron got me heated\nSecurity know what it is with me, I'm gettin' weeded\nThe hoes say I'm conceited. Niggas say I'm a fool\nMy chain is fuckin' freezey, this shit is kinda cool\nAnd I'm the kind of dude to walk behind your boo, tell her fuck ya man, I'm the man what you tryna' do\n\n[Hook]"

Well, shit\nI'm tryna give it all so I can get it back\nNow Taylor Gang that\n\n[Chorus: Sosamann]\nWhat I'm smokin' got me feelin'\nLike we ain't ever comin' down tonight\nAnd I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'\nThe Taylor way is how I live my life\nWhat I'm smokin' got me feelin'\nLike we ain't ever comin' down tonight\nAnd I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'\nThe Taylor way is how I live my life\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nSince the first turkey bag, we ain't never look back\nMy nigga said he'd get the hotel\nI said \"Nah, I'll sleep on the couch,\" and that was that\nWe here right on time, hater, relax\nRaw papers by the pack\nWakin' up neighbors\nWas on the road for a couple months so I stacked\nTaylor Gang, Jet Life, fill the walls up with plaques\nLeadin' by action, rollin' weed up in a classic\nRelaxin', leave the show with too much cash to spend\nGet back to the pad\nRemember days when niggas was doin' bad\nNow our girls look like they doin' ads\nWasn't into sports or too into class\nBut all my chains look like your phone flashin'\nNew estate, the gate automatic\n\n[Chorus: Sosamann]\nWhat I'm smokin' got me feelin'\nLike we ain't ever comin' down tonight\nAnd I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'\nThe Taylor way is how I live my life"

That's all patience and God's amazing\nSee what I came out of dawg? That should be motivation\nNow all I think about's broad chasing and car racing\nMoney so long, my arm shaking, the foreign banking\nI'm off the shore, flow so hot, I could spar with Satan\nI open doors with my voice so [?] my face is\nRollie mixed race, got a big face\nGotta get cake, brought a big plate\nPrada windbreak, thought I went late\nNow that Benz skate, down the interstate\nHow'd I get great? Not a mistake"

Make 'em remember us\nTen years plus, 10K's a new pair of rims for us\nCome and kick it with some niggas who don't empty guts\nThey broke so they envy us\nLaughin' to the bank while these suckers so serious\nYou ain't a boss, let me talk to your superior\nLeather interior, bet I don't marry her\nNew year, gearin' up for success in different areas\nNiggas was lost, switched the criteria\nHard not to stare at us\nThink she home, but she here with us\nGettin' that kush smoke in her hair and stuff\nThirty thousand feet in the air\nAlways been and will be prepared for any affair\nNo diamonds in my teeth but that's all I wear\nSolitaires by the pair, been ballin' my whole career\n\n[Chorus]\nBall 'til you fall\nDon't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all\nGotta stay hands on, heavily involved\nTry to handle your business and stay up out of ours\nThen your problem's solved\nBall 'til you fall\nDon't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all\nGotta stay hands on, heavily involved\nTry to handle your business and stay up out of ours\nThen your problem's solved"

And we been here for a minute\nThat explains all the trips I invested in\nIt's funny how all the fussing and fighting\nTurn around into us fucking and flying\nEvery night on the road you call me up and you crying\nWas worried about them bitches, now you too busy picking diamonds\nAin't worried bout a price\nCause if you want it I got it and I'mma pay for it\nThe good weed's lit, the champagne's poured\nOrder whatever you want if you got a taste for it\nIt's every girl's dream, but you awake for it\n[Hook] x4\nFly you to where I am\nI'll fly you!\n\n[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]\nAnd you, know how it goes I go harder than a bitch\nPardon my French, but I work hard for this\nYou never had to see me on no starving artist shit\nBut mama when you caught me cheating thought that you would call it quits\nKnew fuckin' with me that you was takin' all the risks\nSo you ain't trying to give in\nSaying I'll be straight and you'll be the one hurt in the end\nAnd that's no good!\nJust tryna put you in the game like a coach would\nEverything going just how it should, now your friends jealous\nThey hating on us. But we so far they can't tell us\nThe life we livin' it was made for us\nWhen you're ready, give me a call, I'll be waiting on it\nAll you gotta do is hit me when you land and I'll pick you up from the airport\nAnd take you straight to the villa we don't stay at resorts\n5-star suites, spend weeks at the day spa\nMama keep your day job, I'mma..\n\n[Hook] x4\nFly you to where I am\nI'll fly you!\n\n[Verse 3 - Wiz Khalifa]\nAnd no matter where we go, you\nSay you never been\nShe in love, cause I keep it G\nNot cause the Gs that I spend\nBut I DO spend Gs on expensive weed\nVintage sneaks and hotel room keys\nCame for a day, stayed the whole week\nRed-eye, no sleep - window seat\n\n[Hook] x4"

In the air you can't come up here\nNo bitch, only stunnas can come up here\nReal playas do what ever that they want here\nYou punks scared, rolling down the window gettin air\nReal niggas keep roaches in the ashtray\nI introduce you to the life up in the fast lane\nMoving quicker than Jamaicans at a track race\nI be babysitting don't forget to tell me pass mane\nNow break it down, roll it up\nBreak it down, roll it up\nCalliko, Wiz Khalifa, roll up\n\n[Hook]"

Im on the road she miss the ball\nAnd you thick for sure know how to work them hips right\nLevel with my swisher says i show her how to twist right\nAnd when i gotta make moves she keeps her lips tight\nTell her that the money stacked so she let me get right\nAnd that sex get good on them late nights\nNothin but thumbs up like a hitch hike\nYes im the shit like\nYou ain't never heard of\nAnd you know how i do\nAct like you dont but now i learn ya\nIm talking about teaching ya\nHow about schoolin ya\nGo and do your thang gimme brains, ill tutor ya\nSo many of them lames\nA real niggas somethin new to ya\nNow your tellin all your friends what i do to ya\nBut its cool ya know? I leave her spine broke\nWhen im up inside, make her breath and hit a high note\nLike...\n\n[Interlude: Kev da Hustla talking]\nYeah, so I'm standin on the corner\nShorty ride through. She pushed the whip like ya know?\nMe and my nigga Wiz...blowing on that good I'm like...\nWe gotta stop shawty. See jump out....\n\n[Verse 2: Kev da Hustla]:\nAnd now i approach her\nLike whats your name\nYou get the picture shorty i really like your frame\nThat coke bottle shape and them asian eyes\nYour half black and half you ain't gotta tell the guys\nShit wonder why i approached her\nI wanna get to know ya but i ain't tryin to hold you\nBack from all your dreams and high hopes\nYou smell that mami\nYeah thats real smoke\nListen i got plans too\nYou know how your man do\nIll get close before i try to cuff hands boo\nYour for your latest shidd\nYeah thats my favorite\nRoom lit like vegas\nHe point like \"pay them\"\nMami ya body amazing\nLights off no cable\nI found out she a mind freak like chris angels\nBendin over tables, giving her all she handles\nI swear to god her room sounded like this damn sample\n\n[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa talking]\nYesss, I seen my man Kev The Hustla over there on somethin bad\nI mean bad. So i mean, i finish rollin up my weed\nHop out the car, i see a couple of little ones\nOver there lookin kind of lonely ya kno\nIm sayin not preferably one, she looking at me\nI seen her smilin and all that\nLike she know who a nigga is\nSo you know what i do, i walk straight up to her like...\n\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]\nEy ey shorty i just wanna talk to ya\nUsually keep it moving but i had to stop for ya\nAnd let you know any thing less than me is not for ya\nNo time to waste i got patience like a doctor do\nAnd this may be a lot for you\nSo why dont you fall in\nHit some of this weed and soak it all in\nGot game like the ball in\nAnd we ballin goin state to state call me rawlings\nLook dawg i ain't tryna start nothing\nShe laughed and said that you kinda star or somethin\nIm like nah im playin with you ma i'm frontin\nThey call me young wiz\nGet up in my car or somethin\nWe could talk about your day why im cigar stuffin\nHeres my phone give me a number that i can call or something\nGet you back to your crib and have the walls jumpin\nScreamin at the top of your lungs like...."

Y'all convinced 'em\nThe hate in the equation just a small addition\nMy name Wiz Khalifa, but just call me mister...\n4, 1, 2\n\n[Hook]\nAnd if you fuck with me, grow"

Keep it real with me\nTry to chill with me, why you still with me?\n\n[Bridge]\nWe both know we got our own thing goin' on\nWe both know we got our own thing goin' on\nWe both know when we link up, we stay 'til the morning\nWe both know when we link up, we stay 'til the morning\n\n[Chorus]\nYou stay on my mind, you stay on my mind\nI try to shake you, but you stay on my mind\nYou stay on my mind, you stay on my mind\nI try to shake you, but you stay on my mind\nYou stay on my mind, you stay on my mind\nI try to shake you, but you stay on my mind\nYou stay on my mind, you stay on my mind\nI try to shake you, but you stay on my mind"
