  "plain": "Brandon Paak Anderson, a.k.a. Anderson .Paak, is a singer, songwriter, producer, and drummer from Oxnard, California. He released his debut EP, Violets Are Blue, under his original moniker, Breezy Lovejoy, in 2010. He eventually began using his new stage name and released  O.B.E. Vol. 1 in June 2012 and Lovejoy in October 2012.\n\nBefore his 2014 album Venice, .Paak officially changed his name to Anderson .Paak. When asked if his name change was symbolic of a turning point in his career by Consequence of Sound, he stated:\n\nYeah, that was the case. [\u2026] and I felt like it was time to transition to a different name.\n\nWith his name change, .Paak was reborn. Venice, released a full two years after his last project showcased .Paak\u2019s incredible versatility. \u201cMilk n' Honey\u201d showed .Paak\u2019s storytelling ability. In \u201cThe City,\u201d .Paak shows he can create a West Coast anthem. \u201cDrugs,\u201d the single that got .Paak noticed by Dre, is perhaps .Paak\u2019s most telling song of his sound, with powerful vocals and progressive production on full display.\n\n2015 was a standout year for .Paak, thanks to his guest features. Appearing on six songs from Dr. Dre\u2019s Compton project, as well as two songs on The Game\u2019s The Documentary 2.5, his popularity began to skyrocket. In late 2015, .Paak released two EP\u2019s: The Anderson .Paak EP in collaboration with The Blended Babies and Link Up & Suede as one half of NxWorries with producer Knxwledge.\n\nRiding the success of 2015, 2016 saw .Paak collaborate with many big name artists. Anderson was featured on Macklemore\u2019s \u201cDance Off\u201d, Domo Genesis' \u201cDapper\u201d, KAYTRANDA\u2019s \u201cGlowed Up,\u201d Snakehips \u201cMoney On Me\u201d, ScHoolboy Q\u2019s \u201cBlank Face\u201d, and Mac Miller\u2019s \u201cDang!\u201d.\n\nIn January of 2016, .Paak released his second album, Malibu. The album, sixteen tracks in length, is .Paak\u2019s strongest work to date, showing the growth he\u2019s made since his Breezy Lovejoy days. The album was met with incredible praise, receiving an 85 on Metacritic, making it one of the most well-received albums of the year.\n\nAfter the release of Malibu, .Paak announced that he signed to Dr. Dre\u2019s Aftermath Entertainment. Paak was also a member of 2016\u2019s XXL Freshman Issue.\n\nHe released his third studio album, Oxnard, on November 16, 2018. He would release two singles prior to the project: \u201cTints\u201d, featuring Kendrick Lamar, and \u201cWho R U?\u201d, produced in part by Dr. Dre. The album was received well by critics, and debuted at #11 on the Billboard 200. The song \u201cBubblin\u201d won \u201cBest Rap Performance\u201d at the 61st Grammy Awards on May 17, 2019.\n\nOn April 12, 2019, he released his fourth studio album, Ventura. The star-studded project features such artists as Andr\u00e9 3000, Smokey Robinson, Lalah Hathaway, and more. Ventura would become Paak\u2019s first US Top Ten hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard 200."

Cole]\nCame down the block, somethin' sick, but it's rented\nI don't give a fuck, bitch, either way, I'm in it\nI ain't gotta prove to you that I got bread\nNiggas talkin' money but be broker than the bed\nThat I slept on back in Mohammed crib\n'Member fuckin' hoes leanin' all to the left?\nDon't know why they rock wit' a nigga, but they did\nDamn sure wasn't the money, maybe it's the kid?\nUsed to have a honey that I loved when we was younger but somehow got disconnected before Facebook got so big\nI used to search her name hopin' we could reconnect\nBut if I sent the message, would she still be on my dick?\nWhen I couldn't find her, had me feelin' mad lame\nMaybe she got married and she changed her last name\nMaybe she just ain't up on the latest of the internet and ain't got into that\nBut give her time, that'll change\nBingo, what do you know?\nYears later (Right), late night after a show we here laid up (Right)\nBrown skin, love how it glow, your hair tied up (Right)\nAsk, \"Is it cool if I smoke?\" Go 'head, light up (Right)\nHigh from your fragrance, I love, you smell purrty (Smells good)\nKnow I got it straight from the mud, my nails dirty (Right)\nIf somehow we both lose touch, I won't lie, ya got me open way too much, I'm gon' find ya\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nSweet trippy, you\u2019re lost in the deep end, like water to a fish scale\nLove to watch you swim\nI can't get rid of you, all the places that I used to go and kick it\nAll this weight that I'm liftin', trippy\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nCome meet me in the middle, right there where you always be\nSomewhere in between, you and I will always meet\nCome meet me in the middle, right there where we always be\nSomewhere in between, you and I will always meet\nCome meet me in the middle (You and I will always be)\nCome meet me in the middle (Somewhere in between)\nCome meet me in the middle (You and I will always meet)\nSomewhere in between\nYou and I will always be"

It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield\nMore like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale\nWord to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?\nWho would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?\nYeah, this is the music that you gotta feel\nYeah, gave you the truth before I got a deal\nNo rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield\nMore like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale\nWord to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?\nWho would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nUsed to be scared of all my fears\nTill I woke up from this nightmare\nNow what become of a dream deferred, now until we leave this earth\nThe music make your speakers burst, I always put my people first\nIt's deep how when I speak they say I'm preaching like I lead a church\nNo proper opposition, competition gonna need a nurse\nMy job as an artist is making miracles\nTo show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical\nCrystallize the thought to make it clear to you\nAnd make the revolution irresistable\n\n[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak]\nThis one's for all the little dreamers\nAnd the ones who never gave a fuck\nI'm a product of the tube and the free lunch\nLiving room, watching old reruns\nAnd who cares your daddy couldn't be here?\nMama always kept the cable on\nI'm a product of the tube and the free lunch\nLiving room, watching old reruns\n\n[Interlude: Timan Family Choir]\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\n\n[Outro]\nOh my gosh guys calm down\nStop it\n\n[Skit]\nNow evolution: Where it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning\nThere was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history\nAnd I doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again\nDue to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy\nBut there are other areas which are magnificent, treasures of this world\nAnd for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure\nThey can find this way of living"

What can we do?\n\n[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]\nI want you by my lonesome, above this crowded space\nIt's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way\nWell if no one's in the running for the part\nI'd love to pick a day\nTo show you the main room (Whenever's a good time)\nI don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space\nHomie three blocks away, I got bottles for days\nI got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye\nLet me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm\nTell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nCause baby there's room in here\nJust enough for two in here\nAin't nobody but you and me in here\nYeah, what can we do in here?\nWhat can we do?

Yeah\nYeah, we had fun, if only for the time being\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\n[Breakdown]\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nRide, I'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\n[Breakdown]\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nRide, I'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride"

Fuck what you say\nDon't do me no favors, let's get back to basics\nWe live for today, bitch, fuck up out my way, bitch\nI'm losin' all my aces, I'm runnin' outta patience\nGot some pretty faces knowin' what my name is\nUp in high places, I got some new neighbors\nThey don't really say shit but when they see the spaceship\nThey just think I rap or some form of entertainment\nBut they don't know I'm black, young, gifted and amazin'\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nYou know I had to close my eyes, yeah\nAnd if I have to free my mind\nI may not have the lane, movin' all along\nKnowin' that I can't do it on my own\nAnd if I got the pain feelin' comin' out\nHave to run away, think I'm goin' home\n\n[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]\nYeah, you know I'm workin' on a world premiere\nAnd I could see the world from here\nI know you somewhere in the atmosphere\nI know someday I'll meet you halfway there (Cheers)\nThey say there's nothin' you can do about it\nCan't say that I'm new to sorrow\nWishin' I could take your problems\nTrade 'em for a little more time wit'chu\nCarry you out the bottom, the weight of the world, I got it\nSprouted wit'chu on my shoulder, the greatest honor to know ya\nI'd gotta be honest wit'cha, I hate you ain't in the picture\nI hate all them fake niggas claimin' like they gon' really miss ya\nI know there's no one to blame and maybe the point that I'm missin'\nBut I needed a minute, just give me a minute\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nYou know I had to close my eyes, yeah\nAnd if I have to free my mind\nI may not have the lane, movin' all along\nKnowin' that I can't do it on my own\nAnd if I got the pain feelin' comin' out\nHave to run away, think I'm goin' home\n\n[Break: Anderson .Paak]\nOh, say it ain't so!\nTears keep fallin' down my eyes\nDamn it, I miss you, I should be with you\nCan't turn back the hands of time but I should be with you\nI miss my friend\nDamn it, I miss you\nCannot bring you back\n\n[Verse 3: Q-Tip]\nThese pictures I'm seein' are fuckin' me up\nAnd I don't know what to do but reminisce and face the pain\nBack in the day before you were a dog and you were just pup\nBangin' beats and bringin' bitches back to the tour bus\nExcuse me, y'all, I know this .Paak shit, I just need a second\nIt's Q-Tip in this bitch and I'm just in here reflectin'\nHead on collisions with memories in the intersection\nLookin' in my rearview, wishin' I could be near you\nThe freeways of my mind are crowded with traffic\nThe good times that we had and them bad habits\nLook at me now, look around, last man standin'\nGrown man cryin' like a child tryna understand it\nSo sick of sendin' flowers to all of my brother's mommas\nDon't know what's harder, fightin' trauma or keepin' a promise\nA true confession breath is a blessin', without a question\nBut niggas don't get the message until they get disconnected\nMy story ain't over, I'm still turnin' pages\nBut the picture I painted with you in it has faded\nMy queen, my dreams and even my wages\nI know what it means to lose everything when you made it\nRags to the riches and back to the rags is a muh'fucka\nThe consequence of puttin' all your chips in one bucket\nTo be honest, I feel like gettin' right back to these commas\nYou motherfuckers keep the drama\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nI'm workin' on a world premiere\nAnd I could see the world from here\nI know there must be somethin' after here\nI know some day I'll meet ya halfway there in the atmosphere\nCheers\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nFree my mind\nYou know I had to close my eyes\nClose my eyes\nYou know I have to free my mind\nOooooh\nYou know I had to close my eyes\nYou know it's time for me...\nYou know I have to free my mind\n\n[Outro]\nFree my...\nFree\nFree\nFree my...\n...My mind\nMy mind\nMy Mind"

Now let me ask you this question)\nWhy you pickin' on me?\nShut up and sit down! I told you to sit down!\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nDon't use it all at once\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\nDon't use it, timing is all we got\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\n\n[Verse: Anderson .Paak]\nOh, hell no\nI had to get back for the candy, uh\nI flew for an hour then landed, oh\nShe live on a beautiful campus, oh\nShe dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes\nKnow what she want and she know I ain't shit but a savage, ooh\nShe soaking up game\nHer brain is a series of pamphlets, wow\nShe told me a story as long as her lashes\nOh what a hopeless romantic\nFucking with jokers and addicts\nShe told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit\nI said, 'Baby girl, you ain't even old enough to be jaded'\nAnd wow, she want visual stimulation\nShort attention span and little patience\nI like Hennessy and record players\nTeddy Pendergrass and Sammy Davis\nOpposites attract. I swear, we a magnet\nDon't be fucking up your scholarship\nI can't help you with grants\nWord to my father, my word and my balls is 'bout all that I honor\nAs God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nDon't use it all at once\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\n(Do what you want, what you want, as long as you jump in the bed)\nI only want to do what feels right\nI have to be gone before the midterms\nYou making up your mind, you're out of songs aren't you?\nI wanted an encore, more tunes\n\n[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]\nHey, come back to bed\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nDon't use it all at once\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\nTiming is all we got\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long"

I had my three when I was sixteen\nThat happens, what are you gonna do?\nMaybe she's your first great one\nThanks a lot, Sonny\nI think I'm gonna go for one\n\n[Verse 1]\nThis is not some super conventional\nExtra slick talk meant to convince you all\nMaster classes reduced to simple form\nThere's nothing formulaic about it\nThis, more that\nPapa told you only open the door if he opens it first for you\nMama, sit down, help me get through\nIs this how you felt on the day you found it?\n\n[Chorus]\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is not some take you out for lunch\nWine and dine you and cha you on counter tops\nFill your mind with cotton candy hearts\nWhat's the odds you stay a while?\nThis, more that\nGet to know me, kiss me slowly, hard to focus\nThey just don't make 'em like this no more, whoa\nBut I think I've found it\n\n[Chorus]\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\n\n[Break]\nCha, cha-cha-cha\nBah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah\nBah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, ooh\nBah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah\n\n[Bridge]\nSomebody go (Somebody go)\nSomebody go (Somebody go)\nSomebody go get me\nI'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)\nI'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)\nI'm 'bout to go in deep\nThat's not what I thought it was\nBut it's more than I bargained for\nSomebody go (Somebody go)\nSomebody go get me sober\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah\nThey gon' have to come for me\nCame out my comfort zone to be amidst your company\nSomethin' about the way you never gave it up to me\nBut let me know that I can get it  any day of the week\nIf talk is cheap, well then, I'm broke\nWith both hands on the sweeper, cleanin' up dirty secrets\nTold you don't ever give me that gushy, but I didn't mean it\nBring her home and I'ma bust it out the residence\nWhen I get the gushy, I go dumb like the President\nYes, lawd, I'm way up, word to Sacagawea\nIf the gushy was a sneaker, it'd be moccasin trainer\nIf the gushy wasn't so sweet, I could save it for later\nBut every time I fuck with someone else, I wish you was there\nKinda douchey I know, how the fuck I get here\nI got hoes, I got hoes, we don't need to go there\nOn my way out a zone, somebody gon' give me body\nPick my feet off the floor, boy, I think I'm fallin'\n\n[Chorus]\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool"

(Woo)\nDestroy and rebuild niggas\nThat's the only way to build nigga, yuugh\nDefinition of a real nigga\nAnd the target, it ain't to kill niggas, no\nAm I my brother's keeper? I'm dialing in a bit deeper\nArm's reach of the reaper, they say it's cheaper to keep her\nLife's a bitch\n\n[Outro: Anderson .Paak]\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nI'm running through changes, is it strange\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nTo be baited, shit I'm grown\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nBut still a fade\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nShootin' off with no marks\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nIf I hit, there's no mistakes, yeah\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nHuh, baby\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nI'm running through changes, daily\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nEvery day, ohh, ohh now\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nI'm running through changes\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nThrough change\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nEvery day\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nWill it stay\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nI'm running through changes\n(How I ever, ever let you go)\nWill it change\n(How I ever, ever let you go)"

(Yeah, what can we do?)\nWhat can we do? (What can we do, baby?)\nWhat can we do? (Hey, what can we do?)\nWhat can we do? (Do)\n\n[Verse 2: Nate Dogg, Anderson .Paak & Both]\nThat's when the change comes\nThat's when the game's done\nThat's when the walls come tumbling down\nAh, ah, ah, yeah\nThey see me gettin' action\nStarted, it ain't no fun\nTime to grow up and turn it around\nAh, ah, ah, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Anderson .Paak]\nHey, what can we do?

Just open your eyes\nThis is life as you know it\nA few make it through, most won't survive\nA penny with a hole with no hope inside\nIt's survival of the finesse\nAnd my nigga's went to dinners\nSo we taking a bite\nAnd I made up my mind\nThe whole world loves you when you're top of the line\nThe hoes gon' want you when you're thuggin' it right\nBut the feds gon' bust you if your money too husky man\nTrust me, devils want you livin' in fright\nAin't that right?"

Lately I been wonderin'\nGo to hell or get a job? Fuck you niggas buggin'\nI was meant to beat the odds, somethin' out of nothin'\nYou afraid to take a loss, I lost my older brother\nSister, father, auntie, cousin, I got nothin' left but y'all\nHockin' rubies from the jaw it's just another jewel bitch\nNow I got the sauce, okay now I got the juice, hey, hey\nI repped the 'Nard, even when you never knew it\nMy first release party, twelve niggas came through it\nFirst I got a lawyer, moved momma to Georgia\nCopped my sis a Honda, talk about spoiled\nIf I can't get radio I'm snatchin' up the products\nApple, Google, Amazon, Spoti-\nShouts out to Justin, shouts out to Sour\nIf I go commercial they gon' run me every hour (Every hour)\nOkay, you gon' run me every hour? (Every hour)\nOkay, you gon' run me every hour? (Facts)\nFirst I had my heart broke, then I had my heart meant\nThen I had a heart to heart with my conscious\nRest in peace to Mac, wish you was alive still\nAnd if we get to meet I'ma roll you up some ganja\nI'ma roll you up some ganja\nI 'preciate it man, look\nThat XXL freestyle was kinda ass\nSo I couldn't hit the Leakers without spittin' straight gas\nAnd I'm on a warpath and I brought my team back\nShout out to Aftermath, 12 Tone and Free Nash"

Goddamn lie\n\n[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]\nOh my\nTime heals all, but you out of time now (Now)\nJudge gotta watch us from the clock tower (True)\nLil' tear gas cleared the whole place out\nI'll be back with the hazmat for the next round\nWe was tryna protest, then the fires broke out\nLook out for the secret agents, they be planted in the crowd\nSaid, \"It's civil unrest,\" but you sleep so sound\nLike you don't hear the screams when we catchin' beatdowns?\nStayin' quiet when they killin' niggas, but you speak loud\nWhen we riot, got opinions comin' from a place of privilege\nSicker than the COVID how they did him on the ground\nSpeakin' of the COVID, is it still goin' around?\nAnd won't you tell me 'bout the lootin'? What's that really all about?\n'Cause they throw away black lives like paper towels\nPlus unemployment rate, what, forty million now?\nKilled a man in broad day, might never see a trial\nWe just wanna break chains like slaves in the South\nStarted in the North End but we in the downtown\nRiot cops tried to block, now we got a showdown\n(Citizens of Los Angeles) Down\n(I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly)\n(And in the name of the people of the State of California)\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nYou should've been downtown (Command all those assembled)\nThe people are risin' (Right here)\nWe thought it was a lockdown\nThey opened the fire (Ooh)\nThem bullets was flyin'\n(Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop because they tell us to)\nWho said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Rock]\nTurn on your tube dawg, look how they do us\nKnee on our necks, bullets in backs\nStimulus checks strictly for blacks?\nHistory repeatin', people scared to eat a chicken\nEverybody goin' vegan, what they put in it?\nLook at the world we livin' in, they got it shook\nAnd then you go on your jog, then your color might get you took\nAnd yet the man in the mirror, can\u2019t look away, you gotta look at it\nBlack Lives Matter, so what it means when they shoot at it?\nGeneration, genocide, what happened to enterprise?\nHeard the man infiltrated, Black Panther, re-energize\nAin\u2019t nothin' to figure out, they tryna kill us out\nIf I take a kneel, see my fist? I\u2019m a killer now\nJust think, bullshit, you gotta filter out\nAre you really ready for the smoke like a Swisher house?\nReady for the revolution, who ready to ride? It won\u2019t be televised\nSo tell me, who ready to die? If downtown goin' up\nWhere we at with the shits? We at the liquor store, nigga\n\u2018Bout to get us a fifth, know they 'bout to start lootin\u2019\nGrab the gloves and masks, watch out for them tanks\nWhen they rollin' past, yeah, ahaha\n\n[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]\nUh, okay\nNever understand why they do it\nSomeone cut the channel off the news 'fore I lose it (Nah)\nI ain't even trippin', if you wit' it, then we lootin' (Nah)\nHelp me put this Louis in the back of Suzuki (Ooh), o-he\nHad to break it down so smoothly (Smooth)\nThey gon' say, \"It's not about race,\" but we movin' (Fuckin') ho, power\nCopped the tre pound, had to put that in my name\nWish a nigga play now (Yeah)\nAny given day, I'll be headed to the pulpits (Yeah)\nSay a lil' prayer, matter fact, I need two of 'em, ooh\nWon't he do it? Won't he do it?\nOoh, this ain't '92 so we into new rules\nNiggas got hip, so we don't loot the projects\n'Bout to hit Rodeo with my lil' cousin Marcus\nSomeone threw a whole brick in the Neiman Marcus (Ah)\nHelp me put the whole mannequin in the Charger\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nYou should've been downtown (Down)\nThe people are risin' (Look around)\nWe thought it was a lockdown (Lockdown)\nThey opened the fire (Had to get low, fire)\nThem bullets was flyin' (Down, down)\nWho said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (Ooh-wee)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nLockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to\nDowntown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet\nTre pound (Uh), got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it\nLockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to\nDowntown\n\n[Instrumental Outro]"

What's that really all about?\n'Cause they throw away black lives like paper towels\nPlus unemployment rate, what, forty million now?\nKilled a man in broad day, might never see a trial\nWe just wanna break chains like slaves in the South\nStarted in the North End but we in the downtown\nRiot cops tried to block, now we got a showdown\n(Citizens of Los Angeles) Down\n(I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly)\n(And in the name of the people of the State of California)\n\n[Chorus]\nYou should've been downtown (Command all those assembled)\nThe people are risin' (Right here)\nWe thought it was a lockdown\nThey opened the fire (Ooh)\nThem bullets was flyin'\n(Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop because they tell us to)\nWho said it was a lockdown?

I said let's slow it down\nOnly now do I realize that it's over\nCalling like a crazy ex, I need to stop, wait a sec\nGive her room to breathe. five feet. please, baby\nIs it my ego? tell me, people, cause I ain't sure\nIs it cause she broke my heart before I got to break hers\nI'm a selfish man wanting what I can't have\nWe had a ball, but I gotta have the last dance\nI just stay cool, trying for us to coexist\nSaying this song ain't about you, but you know it is\nI'm not trying to be rude, I'm doing what I'm supposed to do\nHope these sunny days, giving me thoughts of you\nAll I know, baby All I know\nYou're the one I love, the only one I love"
