  "plain": "Newark, New Jersey\u2019s Reggie Noble is better known as Redman, a rapper, producer and DJ who got his big break working with EPMD. Funk Doctor Spock has gone on to produce his own classic albums and star in television shows and movies.\n\nIn the November 14, 1992 issue of Billboard magazine, Redman explained how he got his name:\n\nA snowball hit me on the cheek when I was 11 [\u2026] My face got real red. And everybody started calling me Redman.\n\nRedman made his first appearances on wax in 1990 with the songs \u201cBrothers On My Jock\u201d and \u201cHardcore\u201d from EPMD\u2019s 1990 album Business As Usual. He also provided a show-stealing verse on their 1992 track \u201cHead Banger\u201d a few months before releasing his critically acclaimed debut album, Whut? Thee Album, with the assistance of Erick Sermon. His next three albums\u2014Dare Iz a Darkside (1994), Muddy Waters (1996), and Doc\u2019s da Name 2000\u2014also received praise from critics and fans. In 1998, he connected with his Def Squad associates Erick Sermon and Keith Murray to release the album El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nIn 1995, Redman began his working relationship with his partner-in-rhyme Method Man with their collaboration \u201cHow High\u201d from The Show soundtrack. They went on to release two albums as a duo (Blackout! in 1999 and Blackout! 2 in 2009) as well as star in the film How High in 2001 and the short-lived FOX sitcom Method & Red in 2004.\n\nRedman also made multiple appearances in the NBA 2K and Def Jam fighting video games, as well as Seed of Chucky, Chappelle\u2019s Show, Scary Movie 3, and a memorable showing on MTV Cribs."

The fool who visit the playground\nWith two biscuits to lay down the school district\nGet pistol-whipped with a Mossberg\nWith a pistol grip, and fed pitbull shits\nSniff glue sticks like I give two shits (Yeah!)\nIf I get too rich, I just get sued\n\n[Verse 2: Redman & Eminem]\nYo, I leave wit no injure, after I blow four in ya\nOne handstand on top of yo ninja\nCrash it, Doc stir the madness\n'Til y'all outta work like Tony Atlas\nWalkin', cans in the laundry basket\nAmerica's Most, with the army after us\nFuck flossin', we take what's yours\nUnload fifteen like an ace and four\nI'm outta work, but Doc laid them off\n(Shit, the power's out) The tape is off!\nYo, you targeted from arsonists\nPapermate pens filled wit arsenic\nI got hoes that don't know what Prada is\nDoc could shape up, touch your barber, miss (Ts!

You fuckin' bitch, suck a dick and two balls! (Hahaha)\nI'm givin' you all my job descrip', which is\nTo piss bitches and priests off with this (\"...Need Jesus!\")\nPop more pills 'til police officers\nArrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim\nTeeth off my dick, hands off my balls\nBut y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all!

Look out, it's the Funkadelic Funk for chumps\nWho don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks\nI make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip\nI get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik\nThe top notch of the block, 'cause I carry a Glock\nHoly hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props\nMy style is HUMMIN CUMMIN ATCHA, duck or get backed up\nDispatcher: 'Red, get freaky to the rapture'\nSo come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her\nThe Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off\nThen hook off on your crew, to the checka one, two\nIt's you, who? (AGA-AHHH! WWAAAAAH!) Redman with the Kung-Fu\nCome on and get down and boogie oogie with the ruffneck\nHit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette\nBut first get your tables I roast your whole record label, kids\nYo E (Whassup, G?)

Nah Duke, forget it\nI rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks\nThe rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock\nSit back relax let me rip to the funk track\nAnd press rewind if I haven't blown your mind\n(\"REE-WIND!!\")\n\n[Hook]\n\"You blow my mind, baby\" \"I'll toast to that\"\n\"You blow my mind, baby\"\nPress rewind if I haven't blown your mind\n\"You blow my mind, baby\" \"I'll toast to that\"\n\"You blow my mind, baby\"\nPress rewind if I\u2014HA-UHH...\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet me get busy with the funky fly stuff\n'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out\nFuck Bruce Willis because I die rough\nIt's the Funkadelic Redman and I hit ya with the\nFunkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil\nThe spectular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula\nLoaded, of course, more Legend than Acura\nI'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket\nPlus keep the Glock in my basket\nI cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue\n'Cause I can 'Wax on!

Uhh\nThat's my nine in you; feelin' nauseous? That's my rhyme in you\nI swing funk like nunchucks, my game's death\nThat's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul\nHot like Worchestire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech\nMy funk speech make words wear sun visors\nI'm gettin' down with the funk in your trunk\nDef Squad's in the house for *95* for all you punks\n\n[Sampled Hook: Q-Tip]\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\n\n[Verse 2]\nAhhh, I'm just as high as three pilled up motherfuckers\nDef Squad's in the house for *95* you suckers\nPunks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once, twice\nI'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight\nThe top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped\nI'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amnesia\nI'm swifter than roller blades on Ice Capades\nI'm Fearless like Four plus I'm Kool like Aid\nMy grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama\nI never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters\nMy style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef\nDef like Jam or Squad, or Def like Lep\nOne, two! Big up to my niggas on one-deuce\nThat cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in *blue*\nRrrrrah! With weed for you!\nWho says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes?\nI cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up\nYou better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers\n'Cause Redman will bomb just like Saddam\nWhen I'm loose I'm worldwide like Triple F.A.T. Goose\nHeavily armed\n\n[Hook: Q-Tip]\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk"

That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill\nFrom a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill\nJust because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit\nWhat's the flavor, Tame? (Fuck what you heard, this rated R)\n\n[Chorus: Repeat 4X]\n\"I'm rated R, this is a warning\"\n\"Boy you can't fuck with me!!\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack to part two of the segment, the Red bend\nMics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends\nAnd if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk\nAnd tell the devil I'll be in time for lunch (heh heh heh heh)\nGot Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P\nThe best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!\nPsych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women\n'Cause the pretty one's puss' smell like they went fishin\nI grab my dick with a tight grip 'cause I might flip\n(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)\nI had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck\nTried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with an uppercut (BING!)\nSnapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it\n'Cause it was August and he was talkin this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)\nJason my man slangs rocks like up the block\n143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop\nNorman Bates work the night shift late\nSince he dresses like his mama, I pimp him and his hoecake\nBust a maneuver, Freddy Krueger\nDreamed about me havin' him scooped up\nHe woke up with his dukes up\nThat caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw\nPlus I got his brain pickled in a jar\nSo let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate\nMy rap style, so to cut 'em off, I truncate\nAnd rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up\nWith the one-two punch, like serving a customer\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nThen ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\nI know, from me, THE original P-Funk\nSee ya next LP, chump!\n\n[Chorus: Repeat 4X]\n\"I'm rated R, this is a warning\"\n\"Boy you can't fuck with me!!\""

can't stand it, and you'll need Teddy to unjam it when I cram it\nI'm from, N to the E, W-A-R-K\nNewark NJ got the AK, when I wave bitch you better say \"Heey!\"\nI'm a Kid From the Hall\nI got big balls to make your pussy walls drip in your lace drawers\nHey boy this is the way the East Coast swing it so bring it\nMan, I turn your ass Brown-er than James with the Sex Machine shit\nI keep the chronic patrol on the road\nIn case you're wondering why I keep mad izm\n'Cause I smoke everybody else's shit up\nMy style's the ultimate funk when I mic checka, one two checka\nAnd I give effects to niggas with my Black and Decker, so check\nThe manuscript, man you flipped, put it down if you can't handle it\nGot a B.R.C.G., Blunt Rollers College Graduate\nI got a degrees in Physics on how high I can get\nThen next I check how many niggas that can die from my TEC\nCause the N-E-W-A-R-K\nIs where the niggas robbin' and stealin' and buckin' niggas every day\nNow Jersey's on max so pass the dutchie on the left hand side\nGot the hidash, in case we cridash, in my ride\nSo, sliiiide, before I call the medics\nYou can bet, bitch, you couldn't get fly if you was FedEx\nCan I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya?\nStrong as ammonia, smell it from here to California\n'Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco\nI'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho\nMy music more underground than a kid at 300 XL\nConvertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected\nI'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz\nAnd chumps are wondering what two niggas dropped the funk, funk!\n\n[Chorus]\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)\nWho is them niggas, who is them niggas\nWho is dem niggas Redman and Reggie Noble\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

emergency 'cause Reggie Noble known like burglary\nI get hot busted when I dip my nuggets (Hey)\n'Cause it take a million niggas to stop it just like Chuck did\n'Cause we run around Newark with the nine on cock\nKeep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block\nAnd if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter\nSo go show you more nigga events than Jacob Javits center\nI'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines\nCops, I got the hot Glock stocked for when it's playtime\nI rock around the Robin tweet tweet on the calendar\n'Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra\nI make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester\n'Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of asbestos\nSo check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast\n'Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justice\nHold tight, hold tight, everybody hold tight\nI'm Super like my man Cat, 'cause I keep my styles jam packed\nI (wreawow) like Anthrax, split my pants like Bill Bixby\nYou could tell the tracks was fat from the work of my MP-60\nI smoke the chronic that's why my sinus always fucked up\n(Cam-boo, cam-boo cam-boo) Will have you fucked up\nI blaze blunts with my nigga Mel-low, yo, say hello\n(Yo, what up dog?)\nReally, now pass the second blunt to Quilly\n\n[Uncle Quilly]\nNow sit your big ass down 'cause I don't know about this rap stuff\nThere wasn't rap when I was pickin' cotton, saying 'massa'\nY'all young whippersnappers, with the caps on backwards\nMan, y'all fuck around with Quilly I kick a bone out yo' ass quick\n(Watch out now) I ain't bullshittin'\nI represent the O-O-O-O-OG's from '43 goddamnit\nAnd if you keep on with that dirty mistreating\nI'm gon' whoop your ass 'til your heart stop beating goddamnit\n\n[Verse 3: Redman]\nAyo, chronic bubonic, the funky bionic you find it I'll have to rewind it\nWhere minds are blinded, \"Time 4 Sum Aksion\", so time to find it\nI'm smoked out like a cookout, ah, look out, my dick's out\nThat was last album when I was bouncing on trains like Malcolm\nI was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive\nThat's why I quit my nine to five and got live\nBecause this \"hip to the hop\" shit fills my pockets\nAnd I'm Audi for '94 because I already got my props\nHoes, hoes, and more hoes...\n\n[Outro: Redman & (*Reggie Noble*)]\nNah nah nah nah

Attention to all you punk motherfuckers out there\n(uh-huh uh-huh, check it out, check it out)\nFunky Noble Productions represent for the nine-four and nine-five area\nReggie Noble and Rockwilder in the house for the nizzow\nIf you don't know you might as well close your mizzouth\n(To my peeps in Queens)\nYeah, ohh shit, yo, it's a bird\n(Nah I thought that shit was a fuckin plane dude)\nNah nah nah, it's Soop, Soop, Soop-a-man\n[It's on!]\nHah\n\nVerse One: Redman\n\nWell it's the Soopaman Lovah in your motherfuckin town\nGet down go round and round like shocks on your G-spot\nHoneydip, now all of y'all up in that funny shit\nBut I ain't switched, still a honeydip is a honeybitch\nIn the mix! So bitches be lookin fly and I'll run in em\nWith they toes and nails done, hair wrapped up with pins in em\nFifty-four eleven Reeboks bitch which you need not\nTo do is get fly, cause where I'm from, bitches get speed knots\nSlow your monkey ass down and hold your horses\nDon't wanna know your name don't wanna know none of your sources\nJust fix me, with a quickie, I swear more Lake's than Ricki\nSo bad I use my X-Ray vision to give y'all clits a hickie\nAnd plus the weed I puff is from the planet of Cheech and Chong\nWhere the earth is chronic, and How To Roll a Blunt is the theme song\nOooh you makin me horny! Well uhh, let me wipe that wetness for ya\nSlurped and burped, got that bitch more open than my door do\nLet's take a journey up in the stars where I live at\nWhere I fuck Jane, Judy Jetson, and that robot bitch-ah\nGrab onto the cape and uhh... I said before I took her\nDon't choke me! And it's up up and away I took the hooker\nAnd it's on\n\nVerse Two: Redman\n\nWe landed on my planet, we smoked out like a fuck up\nBought a dime from Jabba the Hut and some uncut for the hooker\nShe said, \"I don't sniff blow I just smoke weed to get me horny\nSo I'm nothin like that bitch in your last Soopaman Lovah story.\"\nYou go girl! But I didn't believe her, had to make sure\nWhere you from, the projects? \"Yeahhhh, but I'm single\nYou needed a quickie and I'm just that bitch to break you off, shit\nMy pussy's so good, it tickle my legs when I walk!\"\nOh really, just show me a couple of ways how you'll thrill me\nShe lifted up her dress and the whole area got chilly\n\"So what you think of that?\" I threw that bitch back on my back\nShit I live ten miles away, but I made it fo' seconds flat\nI lived in the same building with Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk\nGot R2-D2 and Mork from Ork puttin in work\nSee I got the block sewn \"Oooh baby let's get it on!\"\nAbout time, I opened the door she had her ass and tits showin\nShe rushed me to the room and stripped me out of my attire\nShe tied me to the bedposts then she lit the room on fire\nShe took out a scarf wrapped it around my eyes till I was blind\nBut with my X-Ray vision I saw the icepick from behind\nSo I broke out the ropes, smacked the ho, then suplexed her\nShe pulled out a Tec and wet my chest with the S was\n\"Oh shit I'm shot!\" There was blood all over my finger!\nI think I left my other bulletproof suit in the cleaner\nShe gave a whistle, they came in crews, word is bond\nIt was a bunch of Martian bitches with bodysuits and Platforms\n\"Damn, I gotta think of a plan, whatamIdo?\nDid Superman have a gun?\" Nah, but the Soopaman Lovah do!\nSo I pulled out the fo'-fifth, left the bitches open\nHad another clip in case some mo' bitches want mo' shit\nAnd I saw that trick Bewitched flying on her broomstick\nPa-dow! Shot her down because I leave no witness\nJob well done I cleaned myself in a hurry\nOops! Gotta catch this blunt session\nWith I Dream of Jeannie and Keith Murray\nAiyyyo-yo-yo Keith aiyyo what's up?\nAiyyo"

Where a nigga like you'd get laughed at\nAnd since you came out gassed, well I'm closin your gas cap\nThe creature, from the deeper, ultimate funk freaker\nRepresent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the Preacher\nA menace like Dennis, I got game like Ennis\nI can french-kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentence\nLord have mercy! It's too much funk to cope with\nDroppin dope shit after dope shit, we're atrocious\nThat's from the lungs, that rings from here to kingdom come\nAnd I don't have to be a Special Ed to get dumb!!\n\nSo fuck what ya heard, word to herb\n'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama\nPlus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ\n(From Newark New Jersey, in the place to be)\nSo fuck what ya heard, word to herb\n'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama\nPlus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ\n(Because I can jam like Teddy if you let me)\n(Is they here to stay?)\n(I'll be outside when you get there)"

Would you please tell me a story?\n-Alright, get over here and sit yo' big ass down\nLemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...\n\n[Verse 1]\nAyo, I was out for lunch and shit, puffin' on a blunt to get my head wrecked\nBoogie'n to my Walkman with an \"S\" on my chest\n(Bust a move!) Yes, I'm a superhero, don't forget\nI smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes\nBut anyway, let's get back to this skit\nYou know who the fuck I am, so git off that ol' bull-\nShucks! Lunchtime was up\u2014FUCK!\nLet me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks\nOn the way back, Jack, I spotted this object, a stray cat\nStuck in a tree, with a tag that says that:\n\"If found, please return to this address\"\n(How did you see it?) Nigga, with my X-ray eye set!\nLike \"Pchoooooooww\", I jetted to the closest phone-booth\nQuick flash, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...\n(Johnny 'Guitar' Watson: I can leap tall buildings...yeah...\nIn a single bound...)\nBoom! Right through the fuckin' phone booth ceiling\n(It's a, it's a plane!) Nah, Sooperman Lover's the name\nI can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains\nOn a mission, to save this cat that was wishin'\nHe was in his litter, watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n\nRelaxin', feet cocked up, just a little\nWith a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles\nI snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon\nQuick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'\nThen landed at the cat's tag address in the projects\n(Elevator's broken!) So I had to take the back steps\n(Knock, Knock) The door opened then my eyes swole\nFrom this badass honey sippin' a quart of Old Gold\n\"Yo, is this your cat?\" \"Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?\"\n\"He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan\"\n\"Well, how the hell did you save him? Are you police undercover?\"\n\"Naw baby the \"S\" on my chest stands for\"\n\n[Hook]\nSooperman Lover, yeah\nSaid they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah\nBut something wrong...\nThere's something wrong with me\nThere's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was grateful, lookin' for ways to repay me\nNo money, a donut, and some..uhm coffee maybe?\n\"Of course, what kind to show that I thank ya?\"\n\"Make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka\"\nWe sat, unhooked the cape from my back\nShe felt my arms 'cause my pythons looked stacked\n\"Goddamn, Sooperlover! Yo shit look thick\nTell me, how strong are you with muscles like this?\nYou bad motherfucker!\" (I'm stronger than a locomotive)\nAkhi hit ya like Rocky\nShe dashed to the room and came back with an ounce\nNegligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth\nReady to roll up, hey hold up, she had the dollar fold up\nTo mix the coke with the smoke, yo, she was no joke\nShe took a sniff, some got on her top lip\nThat bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick\nAnd said: \"Here baby, hit it.\" \"Naw baby, I ain't wit' it\nYou'd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit!\"\nBut I'll hit the blunt, so she took out her fronts\nCracked the Phillie, opened the bag, and laid out the skunk\nThen I took a long pull, it was hype, oughta sight\nShe ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room\nLater, tossed the cover and, oh brother, I was wit' it\nReady to hit it asked my dick (Yo, wassup, G?)\nYo, man, shit's thick\nLicked her on her belly then kissed her down her back\nStuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack\nAs big as mine (Ewwww!) This bitch must be craze\nSo I threw my suit on and I was Swayze...\n'Cause I'm the\n\n[Hook]\nSooperman Lover, yeah\nSaid they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah\nBut something wrong...\nThere's something wrong with me\nThere's something wrong, yeah, yes it is..."

My life's on the line\nBullets in their clips and none in mine\nSirens on, once again it's on\nI fell (OW!) and then the black Glocks went (POW!)\nI got snuffed and I got bust\nNow the only thing I'm sniffin' is dust, because it's...\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n\n[Verse 2]\nMe and Erick Sermon taking a trip Uptown\nIn the 4Runner, blastin' my tape, puffin' ganja\nSince Erick got props\nI stepped to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop\nFlexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me\nIt was no doubt that baby cakes was hawkin' me\nSo I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific\nNot knowin' she was scopin' me 'cause I was MAD splifted\nLater on that week, honeydip freaked the funk\nPlayin' Redman and Erick out like two chumps\nCallin' him weekdays, callin' me weeknights\n(Who had her weekends?) Whichever man would freak right\nThings got cozy one night like dynamite\nWe stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts\n(No hats? Damn, black) The Funkadelic\nTook a splash \u2014 you know how that go, fellas\nTwo months later (See you later, alligator)\nShe was pissed and I ended up seein' my physician\nShe took a blood test, she took a head check\nLooked at me thinkin', \"Why the hell he isn't dead yet?\"\nThen I asked her, \"Why you lookin' at me?!\"\nShe said, \"Redman, because you have the HIV\"\nCalled Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!\nToo late, 'cause Erick already had his drawers down\n'Cause it's\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n'Cause it's so rough\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo all my brothers, wear your hats, wear your hats\nYou can either get with this or you can either catch the claps\nAnd to my sisters, make 'em wear they prophyl-lastic\n'Cause it's drastic, havin' another ghetto bastard\nThink I'm dying for a piece of butt? Honey, you must be nuts\nYou better settle for a wet kiss, so pucker up\n'Cause you end up messin' around catchin' the heebie jeebies\nLookin' like \"WHODUNNIT?\" Witcha face up on the TV\nSo next time you want sex, get wreck, but protect\n'Cause you could be like sexin' to your last death\nAnd if you still don't know the time, press rewind\n'Cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline\nWord\n[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP]"

Buy the video or Redman sculpture\nFor your mantle, damn you\nToo hard to handle\nE-Double slam once, and Redman slam two\nBreak hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ\nOkay, bust the big gate\nFor microphones that have swollen mic cords\nPE fights for power\nRedman fights for soul power\nFunk is strong as a tree trunk\nAsk me the flavor\nMake mines the P-Funk\n\n[Hook]\nMake my funk the P-Funk\nI want my funk uncut (Make mine the P)\nMake my funk the P-Funk (Wants to get funked up)\nI wants to get funked up\n\n[Outro]\nI'm back with the funk, chump\nYou want funk? How many lumps?\nI got spunk\nI'm well-known like Donald Trump\nI'm not..."

'Cause I'm bad (Word to mother)\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)\nI'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed\nI'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)\nI'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed\n\n[Interlude]\nYo yo, check this out\nThis is for y'all hokey-pokey punk pussy motherfuckers\nJust to show y'all I do what the fuck I wanna do\nI want y'all to check this on the real\nAnd yo, check this out\nShake it! C'mon shake it! C'mon shake it! C'mon shake it!\nWhassup now? Whassup now? Whassup now? Whassup now?\nWhattup now? Hahahahah\n(Yo Red, c'mon, get back to the track man, I wanna get out of here!)\nYo kid chill, a'ight, a'ight, check it out\n\n[Verse 2]\nFlexy I'm sexy when I'm standin' in my drawers\nIf you can't check me when I'm rappin', put the tape on pause\nAnd listen to the incredible shit that I kick my man\nGive me five on the backhand then stick\nYour finger in a hole and chop the stick quick\n'Cause my lip get to the point, to STILL rock the fly shit\nSince you're holding your breath, I hold my jewels\nI swing hardcore, so I walk, holdin' my tools\nThe original P-Funk, takes no junk, from a chump, or punk, G\nI been this way every since nine months\nSo get down while I rip the raps from my lip 'cause\nMy shit's more deep than any tape from Enigma\nThe gettin' nice, thinkin' killer brother who pop trash\nBasic instinct \u2014 I'm a shooter so they got blasted\nMuch ass I kick, groove to the master mix\nMy song still pumps when it's not even mastered, bitch!\nMy shit's very chronic so rewind it\n'Cause it's like.. eh-eh-eh-eh beyond, bionic!\n'Cause I'm a wild and crazy guy! No lie!\nLast brother to battle me I started pissin' in his eye\nI'm bad, word to mother, to the motherfuckin' Hubbard\nEatin' her curds and whey, puffin spliffs 'cause she doesn't\nAnd if you still don't under-fuckin-stand where I'm comin' from\nListen to my nine, understand where it's hummin' from!\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)\nI'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed\nI'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)\nI'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed"

While your brains get jacked\nI'm souped like two scoops of funk juice, word to mother\nThe way I kick you swore that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker\nThe darkside brings apartheid\nI act wild like them niggas from Chi-Town on the Southside\nSweeter than this, whoopin niggas down like Jack Nich\nWhen I backflip my tactic graphics\nOoooooh! Redman jams it in\nDue to difficulties I won't be done by ten\nFriend I got bust shots out the twelve Benz\nAnd then we get the bam-ba-zee from one-ten\nOr is it further up? Plus my style murder ducks\nSo what the fuck, you got the mic turned up fo'?\nWhen I Chief Rock underground MC's drop like sheet rock\nHere's a ride to the underground\n\n[Hook](repeat 2X)\nTo the beat y'all...\nAh to the beat y'all, I do the freak y'all\nI keep the buddha to last me through the week y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Redman]\nCome take a trip on my cosmic movie boogie flicks\nFar beyond space so niggas say your grace\nIt's a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzeneggar\nWhen a baby, I had other babies in labor catchin vapors\nWith two gats I move like too fast like Paxton\nAsk Toni Braxton who got seven days of action\nBlack stars or moons eclipse the volume\nBang zoom I'm sendin honies on the moon with ten bags of boom\nRidiculously I will rip an MC\nTo degrees I leave spots like chicken pox, check the synopsis\nI grow confusing just like Rubik's cube boxes\nFloat like the butter, fly so what if I\nBlow your lenses, tear the fuckin hinges\nDid I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahs than a dentist\nWhen I'm in this, the knotty-headed era causes terror\nY'all gimmick motherfuckers better get y'all shit together\nOne for the money and two for my peeps\nNynex can't even reach my technique or rap sheets\nFor the Squad I lick two shots word to God\nThen take y'all dreams and imaginations\nTo the darkside"

Then let me reiterate\nBoy I'm hustla, throw one of them knuckles up\nWalk in the restaurant, hand on your jugular\nRide in that BM better buckle up\nBack game crumbling, bricks gon' double up\nI tee off hoes, look how my putter up\nOld folks say I cut her off lil sum sum\nOnly one champion and you're the runner up\nCoo coo for cocoa puffs, watch when I perch him up\nD.O.C., guzzlin' Hennessy\nFuck the club nigga and fuck securityyy\n\nNow when I do a show\nI rely on my gros to pick me up off the flo'\n(Fuck Da Security)\nBecause I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in the crowd\nSecurity like \"fuck you yo!\"\n(Fuck Da Security)\n\n[Hook]"

When I wipe off my sweat\nVerbally I'm Untouchable like Elliot Ness\nTo the best of my ability I rock any facility\nAnd fuck the yellow cabs I smoke buddha out deliveries\nI'm just as high as the fuckin friendly skies\nWhen I'm, open, you can't even see my chinky eyes\nCause the buddha I smoke, is no joke, when I'm loc'ed\nThen I wet it, then you be like -- that shit be soaked!!\nI'm saggin my.... Karl Kani...\nAnd Too Black Guys when I get busy like the L.I\nWell I, swing it back and forth like a leaf\nWithout traffic I flow like the B.Q.E\nBut I can blast niggas straight out of first-class\nThen leave em huffin and puffin like first day at Lamaze class\nPPP, got the Glocks and techs\nAnd Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck\n\n[Hook]\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike) (Styles that I'm kickin', yes I'm mad wicked)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike) (Styles that I'm kickin', yes I'm mad wicked)\n\n[Verse 2: Redman]\nA-hem...\nThe Funk Doctor Spock blow the watt through your box\nI come hotter than Treach, you bet about callin the cops\nBecause (this type of funk you don't hear on the regular)\nRock six seven eight nine ten (to eleven ta)\nNoon! My style got more powers than Cocoon\nZoom your focus, I drop the mic and leave it smokin\nWhen I'm vexed, my concepts Wreck like Effect\nVerbal communications blow to the next ep\nI'm robbin your brains with antilogical, phenomical\nSuicidal with lethal type funk spread your nodules\nStraight up the weight up plus I max like a Beta\nBoy I fuck your head up like a blunt that's laced up\nThe boogie verbalist, vocalist\nI get open with, puttin scannings on the fake soloist\nMy style reachin down like Ike, switch up like dykes and\nYou'll be tellin your psychiatrist wuditlooklike\n\n[Hook]\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike) (Styles that I'm kickin', yes I'm mad wicked)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike) (Styles that I'm kickin', yes I'm mad wicked)\n\n[Verse 3: Redman]\nWuditlooklike suckers, punk motherfuckers\nBitches be actin funny, don't wanna show me no love cuz\nThey think I'm crazy and like mentally sick\nAhhh, give em the dick then they quiver like fish, then I\nSmoke a pound of herb a day, and yo\nSome bitches say, I'm the Mack like Maceo\nI don't be that I just beez the funk disease\nThat leave MC's, recognizing like Sam Sneed\nThe funkindominal, I bring drama to any rendezvous\nRock three-sixty-five, twenty-four, Monday through\nThat other shit, makes them other ship, flip\nFunk ridiculous, inconspicous with lyrics\nA-uhhm, oh-seven-one-oh-three's where I from\nBeen gettin dumb, every since Harlem World used to jump\nAnd that's for all them hardrock niggas that's comin in flocks\nI bust off the Glock for the hood and the block\n\n[Hook]\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike) (Styles that I'm kickin', yes I'm mad wicked)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nI said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)\nWuditlooklike (wuditlooklike) (Styles that I'm kickin', yes I'm mad wicked)"

(You)\nWho the ultimate?

Raow!\"\nMy guns go boom, boom, and your guns go pow pow!\nStill, I feel a chill, bumps in my body\nThe spirits of other MC's records in the party\nCause, me being, the man that I am\nI'm awfully hunted by them guns with wide lens on the scope\nSucka, you miss, I'm a get my laugh on\nYou fuck around and woke up, with the stash gone\nHow I spaz on niggas is ugly\nYou got the game fucked up on makin' the money\nSee I don't say I'm thugged out, but I know my choice\nBack up plans, got back up; if I blow my voice\nThat's why I'm Brick City, can't wait to put my niggas on\nTo see us perform, we sellin' out at Ticket Tron\nWhat I'm doing is wrong, but It lasts long\nYo, toast the niggas that passed on\nGet it while the gettin good, whole life with a grip\nCause when it's gone, that's it, that's it, that's it!\n\n[Hook 2X]\nI'm seeing dead people creepin on my income\nYou win some, you lose some, but you never run\n\n[Verse 2: Redman]\n(Yo what's on, come on)\nRedman it's the war head; BOOM!\nNigga I don't die, I was born dead\nTop of the mornin' to ya, I wake up like a born loser\nThe world is my Bermuda; Triangle and I'm lost in it\nI'm hearin' voices saying \"Red, the wanna put holes in ya authentic\"\nI walk among winners and I put out work, nigga\nAnd I don't stop, until I squirt\nHaters hate on, you can tell the rest of the class\nI can see the evil in you, through a masculine task\nSmoke the greenest grass I live by the hand of god\nThat me, ya boys, or ya guns won't leave a scar\nYou niggas too hard and not ready to scrap\nKnowin' damn well, ya moms raised you better than that\nRedman the weirdo, I'm my own dirty clique\nWith 35 KO's nigga I'll make it 36!\n\n[Hook 2X]\n\n[Verse 3: Redman]\nThou shall not fuck with raw, Funk Docta\nTakin' ya breath when I drop ya\nI feel for you cause cats, try to test me\nYou a waiteress set of an MC, check please\nBeen waited way too long, now it's time to put Gilla on the map\nGilla on ya back, same Zombies, from Phila on attack\nNiggas want it back, Triggas on the map\nWon't stop me, I'm not a quitter that's a rap\nIf I was just broke you wouldn't notice me\nHa, Ha, but look at the bright side my man\nNobody really planned to fail, you really failed the plan\nGotta keep the bomb like an Israeli hand\nMy music's killa, your's girlie; Scram!\nI can hang out in the same place as my fans\nLet 'em touch me, feel how far that I swam\nLook in my eyes, ya noddin to sleep\nIt ain't a watch, as Eminem, providin the beat\nThat's why..\n\n[Hook 4X]"

Then holla at ya bro\nSean Paul need a light for his video, I'm on my 2nd lighter\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nAyo man, you got a light?\nI said nah nigga, the last person i lent my lighter to\nRan off wit her\nThat's why I'm on high alert, like Wyatt Earp\nAnd plus I need my lighter for lightin' my fireworks\nI got one blunt, I got my own light\nI smoke alone like, Nas need one mic\nI ask DJ if he had [?]...he said\nFreeway took it when he turned\nI'm on my 2nd lighter\n\n[Hook]"

And we gon' hooo-oooh-ooh\n(Tell me what you doin)\n\nC'mon, yo yo-yo yo, yo yo\nI had to put the mash down, throw the cash around\nStay focused, on the case put the hash down\nJetted through the air about five miles per hour\nMy mojo gone I can't fly like I wanna\nBut this case is easy, find that motherfucker that\nCouldn't wait to be me, put his face on TV\nFrom the Tec blow, I asked my ex-hoes\nPass off some info for a pair of X.O.'s\n\"Write the check low, I don't do that\nI told you that shit before when I boned your back!\"\nNow I'm back to square one, and everybody hatin\nSo I popped the flare gun, now they all escapin\nRan into Gator, from Jungle Fever\nHe's my people and my neighbor, I said I need a favor\nHe said \"For ten dollars, and for ten Whoppers\nFrom Burger King, I'll tell you the nigga who gotcha.\"\nGave him what he wanted plus the extra large fry\nHe said \"Blue eyes, blonde hair, a white guy\"\nI said... \"What the fuck going on?!\nA white guy interrupting my fuck flowing on?\"\nSo I copped some new ammo, reloaded my flare gun\nStalking like Rambo, mixed with Commando\nGator pushed the ten-speed bike, I'm on the handle\nCrashed into somethin cause he high off my man blow\nI jumped up and backtracked myself\nWho's the last ho I fucked or throat I cut\nI said \"Wait a minute, yo, that bitch Jane on the prowl again\nI bet she up to no good, actin foul again\nYeah, yeah, it ain't nuttin, I get her if I want her\nMatter of fact I'm gonna cause she live around the corner.\"\nI walked up scared with my hands on my flares and my armor\nCause she bring drama like Jeffrey Dahmer\nBut I heard fuckin all the way from the bottom\nI'm like, \"Damn she yelling!\"  Kinda made me jealous\nKnocked on the door enraged\nLike a broke-ass rapper, at a label that ain't toured in days\n\"Do it clown, before I count to four now\nCause if I hit five them flares'll blow your door down!\"\nI heard the zipper zip up, and they was tryin to run\nSo I re-clipped the clip up, and blew it before one\n\"Freeze motherfuckers!\", I jumped on Jane back\n\"I want the cheese motherfuckers! And my name back.\"\nWe tussling, fighting, biting skin and rustling\nSlaps in the face, chokes with the belt buckle and\nHer knees buckling, I thought to myself\n\"Where's that motherfuckin white guy she was fuckin?\" then\nRight out the blue {*CLANG!*} Owww! {*birds chirpin*}\nWho dat?  Who dere?\n\n.. (this program will be continued)"

Who takin my women?\nWho takin my chickens around Thanksgiving? Now that's pimpin!\"\nCalled my man Meth and Bishop Don Juan\nHe smokin a blunt, other sippin Chandon\nHe said it ain't the game, but how you play it\nSo I can't hate the game, so I'm dyin to play it\nNow I'm back in the air, ready to put my smack down\nI'm searchin for the impostor to pat down\nI'm urgin to put the Glock up and clap rounds\nIt's curtains like Jimmy Hoffa, he not found\nSo ride on me, try homie\nYour plan'll fail like the Acme Kit from Coyote\nNow I'mma find the bastard that stole my juice\nSoopaman Part Five, in your archives\n\n[Singers]\nI'm yo Soopaman baby, that's who I am\nFlyin through the air, without a care\nI'm high as hell blazin, that Cali weed (Kryptonite for life)\nThat Kryptonite bud, that sticky green\nI'm yo' Soopaman (he's yo' Soopaman) I'm yo' Soopaman\nI'm yo' Soopaman (whoaaa yea yea yea yea) I'm yo' Soopaman\nI'm yo' Soopaman (he's high as hell for life)\nI'm yo' Soopaman (that Cali weed)\nI'm yo' Soopaman (Kryptonite baller)\nI'm yo' Soopaman (sticky green)\n\n{*needle drags across the record*}"

My click's the greatest\nChill, or feel the effect of hi-atus\nShit shuts down when the Squad's around\nIt gets _Thinner_, it's hexed like white man from town\nThree the hard way can't be touched\nMy style's too faraway, to capture, even with help from NASA\nI'm what they call, a living legend, sha-POW\nThat's what they call, a Mac-11, sha-POW\nThere's two on the way down, BLAOW BLAOW\nHere's two more, BLAOW BLAOW nigga!\n\n[Keith Murray]\nIs y'all niggas down to ride?

(Man listen)\n\n[Redman]\nYo-yo-yo yo, yo yo!\nI got the Down South Funk when I clown out punk-ass\nPolice wanna call dogs and sound off pumps\nI short your Blaupunkts if you thump my tape\nYo dial funk if you're mo' stiff than Rikers Isle bunks\nGet out your seat, E, spit out the beat\nThe tracks plow underground concrete out the streets\nFrom baldies to fades, when I rock MC's wave\nMore flags than Puerto Rican Day parade\nAnd give up, I got the rare footage, of fiends walkin\nBarefooted off my rhyme don't dare cook it\nYou might fall in to intervene\nAnd New Jacks and they girl become Pookie and that, PROM QUEEN\nThat bodybag won't fit you tonight\nYou wanna blow up? Drop the mic, stick to the pipe\nHand to hand my crew'll cripple your click in a fight\nTake my tapes way Down South and triple the price\nStep up on the scene like whazzup? Hey sugah\nBefore you cock-tease Doc, how that cash put up?\nAnd only way I stop til your click say when\nThey had enough, cause I could bump to six A.M\n\n[Keith Murray]\nIs y'all niggas down to ride? (Man listen)\nWould you kill for your life? (Man listen)\nCan you get busy all night? (Man listen)\n(Yo, yo-yo) (Man listen)\n\nMy life is a rap, each song is a flashback\nOf antagonizing anxiety attacks\nThe beat hits the ground and the earth cracks\nNiggas be like, \"OH NO NOT THEM!\" Yeah we back\nWith rhythmatic articulation, God-forsaken\nSick manifestations, PUMP PUMP in your face then\nThe lyrical force that I put in a rhyme\nWill hit you with more power than a molecule enzyme\nNo matter who what when where how I'll lay you down\nWith a sick illed out fictitious style\nYo, we all represent the hood -- the only difference\nBetween us is that we make the shit look good!\nProgrammable annual slammable\nYou Lyte as a Rock and I Cram to Understand You\nSo for niggas on a mission kissin ass and dissin\nWe get even like an ambixdeterous, man listen\n\nIs y'all niggas down to ride? (Man listen)\nWould you kill for your life? (Man listen)\nCan you get busy all night? (Man listen)\n(Man listen)\n\nIs y'all niggas down to ride? (Man listen)\nWould you kill for your life?

You know\nIt's times like this\nWhen we need change nigga\nYeah, and if you really look at it\nYour life is like a movie\nAnd we all in the script playin a role\nLet's go!\n\n[Hook]\nMic bright, lights, camera, action {*4X*}\n\"You are, now, playing, a rapper\" - ACTION\n\n[Redman]\nYo, I speak clearly, for y'all to hear me\nRotate while I show the world like Mary\nSleepin rarely, too much beast for the Aries\nGilla! Get cream like, Ben & Jerry's\nToo fly to mail me, C.O.D\nOpened up my mind and let my ego free\nNow the world know my government, and I'm lovin it\nAll levels, from White House to the covenant\nBig boy, when the mics and the lights on\nYou get a three minute glimpse of the icon\nYour best rapper two-steppin to my song\nWhen he don't know, he ask I write for him\nJersey lights, that's where I live\nWhere I get lost like one of Kennedy kids\nThen I reappear when it's \"Time 4 Aksion\"\nThen disappear again like LaToya Jackson, it's\n\n[Hook]\nMic bright, lights, camera, action {*4X*}\n\"You must, now, protect, the President\" - ACTION\n\n[Redman]\nYo, by any means I protect my President\nIt's P.O.P., protect our president\nA thoroughbred on the track like the meadowlands\nThe Secret Service should bring the ghetto in\nFor example, I start up a dot com\nFor terrorism, a P.O.P. hotline\nJoin the club if you're ready to rub\nElbows with folks who feel oh-nine is our time\nThat's the motto, yeah I know Bush\nMade bein President one tough act to follow\nWatch the Lewinskis that just wanna swallow\nRemember Kobe Bryant up in Colorado\nLock me in asylum, your boy too ill with it\nYour life is campaign and that's real bid'ness\nSet up shop and group your team\nCause they ain't doin what they did to Martin Luther King\nF'real!\n\n[Hook]\nMic bright, lights, camera, action {*4X*}\n\"You will, now, save, hip-hop\" - ACTION\n\n[Redman]\nYo, they said hip-hop been gone for a minute\nI gotta find hip-hop and tour more with it\nThat's my cash cow, wow, go hard\nLike the ninth inning, tryin to score for the pennant\nSky's not the limit, I'm on a quest\nTo bring back originality, style and concept\nShow you how to write 16's with context\nMix it with a little Lil Wayne and KRS\nThat's fresh! Dummy, study the art\nStudy how it all began and see the part\nStudy how Kool Herc became King of Bronx\nLearn, how to rock Wallabees and Clarks\nI think I found hip-hop dawg, she right here\nListen up homey it might help your career\nI'm goin to the top cause I'm ready for action\nThen disappear again like LaToya jackson, it's\n\n[Hook]\nMic bright, lights, camera, action {*4X*}"

Rap, fuck where you be at\nMake moves where you sleep at, the realness what MC's lack\nSo I kick subliminals for all hardcore criminals\nGiving you, something funky to listen to\nDramatic, wiping your crew off with automatics\nGhetto tactics, backwards, I can knock the world off it's axis\nAnd the buddah keeps my luger hot as Freddie Kruger\nWho's the, next loser, to show their true colors\nBrothers and sisters, I'm like a Motion Picture\nRedman's the name, occupation? Smoking niggas\nI does it, I do it\nI represent Newark to the fullest I could prove it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Redman]\nYou know my style, steelo\nThrow more bombs then Dan Marino\nI jams like Groover Washington live at the BeJu\nFlatline people I'm live, lyrics are evil\nI got connections up on Pluto *schhh* I read you\nThe cock thriller, vagina killer\nMy nine miller, and my niggas\nControl dirty raps like Willer\nRecognize, im from The Bricks, Dee pack two clips\nLex got two tecs in the Lex, in case shit flips\nSo who's the next contestant to flex\nI translate like Fugees, whether live or Memorex\nDef Squad crew always got some fly shit on deck\nCause it ain't where you from, it's about where you at\n\n[Hook]"

King'em\nFound my way back home like E.T. finger\nI rock the arena, you know the drill\nGet high, get drunk, grab a ho and chill\nEat a meal, then back to the hood for more action\nPromotin' Red Gone Wild with no backin\nDoc get five on the mic like Joe Jackson\nForeign bitches feelin me for my accent\nTalk like a boss, I can't complain\nWhen I do it, it's big like Fulton & St. James\nI got Brick City, even D.C. bitches\nThey all steal for me outta P.C. Richards\nI move like a pimp, but I'm far from one\nLike Lil Weez, I got army guns\nGimmie one, nigga\n\n(Hook)\n1, and here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4\nAnd here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)\nAnd here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4\nAnd here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)\nAnd here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4\nAnd here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)\nAnd here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, If you don't like me, fuck you, I flex one muscle\nDoc got more effects than Kung Fu Hustle\nI'm uptown, buyin the purp\nLookin cut clean, jeans, Moschin', designer shirt\nRedman fell off, what ya talks about?\nI wasn't lettin y'all swim when the shark was out\nRollin red carpet out, it's Jersey\nMe and them together is like Lil' Seymour and Big Percy\nI knew women from high school that picked on me\nNow I see them, they all wanna lick on me\nI hood down homie, rock like Bon Jovi\nI can work the nightshift like Yvonne Mobley\nBrick City, boy, my flow is on fire\nDisagree, I go in your mouth like botox\nPick up Pete Rock, nigga, we all cool\nHit the highway and ask, \"Is the CL smooth?\" nigga\n\n(Hook)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYour style might be parkay, but mine butter\nThat bitch can't break no bread, then why fuck her\nI'm kinda cocky, homeboy, did I stutter?\nI popped the umbilical cord on my mother\nI jumped out the womb, I became a whale\nThat's hard to harpoon, I need more room\nThe hood love me, so I keep it real gully\nI got handsome, but my flow is still ugly\nTurn the treble out the track and I'll G it\nThe lines in my rhyme are longer than Ikea\nI stay on my grind, but when I come up with an idea\nThen yeah, it's party over here!\nIt's 5 years I disappeared, but I'm back\nAnd tell Nino Brown and them that I'm crack\nGrab my bozack, middle finger is up\nI got your grandma givin it up\nGimmie one, nigga!\n\n(Hook)"

Turn me down a little bit\nYeah yeah yeah\n\nYo, first of all I'm a grown-ass man, pay my own bills\nStated own real, haters gon' feel\nDirect Syndrome, mouth with cold tongue\nYou bounty hunters be on the chase for Joe Young\nI won't slip, keep pink slips to my car\nI'm raw like sushi bars on bougie broads\nI retrieve the money, dawg labrador\nRay Charles can see it, and Stacy Lattisaw\nYou get mashed out, cause your bird is peckin\nDon't be the next vinyl cut to _Urban Legend_\nI can feel where you at, when I pound you up\nYou out of town coke rhymes, oh you clowns is up\nMy crew stay in the truck, can't fit in the Porsche\nIf you bitches ain't happy, then get a divorce\nI'mma do what I want, cause my time is now\nGrab the whole rap game, and divide it down\n\nIf I wanna roll a Jeep with a seat out the back\nBitch feet out the back, system beat out the track\nAm I wrong for dat? (If that's what you like)\nDawg, am I wrong for dat? (Hey, I guess not)\nYo yo, if I walk into the club with my hand on my snub\nBeatin down security cause I don't give a fuck\nAm I wrong for dat? (Mmm mmm)\nDawg, am I wrong for dat? (Say WHAAAAT?!)\n\nYo Keith, yo yo Keith\n{*sound of jail door opening*}\n\n[Keith Murray]\nI copped the whole box, went half with Reginald\nHollow tips infrareds and (?) clips came free\nAnd you ain't gotta believe me, fuck bein nervous\nFar as I'm concerned they're at your funeral service\nWhat do we have here? Snitch in despair, shoot off his ear\nHave his whole body shakin in fear\nStormtrooper fires throwin lashin out flames\nA few ashes, when they analyze your remains\nI live in the streets, reside with the toolie\nI kill you like it's part of my religious duty\nStreet sweeper thug keeper sweepin thugs under the rug\nEven females who think they thugs\nTrigger the release of adrenaline\nWhen I'm gangsta-trippin like the Bloods'n'Crips'n'them\nUnleash the matter of energy, killin 'em\nWhy'd you do it? Because I wasn't feelin them!\n\n[Redman]\nIf I ride through the hood, smokin a ounce of haze (uh-huh)\nWith a shabby haircut, pants I wore for days\nAm I wrong for dat? (I don't think so)\nC'mon bitch, am I wrong for dat? (Say WHAAAAT?!)\nYo, if I want a fat chick that keep her toes done (uh-huh)\nWhen they playin my song ass spill out the thong\nAm I wrong for dat? (Got that big ass)\nAm I wrong for dat? (Tchk, nooo)\n\nI gotta, bang the boogie to that bang bang pussy\nTo that bang to the pussy the beat, beat\nAnd if yo', bitch ain't sippin that Cristal shit\nThen she might be leavin with D, D\nI got a hairy-ass chest, like Austin Powers\nThat bitch that \"Stan\" drowned, I fucked around with her\nAct like a man, stand on your own two\nDoc takin it all, fuck who it belong to"

Shut your mouth\nWhen Jersey in the building, I (rock the house!)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)\nYo, what you consider the best, what you invest\nA half a mill' around your neck? Let me guess\nPunchlines after punchline for a check\nI did that, when GangStarr had to \"Get a Rep\"\nMy city in debt, that's why I sound hungry\nMy flow dumb as fuck like Al Bun-dy\nAsk Treach, I do it for my lonely\nAll y'all come and get it if you want me (let's rock the house)\nMan, I'm a funny ass nigga"

Uhh\nThat's my nine in you, feelin nauseous that's my rhyme in you\nI swing funk like numchuks my game's death\nThat's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul\nHot like lava's fire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech\nMy funk speech make words wear sun visors\nI'm gettin down with the funk in your trunk\nDef Squad's in the house, with the ... for all you punks\n\n\"Coming down the block man loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\" - A Tribe Called Quest \"Midnight\"\n(repeat 4X)\n\nAhhh, I'm just as high as three peeled up motherfuckers\nDef Squad's in the house, with the ... for you suckers\nPunks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once twice\nI'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight\nThe top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped\nI'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amenesia\nI'm swifter than roller blades on Icecapades\nI'm Fearless like Four plus I'm +Kool+ like +Aid+\nMy grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama\nI never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters\nMy style gets Death like Row or Def like Jeff\nDef like Jam or Squad, or death like Meth\nOne two! Big up to my niggas on one deuce\nThat cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in...\nRrrrrah! With weed for you!\nWho says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopez?\nI'm cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up\nYou better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers\nCause Redman will bomb just like Sadaam\nWhen I'm loose I'm worldwide like triple fat goose\nHeavily armed\n\n\"Coming down the block man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\" -- Q-Tip\n(repeat 4X)"

(No one no one)\nDo a buck 50 (on the highway)\nWit ya woman head on my lap\nTryna keep up wit me\nGilla nigga, dog\nWriting bombs in gorilla paws\nDon't applause\nI shit at seminars I ain't even draw\nMy God's my gun\nDon't need 'em son, cerebral cock\nBeetle size ammo\n3 to 5 mammal we the guys\nThat'll shit in ya turf\nThat'll get in ya skirt\nI love Alicia so I'ma give what a woman is worth\nI heard them niggas go\n*Buck buck bidda bluck*\nThen hide 'em Inside of\nMy noggin is strange (*howl*)\nWhen them dogs is ridin'\n'Cause I'm a cheap fucker, block usher\nEat supper wit\nPack of wolves that act a fool\nBlood on they upper lip\nNeed a nigga? I'm that nigga to call\nNigga to draw chainsaws\nTo the brawl\nCuttin' ya ligaments off (Yo)\n\n[Chorus - Icadon]\n'Ey yo we future future thugs\nNigga we bear the minerals\nTwo tares subliminal\nThese here is criminal\nDon't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)\nWe swear at interviews\nSwitch gears up in the coupe\nWe future thugs!\n\n'Ey yo we future future thugs\nNigga we bear the minerals\nTwo tares subliminal\nThese here is criminal\nDon't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)\nWe swear at interviews (Where dem horns at?)\nSwitch gears up in the coupe (Dun dun dun dun da-dunnn!)\nWe future thugs!\n\n[Verse 2 - Ghostface Killah]\n('Ey yo what up, yo?)\nY'all bitch niggas playin' me real close\nSteppin' on my Wally's but Iron Man walk wit steel toes\nWe used to rush arenas but now we just steal shows\nMy eagle attracting people\nLook, it's made out of pure gold\nVersace rose colorful lens\nMatchin' my Timbs\nBlacked out Benz\nStop frontin' 'cause we back out twins\nIt's Doc and Deini\nNIgga go and cock the semi\nPut a million in the hood\n'Cause our blocks is needy\nJean jackets with graffiti\nRope chains with the Nefertiti charms\nSealin' the packages up with them greasy palms\nThe only way y'all can see me\nIs if the TV's on\nMy reign unanimous\nI got the belt and I'ma handle it\nBlow you out like candlesticks\nMicrophone vandalist\nEvangelist\nAnalyst and my style is not to be tampered with\nFlows on some cancer sick\nHorns I don't answer it\nThem phone suits don't have all my money\nBet I will cancel it\n\n[Chorus - Icadon]\n'Ey yo we future future thugs\nNigga we bear the minerals\nTwo tares subliminal\nThese here is criminal\nDon't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)\nWe swear at interviews\nSwitch gears up in the coupe\nWe future thugs!\n\n'Ey yo we future future thugs\nNigga we bear the minerals\nTwo tares subliminal\nThese here is criminal\nDon't be starin' at generals (future future thugs)\nWe swear at interviews (Where dem horns at?)\nSwitch gears up in the coupe (Dun dun dun dun da-dunnn!)\nWe future thugs!\n\n[Verse 3 - Ludacris]\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait up! Hold up! Hold up!\nWithout\nFurther ado let me get this show on the road\nFuture thug\nEven my Kool-Aid jug's plated in gold\nI'm faded and blowed\nMy life savings, made it in shows\nAnd lost it on my way to Jerz, 'cause I paid it in tolls\nSo you can kiss my hairy bean bag\nFUCK the nation\nJust twist ya favorite *titty* nipples to my radio station\nBecause I say what I mean and do what I say\nI had a mind of my own but weed blew it away\nAnd now my lyrics got the parents all disgusted and heated\nBecause I'm nastier than airplane food and those that eat it\nI'm never forgotten (Unh!)\nJust rotten straight to the core\nUp in ya telly with that wet towel up under the door\nSo need I say more?\nI'm just your neighborhood whore\nWit Coronas and blunts\nThe size of some 4x4s\nPeople claimin' that they comin' to my side of the South\nBut they ventriloquists and talkin' out the side of they mouth\nSo the bullets I'm slidin' 'em out\nAnd the criminals hidin' em out\nAnd they all wanna come in the hood and try to make good but a nigga's guidin' 'em out\nSo all these other phony rappers keep your heads to the sky\nBecause I'm ruining it for everyone\nThey wish I'd just diiiieee (Where them horns at?)\n(Dun dun dun dun da-dunnn!)"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWe will be here forever, do you understand? (Black man)\nForever & ever, & ever & ever\n\n[Verse 1: Redman]\nHey\nThis black man made it in America\nBasketball and rapper, track kids to get the hell out the area\nNowadays niggas kill when you get ahead of 'em\nSo I backtrack to get 'em to act right\n'Cause they confuse the rap life for a trap life (True)\nMentally i ain't the rap type, you fuck with me your situation turn to Roy Jones' last fight\nThis muddy music, that means you get offended, these words like liquor when I'm bartending (Let's go nigga)\nMomma taught me well, she hold a hammer for me\nShe pray for me when I get it, it's mandatory (Mandatory)\nCall me Big Unc' and I'll cosign ya\nBankrolls, rolling blunts, I'll be ya role model\nDrug addicts go cold chicken\nThey veins pop out, they say \"Red, feed me what I ain't getting\"\nI can get in my car and out\nAnd the same song is on when I get back in and get out\nCheck my archives, my stage show is barfight\nYou want it? Had it right, Sean Price\nI'm a legend, don't call me old school\nI move niggas like they building in the whole foods (Yessir)\nAnd you gotta be ready for drama\nEspecially when bloods and. crips is living by your momma\nI'm breathless\n\n[Chorus: Pressure]\nReality sneaking to my baby\nLike John Jerry man I bust it from the eighties\nDem free [?]\nBlack in America, yeah, don't play me\n[?]\nRevolution kick off like in the '80\nDem free [?]\nBlack in America, yeah, just pay me\n\n[Verse 2: Redman]\nHey\nThis black man made it in America\nFacts\nMy blood kill lab rats, I'm one like a snowflake\nAbstract, that's why I take you to that Mad Max\nAnd I grew up across from a cemetery\nThat's why my commentary sound like your obituary\nGrown man talk, we got a Denzel on, I told LL I'm just getting warmed\nThe tri state, when niggas dying over bullets or they prostate\nAnd cops against blacks never gon' migrate\nI ain't getting shot, they try to pull me over? I turn it to a car chase\nThese little kids into gang violence\nArtists getting called hip hop but they ain't rhyming\nY'all voted for him, now they a rockstar\nI feel like a black film tryna get a Oscar\nGod forgive me for my sins\nYou dealt me these cards so I'm gon play it to win (Yeah)\nAnd I'm tryna get forty more haters\nSo I can sign em on to the \"Reggie, I Hate Him But Glad He Made It\"\nI'm breathless\n\n[Chorus: Pressure]\nReality sneaking to my baby\nLike John Jerry man I bust it from the eighties\nDem free [?]\nBlack in America, yeah, don't play me\n[?]\nRevolution kick off like in the '80\nDem free [?]\nBlack in America, yeah, just pay me\n\n[Verse 3: Redman]\nHey\nThis black man made it in America\nCan you believe how I did it?\nI had faith and had God as my witness\nI couldn't just be a artist, I had to learn the business\nAnd haters on the side, they had to sell me wolf tickets\nBut I'm still relevant, me and rap? We got a life sentence\nSuccess is like a bank loan, it's hard to get\nI worked hard for everything I wasn't offered in\nAnd it's up to me to show my babies how to be a boss\nI teach em how to win but also how to take a loss\nAnd education is key\nBut nowadays I advise you to learn the trade and not depend on a college degree\nI sold drugs but I don't have no story to tell\nCause music always was my life, Patti LaBelle\nAs long as I live, you get honour and dedication\nAnd fuck the media interrogating\nI'm breathless\n\n[Outro]\nYou see it on the news, you see it on social media\nBut when you a black man in America\nIt's VERY scary and terrifying, believe me\nSometimes I wonder, will there ever be quality for a black man in America\nI doubt it"

You know my name I wear cool kicks sounding like he's\nReady!\nYeah my name is Reggie!\nReady!\nReggie!\n\n[VERSE 2]\nOne, two, one, two fuck you mic checker\nChain so heavy can't hold my neck up\nDope flow, no bow, push it like Pepa\nFiends get hooked, by 10 get an extra\nExtra! Read all about it, my pen got callus\nThrow on cologne, I don't shower\nI connect like internet with no router\nShit, we feel we the best like Khaled\nOpposite of average, dig it\nI pimp my flow, so the whole west coast can exhibit (Xzibit)\nTurn it, shift it, routine till I'm clear\nLike, American Gangster bootleg\nOn board like Lupe, jump on\nYour whole career might change in one song\nThat's right, boy you can buy it\nFor 5 more thou you can have the sheets to outline it\nI'm sort of caniving, in a good way\nLike telling you \"Fuck you, have a good day!\"\nI walk this way, one pants leg rolled up\nNigga, I rep AJ"
