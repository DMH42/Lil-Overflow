  "plain": "Cordae Amari Dunston (b. August 26, 1997), known professionally as Cordae (formerly Entendre and YBN Cordae), is an American rapper and former YBN affiliate from Raleigh, North Carolina. He began to gain traction from his \u201cMy Name Is\u201d remix that gained over two million views on WORLDSTARHIPHOP in two weeks. His next track \u201cOld Niggas\u201d was a response to J Cole\u2019s \u201c1985\u201d and gained major traction, gathering 3 million views on Worldstar in just under a week.\n\nCordae released three mixtapes under his old alias between 2014-17, and joined a collaborative mixtape with the YBN crew in late 2018. His debut album, The Lost Boy, was released on July 26, 2019.\n\nOn August 14, 2020, Cordae dropped the YBN from his name, now being just Cordae."

I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes\nI know the shit you goin' through the last month\nYou stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt\nA nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk\nYou can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch\nUh, ramen noodles on the regular\nAdd some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch\nPeanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, etcetera\nAnd we just flyin' in the nebula\n\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt's gon', it'll be alright\n\n[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]\nI done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'\nFinally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment\nOut South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman\nRoundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul\nConfused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place\nSome of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase\nI know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm a fireplace\nI had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste\nI promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates\nThey used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape\nDo that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid\nDon't ever think it's sweet, that's that cr\u00e8me de la br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nWho they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy\nMy wifey yellin', \"Who they?\" My daughter yellin', \"Hooray\"\nI see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky\nI keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye\nLike a stye (Uh)\n\n[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]\nSo don't you shed a tear\n'Cause there'll be better years\nI live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear\nGod cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears\nThe feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here\n'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means\nA young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things\nAge 13, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans\nYou know they a little extra faded around the knees\nWith the grass stains in 'em\nI really wish a little extra cash came in 'em, 'cause a nigga really needed it\nPain, I defeated it, and brought back\nSoul survivor, nigga, what you call that?\n\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt's gon', it's gon' be alright\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby\nIt'll be alright"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nDamn, Mizzy Mauri got beats\n\n[Verse]\nUh, old niggas and new niggas, now what's the difference?\nAll in the same boat in a stuck position\nSo when an old nigga talkin' I don't fuckin' listen\nThey don't know, every day we make tough decisions\nIt seems though we is at a generational gap\nWhich bring conversation and a statement in fact\nWe can agree, none of us is 'posed to make it in rap\nI understand both sides, let me break it in half\nLet's take it back: when hip hop originated\nAnd old niggas said it was wack, they couldn't take it\nAnd called it a lil' trend, said it wouldn't last\nNow, it's the number one genre as the time passed\nYoung niggas won't listen and we know it, ha\nBut old niggas always talk and never show it, uh\nYou gotta practice what you preach and the classes that you teach\nWe'll eventually listen, my mind mentally prison, uh\nLately, all my idols, they been failin' me\nCatchin' sexual assaults and some felonies\nThen, you want me to listen what you tellin' me\nAnd wanna hate when we sing our lil' melodies\nAnd other idols, they be broke, get your funds in order\nAnd Kanye West is a Trump supporter\nThen, we got R. Kelly and Bill Cosby\nWho still probably got lil' girls in the Hills lobby\nAnd these supposed to be our heroes? Negro, please\nOld niggas unreliable like D-Rose knees\nOnly man I can trust is G-O-D\nNot to mention Mos Def and Talib Kweli\nNow I get it, y'all think new niggas really suck\nAnd white kids fuckin' love it, lil' silly ducks\nBut I know it's a lot of bullshit goin' on\nI understand, but please, don't complain without a plan\nIronically I wrote this whole song off a xan, nah I'm playin'\nI'm just tryna be a fuckin' man\nWe see you old niggas as a lot of clowns\nNot to mention, our father figures was not around\nSo we all on tours and we hoppin' towns\nWe just need to sit down and find common ground\nAnd it's soon to come, soon to come\nHip-hop need balance like the moon and sun\nIt feel good when I wear Christian Louboutins\nSo I gotta drop music to accrue some funds\nAnd I get it, that's the mindset that's killin' the rhyme-fest\nBut feedin' our families, lowering the crime, yet\nYou want us to be separate and make a contest\nRappin' to stay up out the streets, shouldn't mind that\nStayin' out of prison and we sayin' fuck the system, man\nRappin' is an outlet to go and get our dividends\nRather than out robbin' niggas, sellin' Ritalin\nOld niggas bitter, y'all should love it when a nigga win\n'Cause we came from the same struggle\nLike Diddy and Dame Russell\nWas teachin' and gained hustle, got rich, remained subtle\nSee, I listen, see, I listen\nBut Lil Dae-Dae water-whippin' in the kitchen\nReady to flip a pack and bring it back, no submission\nGotta just go attack Lil Pump when you're dissin'\nI understand both sides of the Ziploc\nY'all old niggas' time is comin', nigga, tick-tock\nI'ma still wear all my Gucci flip-flops\nAnd the fuckin' diamond chain with the big rocks\nAnd I'll be the greatest ever, nigga, just watch\nCardi B got rich from Love & Hip Hop, haha"

Tryna stay all intact\nFightin' all my demons, they be schemin' but I'm crawlin' back\nAnd eventually flyin', lately been mentally cryin'\nNiggas resentin' me, I am not for the industry lyin'\n\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae & Pusha T]\nLife's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale\nDo you love me? I can barely tell\n'Cause I'm up and down, been all around, nobody's callin' now\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nUh, 'cause I know what I been through\nBut I still, uh, I'd do it all over again\nAnd my life is so sinful (YBN, why be them?)\nBut through times, uh (King Push)\nThe good guys always win\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nI can tell you how I first started in this rap shit\n8th grade, backflippin' on the mattress\n9th grade, pack doin' gymnastics\n10th grade, somersaultin' all them crack flips\nAsterisk, skipped school, recorded with The Neptunes\nWe was makin' high school classics\nBefore I took a kilo and I wrapped it, I rapped it\nAround the funeral with the casket (Yuugh!)\nCoke avalanche, like a landslide\nOnly grew my hair this long because my man died\nCollect calls on them landlines, I pressed 5\nTo tell about the new test drive and talk fly, ooh\n\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nLife's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale\nDo you love me? I can barely tell\n'Cause I'm up and down, been all around, nobody's callin' now\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nUh, 'cause I know what I been through\nBut I still, uh, I'd do it all over again\nAnd my life is so sinful\nBut through times, uh\nThe good guys always win"

with a chip on my shoulder\nLooking at the competition, all these niggas is older\nOnly got two favorite rappers, Jigga and HOVA\nI'm sipping the soda, Lamborghini equipped with a motor\n'Till I hopped in the fast lane, reminiscing my past pains\nCarry it, the cash came, heritage from my last name (Uh)\nI'm from a tribe of brilliance, I buy the building\nPlease hide the children, I'm 'bout to go on a killing spree\nKnow you feeling me, got these rap poems, soliloquies\nWife, I really need, these hoes a bunch of Billy Jeans\nFake ass niggas, snake ass niggas\nRapping fast but \"What the fuck did you say?\" ass niggas\nType imported with Michael court in, your life distorted\nThe best nigga out of the league since Michael Jordan\nPlotting what I'm 'bout to accomplish, quite enormous\nI don't have to write to forfeit, my nigga my life a story\nCall Spike Lee, tell him how I made it off of type beats\nI might be the nicest with the handles since Kyrie\nRookie vet, came in the game, just took the check\nBodying everything that I do, my nigga look at Flex\nShoutout to my nigga Joey, court side at the Brooklyn Nets\nTold him I need a ticket, you gotta be specific\nMy nigga, I bleed terrific and piss excellence\nMy shit heaven sent, flowing like a sick veteran\nThe difference between me and you\nMultiply your self worth by five trillion\nYour high ceilings still couldn't equal two\nFraction of my worst shit, find your purpose\nBut while my verses, you can learn something, go soul searching\nNow watch me spend these Benjamin Franklins\nLike what this nigga be

penny stopper\nYou can keep your Balenciaga's, got plenty drama\nMan, I'm fiending like twenty mamas\nI'm barely rich, man, I still eat at Benihana\nI'ma need like ten Rihanna's\nPost commentary to all my niggas in solitary\nMy bitch bad like Halle Berry\nWe be making movies like Tyler Perry\nShit kinda scary, my God\nWhy you got to be so bashful\nShawtie wanna hit my phone with a hassle (Huh)\nI ain't tryna raise no Rascals\nCopped a new crib, shit look like a castle (Ayy)\nGetting them coins (Uh), Filet the steak, I ain't eating sirloins (Uh)\nBaby come join (Uh), I'm getting this money, I won't\nSo fortunate, proportionate\nLost Boy, nigga, no coordinates\nRemember Christmas, we was giftless\nThree foot tree, no ornaments\nPull my dick out, hoes swarming it\nFlow cold, nigga no warming it\nMama couldn't afford AAU, so we couldn't hoop, nigga no tournaments\nNow I'm with my nigga Ben Simmons plus ten women, I been winning\nMe and you, it's a big difference\nNaw for real, now listen Flex, ayy\nYou ain't dealing with no amateur\nTwo toned drip might damage ya\nHit a nigga quick, no camera\nI do not think you could handle us\nWhy they in the streets so scandalous?\nRap niggas dumb, don't plan enough\nLet me tell you how I ran it up\nSix months, live with my manager\nI was down bad on my ass, with no cash in the bag, now I'm finally manning up\nTryna get a sack, boy I'm the quarterback on my team like my last name Manning, bruh\nKnow what that mean?\nIf that bitch bad, get in between\nHer pussy wetter than aquamarine\nMade that ho sing, Adam Levine (Uh)\n\n[Interlude 2: YBN Cordae & Funkmaster Flex]\nYeah, yeah\nHold it bruh\nKeep it rolling\nWe rolling (Uh, huh)\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Part III: Kick, Push]\n\n[Intro: YBN Cordae &

(Yeah)\nSubmit FunkFlex.com if you can spit like YBN Cordae (Yeah)\nI'm not sure if you can, but if you can send it to me\nCome on\nYou got another one?\nLet's do it, come on let's play (Let's go)\nIf you got another one, I got another one (Let's do it)\nLet's go, let's do it\nUh, man I love the diversity\nFlex, yeah, yeah\nOh, this why I came up here 'cause y'all play great beats (Who?)\nFor real, haha, ayy\n\n[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]\nI'm still searching on the path that I'm headed beyond\nOne thing I had to learn was never question a don\nWhat is life to a king and what is death to a pawn?\nWhen I was twelve I got baptized and read the Quran\nSearching for purpose, answers\nLocked up for murdering verses\nStan, I heard you was nervous but that's my manners\nGrew up in Carolina but was raised by the panthers\nMoved to Maryland, mama used to work at the Sheraton (Uh)\nOne bed room apartment, it was so embarrassing\nHard times will humble the soul and lower arrogance\nRaised in the trenches with robbers, it's no samaritans\nNo charity, you niggas confused, it's no clarity\nCrystal clear diamonds from Africa, just imported\nI realized with money that vanity is less important\nFeeling like LeBron with plans of catching Jordan\nPlotting on a billi, ways to invest the fortune\nLet me switch the topic for you niggas that's getting brolic\nIf you kicking knowledge, I'll make a scholar revisit college\nDropped out and told professor, \"Kiss my ass\"\nNow I'm heading to the studio to diss my class\nLet me bring it back a second for all of my adolescence\nAm I the dopest out? My nigga, why is that a question?\nCompetition is nonexistent, was born the greatest\nMy parents fornicated but that shit's a normal basis\nGave birth to a king, wasn't a cloud in the sky\nTo all of the motherfuckers who would doubt, it's a lie\nSo remember this like it was in the Book of Genesis\nI reminisce days when love was real and all the infinite\nTired of the fake shit, back to the basics\nYour favorite rapper's favorite, somebody had to say it\nWas caught up in the Matrix, almost lost joint\nNow, y'all motherfuckers go and cross The Lost Boy\nNigga"

It's always trouble in Gotham\nIf he stutter, they robbin', we catch the shuttle to Harlem\nMakin' plays like Hudls, it's no rebuttals, they solid\nThe code from the OGs, the Jordan, the Kobes\nI be studying game, get the score from the nosebleeds\nWhen you tourin', exploding, its more important than voting\nLittle niggas getting killed and now we forced to be toting\nCuz I done lost some lil' homies, couple cousins, it's crazy\nA lil' brother straight bustin', now he stuck with a baby\nAnd he like fuck it it's gravy, it's just another occasion\nWas some luck that gone save him, but shit he stuck on probation\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's just another day in the life\nWhen you raised in the trife\nNow I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions\nLay awake in the night\nGotta pray to get right\nIn the shade gettin' high like I had to get it\n\n[Verse 2]\nMade a couple transactions, felt fantastic\nThat retail therapy is just a scam tactic\nA new wave of new slaves to the brand package\nBoy my gas be supreme, not a damn jacket\nI ran rapid, sheep niggas with lamb habits\nCollege kids doin' xans, acid, and cram classes\nProcrastinate on exam passes and slam asses\nFast forward, my fans massive, my plans mastered\nSpeakin' from experience, I seen from these lames\nYour potential isn't tapped, where will it even begin\nMy whole team gon' be eatin', don't mind feedin' my friends\nCuz dog, I'd rather be in meetings, fuck tweetin' a trend\nOn the outside strong but I'm bleedin' within\nI know you tired of all the cryin' and the grievin' the sin\nGod gave LeBron height and blessed me with a pen\nA real nigga but most of all, a leader of men\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's just another day in the life\nWhen you raised in the trife\nNow I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions\nLay awake in the night\nGotta pray to get right\nIn the shade gettin' high like I had to get it"

Everything ain't what it seems\nWhat's life without friends who remain genuine?\nDon't care about the money or what type of crib you in\nWho can withstand the test of time? As it's a guess of mine\nHere in real life homie, this is not a set design\nNot on TV screens or the magazine covers\nSitting and observing as the travesty flutters\nWhy we gotta beef shit, I'd rather be brothers\nTrips to Tokyo with some Japanese lovers\nLost boy in this world full of hatred and greed\nSee a young nigga make it what they hating to see\nNever complacent I be on the chase for the cream\nCash rules everything but you facing a king\nLet's step up to this parliament, every fucking bar legit\nI know you in denial like an alcoholic father is\nHold up let me pause a bit, nobody is as raw as this\nWord to Jesus Christ I hope nobody ever cross the kid\nDamn, yes men of the main Judas\nBut I will remain as true as my problems I aim through it\nThis that thought-provoking that leave you lost and hopin'\nVoices in my head be lying so my heart has spoken\nRap niggas far from potent, they just out here saying random shit\nHad to drop a classic 'cause I heard they was demanding it\nAnxiety is damaging, but what's the pressure?\nMake that shit that's from the soul but with a touch of effort\nNothing lesser; real love, it ain't nothing better\nI swear I need that real love, it ain't nothing better\nSee what's life without purpose? What's life without verses?\nLost boy in this shit, what's life without churches?\nWhat's life without belief? What's life without goals?\nWhat's life without me? What's me without soul?\nMy God\n\n[Outro]\nI said I think I do better\nI said I think I do better"

   "lyrics": "I swear hate you but I love you the same\nYou help ease my troubles help me go through the pain\nAnd if it were not for you I'd be goin insane\nBut for real you need to stay in your lane\nI mean I love so much I be eyeing you out\nAnd when my lips touch yours I fly high in the clouds\nAnd you always wake the neighbors baby you just to loud\nBut you always calm me down that's why I keep around\nBut it's time for change where our paths will criss cross\nYou made me fail that drug test baby I'm pissed off conservative big boss\nYou know my persona\nWhy you always on my sack girl that is a honor\nI mean I'm gon off the ganja\nGirl you powers are magical\nAnd the statement that I'm leavin you is honestly laughable they different view you show you me of the world is impractical\nCause honestly exposure is a trait I'm attracted to\nBut a change is needed and you know it's truth\nBut becausethat's the one thing that's more potent than you\nMember when we was alone\nAnd I would flow in the booth\nThe inspiration you gave it made show and improve\nAnd for that I'm so thankful, and you know that grateful\nAnd if everyone tried the world wouldn't be hateful\nBut you got your own faults it ain't no lying at sin\nYou fuckin up my community kids try you at 10\nNow let's try this again 2nd time we round the troops\nYour impact is amazing ppl die for a ounce of you\nYou even make em try a hash tag but I'm pounding you\nBut damn the way you the make us go crazy astounding boo but you always got benefits\nYou making my niggas rich\nAnd quite a few go to jail for you so you split in it\nMember days we'd be getting kicking it\nWe'd be watching the stars line\nYou even let start to sell you out through the hard times\nNever let me go broke\nI kept bread in my pocket\nSo i stop the using you and I used you profit\nAnd for that I'm so sorry was no reason for shopping you\nI kept believe I pimped my main girl to a prostitute\nBut you make niggas rob and shoot\nAnd you ended a block or 2\nAnd you limit potential you make me wonder what I could do you make some grow addicted so it ain't nomo stopping through\nCause me in blowing in this rap shit is not optional\nSo girl we threw\nSorry I got to do this\nAnd if I choose it you know my choice is the music\nSo I'm saying goodbye you just apart of my old life\nI knew for a couple years, knew rap for my whole life"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Malcolm X]\nFor instance, the average so-called Negro, he doesn't think that he can go into business and provide jobs for himself\nAnd because of this, he thinks that he can only get a job from the White man\nOr he can only get clothes from the White man, or he can only get food from the White man\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, we're takin' over the the racist motive, the hatred's older\nThe empire's retired, I'm just an ageist Yoda\nGet some powder and baking soda, don't take the culture\nThey flip faster than racing motors. I'm made to blow up\nIf you don't understand now, then you will later\nI'm from a place where they bust Glocks and steal paper\nNah, I'm talking assassination, they kill mayors\nBut can't overtake me because my skill's greater\nRap politician. Nominate my Congress\nNever understood the Obama-hating nonsense\nBlack president. Dog, you hever had an option\n'Cause, boy, I go monster way better than the Loch Ness\nLet's get back to the subject: Blacks in the public\nIt seems like all other rap doesn't touch it\nSee, I tend to be the industry's redheaded stepchild\nI've spoken too much. I'm surprised I'm not dead now\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause they got dead bodies in the street\nNiggas on a leash\nFacts show they want us all diseased\n'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground\nNiggas, not a sound\nThe cameras and the lights come around\nBut I've always wondered (I wonder)\nYeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)\nIf we'll ever make it\nShit that we're facing\nThese rap politicians\nThe game is getting basic\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou see, these rap politicians are really something else\nThey start blowing all their funds moment they discover wealth\nI mean, cop another belt. Shit, maybe even two\n'Cause if you're not wearing designer, then crazy, you\nWhen actuality, these guys are lazy goofs\nThey're the type to go dap a Piru in baby blue\nStraight stupid. And these are the niggas who make music\nInfluence a generation, nobody relates to it\nNigga, now you see the problem? Do you see the trouble?\nThey're fucking up our brains for generational struggles\nThat black waitress works doubles just to get by\n'Cause her son needs some Jordans, dog, just to get fly\nI used to smoke an eighth a day, nigga, just to get high\nAnd Nelqueisha didn't get the job that Jessica got\nAnd when we get the 9 to 5s, we become satisfied\nAmend the rap politics. Constitution ratified\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause they got dead bodies in the street\nNiggas on a leash\nFacts show they want us all diseased\n'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground\nNiggas, not a sound\nThe cameras and the lights come around\nBut I've always wondered (I wonder)\nYeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)\nIf we'll ever make it\nShit that we're facing\nThese rap politicians\nThe game is getting basic\nYeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's time to overthrow this government. Military coup\n'Cause if we don't soon, they'll still bury you\nAnd the first plan of action: Man, y'all gotta stop the shooting\nAnd no dickriding, that's technically prostitution\nNo backwards progression, always constant movement\nEverything is in your hands, you just gotta grind to do it\nBut first things first needs diplomatic correction\n'Cause rappers like me in the systematic oppression\nHuey Newton of this rap shit. Y'all don't understand me\nThe same reason why Nas and Snoop still don't have a Grammy\nWhy you gotta blow thousands when you fly to Miami?\nAnd why you can't be a rapper if you drive in a Camry?\nThey make it uncool to budget, want us blowing our cash\nThen Uncle Sam makes us broke again when taking our tax\nSo depressed from this hex they supply in prescriptions\nModern day drug war, these rappers fighting addiction\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause they got dead bodies in the street\nNiggas on a leash\nFacts show they want us all diseased\n'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground\nNiggas, not a sound\nThe cameras and the lights come around\nBut I've always wondered (I wonder)\nYeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)\nIf we'll ever make it\nShit that we're facing\nThese rap politicians\nThe game is getting basic\nYeah\n\n[Outro: YBN Nahmir]\nListen, man, I ain't gonna lie, this shit is ass\nThis shit is not good\nI need some coonery in my life\nI'm tired of this black power, woke shit\nAight? You gonna have to cut all that shit out, B\nSeriously, I needs the crank\nYes, that's what I'm looking for, the word \"crank\"\nI needs that\nThat is not this\nThis shit is ass. Turn it off\nNot a good song (Ass)\nTrash (Garbage)\nGarbage (Boo-boo, stank-stank)\nNigga Motherfuckin'"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThe reason why black people are so addicted to materialism is, we use materialism to vicariously add wealth to ourselves\nIn other words, I don't think much of me. I ain't nobody. But if I put these Air Jordans on, I will be\nIf I buy this house in a white suburb, I will be. You understand? If I get this white woman, I will be\nIf I get this Louis Vuitton bag, I will be. So, we use wealth to replace self-worth\n\n[Verse 1]\n'Kay, some may think I'm insane. Just a sprinkle of brain\nI'm on the brink of a change. Clearly the underdog, but the dude is winning\nI'm onto new beginnings. Race and just choose your engine\nAnd living confused with sinning\nI done got some problems. Trying to save this Gotham\nNiggas robbing and killing, but it's up to me to stop them\nBut it drives me insane. Niggas grimy and slimy\nSo find me a change. I'd rather buy me a Range\nBut I've been removed from popping tags. I'd rather cop a Jag\nDamn, can't stop the swag. Open gates, lock 'em back\nGot us all in prison. Income from writtens\nFlow is so persistent, but the fame got me tripping\nI done moved past the shoes, bags, the waves and do' rags\nYour wave is due past. It's over, was too dragged\nNever on a newcast in cars that move fast\nSave up, don't lose cash to working for two sacks\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars\nDesigner clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar\nNever been fronting. All come from nothing\nGetting them checks, you expect I'm stunting\n'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars\nDesigner clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar\nNever been fronting. All come from nothing\nGetting them checks, you expect I'm stunting\n\n[Verse 2]\nI dreamed of earning mega millions, least a hundred or two\nPenthouse apartment with just a wonderful view\nCameras flashing, paparazzi always front of the news\nGold chains and lots of Jordans, I'll have bundles to choose\nI want diamonds and watches and straight shining on carpet\nAnd my Bugatti, I park it. Issey Miyake my closet\nAnd this money that I'm making, I'm gon' show it off\nOdd are, couple years, I'm gon' blow it all\nCan't resist the urge to spend. My problems are worsening\nI'm going to church to sin. Please close the curtaining\nYour whole life's been open, explain the pipe you're smoking\nPlus, like the pills you're popping, the way to deal has got 'em\nStraight up going insane. It ain't flowing the same\nIt seems like y'all start to change with the hoes and the fame\n'Cause a nigga got some dollars, gotta change up my homies\nStraight become a new person, while forgetting the old me\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars\nDesigner clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar\nNever been fronting. All come from nothing\nGetting them checks, you expect I'm stunting\n'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars\nDesigner clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar\nNever been fronting. All come from nothing\nGetting them checks, you expect I'm stunting\n\n[Verse 3]\nFuck family, fuck friends. All I want is designer\nFuck a peace of mind and conscience with my leather recliner\nFuck attention and a Grammy, all I want is the dollars\nFuck being a role model, all I want is the sponsors\nSad that I sold my soul for money, the hoes and gold\nI'm stressed and blowing dope because the Holy Ghost\nMade the wrong decision, like the longest living\nBut got the strongest vision, clouded by thongs on women\nBut I know all these vices. Gotta stay enlightened\nWith the fame, I won't change. I'mma beat it, I'mma fight it\nBlowing up the first year, talking 'bout the birth year\nBecoming what I hate, a false prophet, that's my worst fear\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars\nDesigner clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar\nNever been fronting. All come from nothing\nGetting them checks, you expect I'm stunting\n'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars\nDesigner clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar\nNever been fronting. All come from nothing\nGetting them checks, you expect I'm stunting\n\n[Outro]\nNigga, you just wait 'til I come up, nigga\nY'all- Y'all think I'm playing, like it's a joke or something?\nWhen you see me come around in that Bentley truck and I'm fucking shit up\nYou're gonna want to ride with me\nWhen you see me step out the car, huh, but let's see how I could run this\nHuh, $500 on my ass\nHuh, 700 on my feet\nUh, these niggas is cheap\nI'm talking V.V.S. down to the motherfucking toe\nI'm talking 'bout motherfucking 6 karat for the pinky ring, nigga"

Other than that, I'm in good shape. [applies aftershave; pretends to scream]"

Mind's lurking, that's the hurt I'm on\nRappers don't want beef, eat that sirloin\nWhat's that steak in my fate in my verbal throne\nNo pun intended, a nigga was born to run the business\nAccount balances always tellin me my funds is spending\nTryna have a beach house, invite tons of women\nDive in a water slide, ain't no fun in swimming\nAnd you know they from exotic places\nBlack and white girls, man I'm not a racist\nA house so big couldn't find a basement\nWe tryna move up but we climb adjacent\nPreviously these goals is just manifested\nCause right now my pockets looking anorexic\nGot a vision for my future that my plans are hectic\nNigga, mass appeal"

   "lyrics": "Yeah, Uh\n\nLet me tell you about a young nigga, been through it all\nAnd let me tell you about a dumb nigga, witness his fall\nBoth had similar beginings, both was getting involved\nBut both couldn't be different how they finished it off\nSee to start with the first nigga, name was Raymond\nDrug dealer, dope boy damn his chain was hanging\nDrove a Lex, bitches Hex (?) Did his thang from slanging\nPlus a nigga kept his steel and his range was stainless\nMove rocks from 9-1 til 2002\nVegas Nights going crazy even found him a boo\nHit the club 50 deep, was surrounded with troops\nNever lacked ( ... ) (....) to you, Everything was well plotted\nPlanned it all in advance, got fronted his first brick\nStarted off with a chance, put his homeboy on, watch who you calling ya mans. Cause niggas snakes tell the jakes(?) til it fall out of his hands\n\nWatch the jealous niggas too\nYeah the ones with greed\nThe ones who watched you starve\nThe ones you feed\nThe ones you always give but always need\nYou gotta.. cut them off and watch them bleed\nAnd these are all wise words, these are laws of power\nNever listen to the words from the jaws of cowards\nCuz these niggas tell lies that are as tall as towers\nWhere the weak dont eat and the small devoured\n\nYou see Raymond learned these things in the earliest stage\nFrom ATL to New York, Niggas heard of his rage\nHe growing mad with dollars, gucci collar, fendi , prada\nNigga fall in love with designer\nBlowing cash real fast, never building a savings\nStart to hit a couple licks, even steal from the Haitians\nComing back on top, making bills and them payments\nBut its only temporary, brother killed on the pavement\nNow his eyes is open, growing wiser, start to stack his bread, a soul survivor\nBut his karma coming bold and proper\nHeres the key to the safe what he told Elijah\nRemember what i said before, watch who you calling your brother\nThe same niggas that you trusted make you fall in the gutter\nElijah had his own plan, he wasn't a grown man, traded stocks with the enemy, robbed his own (...)?\n\nCalled Raymond, crying and pleading, couldn't believe him\nStole from his own homie, damn.. Really deceived him\nBut nah Raymond not mad, that nigga calm and collective\nKicked Elijah out the gang, took his charm and his necklace\nSee he thought Raymond was lacking, but was given a test\nBut he failed.. two shots and got hit in his vest\nWe dont tolerate the rats, we get'n rid of the pest\nHad to sacrifice, the brooks life, legitimate chest\nThats how you gotta approach it, we never hide and we focus\nBut we posted on the block like Thompson & Bogut\nSee he tryna get out the game and have a early retirement\nWasted talent but he's just a product of his environment\nNot to mention the tension, visits (?) is getting so tiring\nKnowing he could be next, his brother's death is inspiring (?)\nTime expiring, quickly gotta think of a plan\nCause feds tapping , kidnapping getting linked to his camp\nNiggas banging on the door, notice the blink and the lamps\nThey was plotting and scheming, yeah the robbers and demons\nAnd everyday is someone thats on his property gleamin\nBut you know his AK is always properly beamin\n\nTired of living this shit and straight sick of this life\nPlus he a grown man now, he got a kid and a wife\nAnd had a lil rough start but now he getting it right\nSigns from god overbearing, peep the flickering lights\nSo he saved a lump some, still collecting his royalty\nKnow the game is so fake and niggas they lack loyalty\nIn chains called the cop? more important his lawyer fees\nThe livestyle he living it is getting so spoiling\nSo he had to man up, start making his boss move\nInvest in yourself cause dawg thats all you\nHe used to play with steel and using the raw tools\nBut he left the crack game and went in to law school"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI used to have big dreams, go international\nBut that was just me being dumb, so irrational\nI'm radical, I\u2019m lazy, I need to practice more\nAnd why everybody want to be rapping for\nAnd just plain disrespecting the art\nI recollect from my heart\nGuess the success, me in part\nStill wondering why no labels try to sign me yet\nAnd my rap, reject, for real, I want the respect\nAnd to be next\nBut I'ma get it and earn it\nI can admit that I'm learning, but I\u2019m jet, I deserve it\nNow that's just me being optimistic, I want it. I gotta get it\nAnd the doubters that tell me no, no they can't stop the vision\nAnd put a sock in it, and stuff it down their esophagus\nSwallow it until your screaming out, yeah like you was with us\nIntolerant of critics\nYou weren't putting in the work, you wouldn't get it, admit it\nImagine if you were spitting fire like a dragon or as fly as Aladdin\nBut everytime that you rapping, they say you're wack man\nThat's why they can't stand me, I do it for family\nRemember my haters, when I\u2019m winning the Grammy\n\n[Chorus]\nSee I\u2019ma make it, that's a guarantee\nSee me flying in the crowds, world, look at me\nWorld look at me\nWorld look at me\nWhoever said sky\u2019s the limit is an underachiever\nNow we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena\nWithout the Serena\nWithout the\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn these songs, I put my heart and my soul\nIt all start with a goal, I got the sharpest of flows\nIncrease your interest in music, it's worth listening to it\nAnd Nas is my biggest influence\nMaking rigorous music\nTryna bring rap back to it's regular days\nIt\u2019s never the same, since the '90's, it's changed\nFor better or for worse, forever, I'm cursed\nWith this gift to write rhymes without effort or work\nReading a veteran verse\nBut you just gotta put the work in or you're just worthless\nAnd you gotta have the courage to spit the verses\nAnd it also take perseverance\nAnd when they say it isn't worth the hearing, it just hurt the spirit\n\n[Chorus]\nSee I'ma make it, that's a guarantee\nSee me flying in the crowds, world, look at me\nWorld look at me\nWorld look at me\nWhoever said sky's the limit is an underachiever\nNow we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena\nWithout the Serena\nWithout the\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf Martin Luther had a dream, then I'ma spark the vision\nAnd you could understand more, if you start to listen\nWell that's a smart decision\nNo need to start a lecture\nThey say your rhymes are foreign, preface this like architecture\nOthers say I suck, like are you serious\nMr. Psycho flows, I'm better than you period\nAre you delirious, curious, how he get this good\nWell you can have some more rhymes, now I wish you would\nAnd it's amazing how he switch his flow and style up\nNow hopefully, he haters don't let the money pile up\nThey can't fit and make the Nile flood\nAnd before, we make the crowd nuts but\n\n[Chorus]\nSee I'ma make it, that's a guarantee\nSee me flying in the crowds, world, look at me\nWorld look at me\nWorld look at me\nWhoever said sky's the limit is an underachiever\nNow we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena\nWithout the Serena\nWithout the"
