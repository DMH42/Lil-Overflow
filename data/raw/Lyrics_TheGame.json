  "plain": "Jayceon Terrell Taylor was born November 29th, 1979 in Compton, California to two Crip-affiliated gang members. He grew up on Santana Blocc, a Crip-controlled neighborhood, with a large family of half and step siblings. He was hardened by a rough and violent childhood stinting from his parent\u2019s drug use, domestic violence, and family members being killed through gang-related conflicts.\n\nBy 2000, a 21-year-old Jayceon Taylor was a member of the Cedar Block Pirus, a Blood-affiliated gang, and dealt drugs on the streets of Compton.\n\nLate on the night of October 1st, 2001, Jayceon was alone in his apartment when the doorbell rang and after opening the door, he was jumped by three perpetrators:\n\nI flew back, one of the dudes had a gun. I was going for my gun so the biggest of the three ran for it. He got it first, we wrestled. And he just started firing. I was shot a couple times. I knew I was going to die because everyone I knew that got shot, they died. I closed my eyes and that\u2019s when the flash happened.\n\nThe intruders had fled the scene and Jayceon ended up with five gunshot wounds\u2014in the chest, stomach, and arms. Bleeding and unable to walk, he dialed 9-1-1 before passing out and was rushed to the emergency room. He remained unconscious for three days.\n\nThe whole incident gave him a new perspective and started his life down a different path. During his recovery, Jayceon would watch hip-hop music videos on BET:\n\nI remember starting to watch 106 & Park. I was just recovering from my gunshot wounds and Shyne was a rapper and he reminded me of myself. So I was like, \u2018If he can be a rapper, I think I can.\u2019 I started listening to all my old CDs. AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted was my favorite Ice Cube CD. Straight Outta Compton, N.W.A., Nas.\n\nThese albums became his curriculum and he proved a quick study. Jayceon was rapping about his life. He was still slinging drugs and writing those experiences into his rhymes.\n\nHe took the name Game, a nickname from his grandmother because she would say that he was \u201cgame for anything.\u201d Determined to make it in rap, he started honing his skills by freestyling on the streets of Compton and landed his first big break when he met J.T. The Bigga Figga at the West Coast Hip-Hip Summit in 2002.\n\nFive months after being shot, Game was in a recording studio laying his life experiences on tape. The recordings, later known as Untold Story, were released in March 2002 and, in a flash, Game had an underground buzz. He started by giving out the demo with drug deals and ended up shopping the CDs at local swap meets and mom-and-pop record stores. Eventually, radio DJs got ahold of his bootleg tracks:\n\nI just remember how good it felt for somebody to know me and acknowledge me. And tell me that something that I did was dope. You know, versus somebody wanting to kill me.\n\nAt the request of Aftermath CEO Dr. Dre, Mike Lynn was sent to pick up Game and bring him to meet the N.W.A. hip-hop legend:\n\nHe rolled down the window and was like, \u2018Which one of y'all is Game?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Me. Who wanna know?\u2019 He took me to meet Dre. I had just finished making crack. My shirt was stained, I had cocaine in my fingernails. There was Nate Dogg, and there was Snoop, and there was Busta Rhymes and Dre played my demo. And after the first song he cut it off and he was like, \u2018You wanna be down with Aftermath?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Hell yeah.\u2019 That was the beginning of the dream for me.\n\nAfter being signed to Aftermath/Interscope and paired with 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew, The Game released his debut studio album, The Documentary, on January 18th, 2005. The multi-platinum selling album was solely responsible for bringing West Coast hip-hop back into the mainstream since its peak in the 1990s and established Game as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nIn the years since his debut, Game has beefed with countless rappers from Joe Budden to Meek Mill but he was involved in one of hip-hop\u2019s biggest feuds: The Game vs. 50 Cent. The clash stemmed from 50 taking shots at Fat Joe, Nas, and Jadakiss, and accusing Game of being disloyal because he wouldn\u2019t get involved. In February 2005, during an interview on Hot 97, 50 Cent announced that Game was no longer a member of G-Unit.\n\nShortly after having a press conference and declaring a truce between the two, Game heard 50 taking jabs at him on a few mixtape tracks:\n\nI wanted to kill him, for real. And I thought there was a strong possibility that I would die. I just felt like me and 50 were the modern day 2Pac and Biggie. And I thought we would have the same outcome.\n\nRather than picking up a gun, the Compton emcee released \u201c300 Bars And Runnin',\u201d a 15-minute scathing diss record, where he aimed to completely end 50 Cent and G-Unit, while inadvertently starting the G-Unot movement:\n\nThere was a bar that said, \u2018You sell records but a G-G-G-U-not.\u2019 But all it was, was a metaphor, I didn\u2019t know what I created. Next thing I know, fans start yelling, \u2018G-G-G-U-not!\u2019 Started making T-shirts, the movement got bigger than me.\n\nAfter throwing his G-Unit chain into the crowd during a concert in New York, G-Unit\u2019s home turf, Game felt like he had won the war:\n\nThat was Operation: Kill G-Unit. It worked because G-Unit clothing, I started seeing that shit on sale everywhere. When crackheads start wearing G-Unit clothing, that\u2019s when I knew that I was successful.\n\nIn early 2006, after having parted ways with Aftermath/Interscope and his mentor, Dr. Dre, over the beef, Game went into a downward spiral with his personal and professional life:\n\nI ended up being all alone and just contemplating suicide. Thinking that after all that I had been through, this is what I\u2019m left with? This alone.\n\nProving to himself that he didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help, Game recorded and released his second album Doctor\u2019s Advocate on November 14th, 2006 without any input from Dr. Dre. The album spawned the smash hit \u201cIt\u2019s Okay (One Blood)\u201d and shot straight to the #1 spot on the Billboard charts:\n\nThe Doctor\u2019s Advocate will forever be my greatest album. Better than The Documentary to me. This solely on the fact that I did it all by myself.\n\nOn March 2nd, 2008, Game was sentenced to 60 days in jail. Alone with his thoughts, he channeled his emotions and wrote his next monster hit, \u201cMy Life,\u201d featuring New Orleans rapper Lil' Wayne for his third album, L.A.X.\n\nGame continued to release critically-acclaimed albums including the fan-named The R.E.D. Album, his first concept album, Jesus Piece, the sequel to his groundbreaking debut album, The Documentary 2/2.5, his ode to the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the year he first became a gang member, 1992, and his final album, Born 2 Rap, released on his 40th birthday. Being one of the driving forces keeping West Coast hip-hop alive, Game has represented and paid homage to California throughout his entire career."

   "lyrics": "[Intro: The Game]\nReal nigga shit\nOther night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB\nWe just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life\nPlayed some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nNiggas called me to set you up\nWant me to come and wet you up\n'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie\nHeard about the shit with Diddy\nSo I came through to vest you up\nAnd I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush\nA vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what\nI got L.A. unified\nYou better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us\nSee, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus\nNiggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up\nTax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money\nNigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus\nDawg, fame is a motherfucker\nDo a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth\nHow soon they forget?\nRun up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'\nHow are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?\nHeart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas\nDrake told me not to trust you niggas\nYour energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas\nJust walkin' 'round the crib like, \"Why a nigga can't live?\nGet this money, fuck these bitches though?\"\nThinkin' 'bout the beef like:\n\"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical\"\nThis my city, nigga, everybody know it\nRidin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound\nTucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up\n\n[Chorus: Drake & The Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid\nAll I ever asked is one\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nThank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'\nThank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors\nTo every single fuckin' function\nHad niggas tell me to my face how we were family\nAnd how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget\nNow, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny\nPeople been reachin' out to me\nAnd I'm on some straight unresponsive shit\nI would have so many friends\nIf I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments\nI would have so many friends\nIf I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments\nI would have all of your fans\nIf I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit\nI would have so many more friends\nIf I lost my success and my confidence\nI'm in the club every time that they play the competition\nIf they even play the competition and I seen the response they get\nYeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid\nMight go to Jamaica, disappear again\nMy circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself\n\n[Chorus: Drake & The Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid\nAll I ever asked is one\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nMiss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga\nHeld a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga\nIf he was still alive, he would kill niggas\nHe was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill\nNiggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though\nCan't think, so you roll up that indigo\nStressin' while drivin' down Figuero'\nBlowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn\nMake a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, \"Here it go\"\nScreamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though\nGuess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though\nYou niggas don't feel me though\nThat was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch\nYou dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though\nNot even to H-Town\nSo underground that I gotta be a trill nigga\nStrapped up from the waist down\nThat's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga\nShit was so simple when Henchman was out\nHe had a young nigga right there with Meech\nSo happy when Bleu Davinci got out\nWe came up on these California streets\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit\nGot a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?\nDon't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga\nAlways be a real nigga\nI never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga\n\n[Chorus: Drake & The Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid\nAll I ever asked is one"

Where the fuckin Ring Pops?\nYou got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox\nWolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected\nLike Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler)\nJesus, motherfucking Theresa\nThis nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature\nMy team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas\nGetting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah\nBishop Eddie caught me tryna escape\nBag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape\nDragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin\nFall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nWe are not the same, I am a Martian\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\n(Chuck, fuck wit' me) I do\nCause Lil Tunechi always bless me (achoo)\nHe killed me on my own track, so what? Not you\nFuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu\nI fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot\nI was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup\nThen I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe\nWith Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too\nWith Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too\nSo I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit\n(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do\nBut when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too\nAnd I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you\nNow I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu\nMad that DC comics overlooked me\nCause Captain America's straight pussy\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nWe are not the same, I am a Martian"

Then let 'em hate!\nBut I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nRecognize my life, ridicule my fight\nGive me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights\nIn the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write\nGet familiar with Cartwright, \u2018cause I want that shot\nI'm a raging bull when the needle drops\nFor the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop\nI'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'\nLet it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me\nIn the dark with the ghetto children\nLook at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about \"the West died\"\nCan't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside\nYou test me, you test God, I'm His son\nIt say in Psalms, you come at me\nThen I can split you with this Tommy gun\nYou won't have no time to run\nI'm from the Compton slums, and that's how the West ride\nI'm from the city where two of the best died\nRest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em\nDamn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em\nName your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em\nMatter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5\nGame, Biggie, Hov\u2026 probably Pac, Nas\nNo particular order, bet a mill' that I slaughter\nAnd serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered\nHow dare you niggas pop fly\nWhen I'm the nigga sold 5 mill out the gate and numbers do not lie\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nRecognize my life, ridicule my fight\nGive me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights\nIn the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write\nGet familiar with Cartwright, \u2018cause I want that shot\nI'm a raging bull when the needle drops\nFor the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop\nI'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'\nLet it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me\nIn the dark with the ghetto children\nLook at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic\nGave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package\nCame with LAX, since critics said it was average\nI was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and\nGeffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope\nSpill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke\nAnd this is what you all been waitin' for\nI'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door\nWhat the fuck y'all take me for?\nI love you \u2018cause you hate me more\nI'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84\nShake you like Haiti's floor\nWalk up on you, like, \"What's goin' on, baby boy?\"\nShots in that Mercedes door\nEither I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or\nCould that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?\nBut I still owe Jimmy one more album\nThe best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nRecognize my life, ridicule my fight\nGive me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights\nIn the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write\nGet familiar with Cartwright, \u2018cause I want that shot\nI'm a raging bull when the needle drops\nFor the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop\nI'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'\nLet it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me\nIn the dark with the ghetto children\nLook at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nKendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder\nSoldier, like a lieutenant\nAnd the coupe tinted, got pulled over\nJohnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well\nWe don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao\nLittle nigga Mayweather size\nRide like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar\n'Til the federal come through and raid ours\nReminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders\nWas in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome\nAnd I don't condone dickridin'\nI'm addicted to Westsidin'\nLivin' in a city where the skinny niggas die\nAnd the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion\nTryin'\u2026 and I mean that shit\nGame came through, put the city on his back\nI was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit\n\"Compton!\" \u2013 a nigga gotta scream that shit\nNever went commercial, never TV-screened that shit\nCan't block or screen that shit\nNow everybody sing that shit!\n\n[Outro]\nRed is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy it!"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: The Game]\nPunk-ass motherfucker, checkin' shit\nWhat you was gonna do?\nKill me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?\n2Pac, Biggie \u2013 shut the fuck up!\nFuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit\n(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)\nFuck you, nigga!\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nTake me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary\nTake me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley\nTake me away, like I overdosed on cocaine\nOr take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide\nI'm from a windy city like Do or Die\nFrom a block close to where Biggie was crucified\nThat was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason\nAnd you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?\n\u2018Cause that's Jesus, people \u2013 and Game, he's the equal\nHated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel\nYeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel\nLike I needed my father, but he needed a needle\nI need some meditation so I can lead my people\nThey askin', \"Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?\"\nAnd why every hood nigga feed off evil?\nAnswer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nWe are not the same, I am a Martian\nSo approach my Phantom doors with caution\nYou see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em\nAnd I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon\nSo eat this black music and tell me how it taste now\nAnd fuck Jesse Jackson, \u2018cause it ain't about race now\nSometimes I think about my life, with my face down\nThen I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile\nDamn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now\nAnd like M.J.B. no more drama now\nLivin' the good life, me and Common on common ground\nI spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town\nGot a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds\nMy life used to be empty like a Glock without a round\nNow my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nWalk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front\nWith the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts\nListenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards\nShootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice\nMy mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood\nI'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)\nMade my grandmother pray for good\nIt never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could\nAin't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood\nAnd it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood\nBut it's real niggas like me that make the hood\nRidin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should\nWith the top back, in my Sox hat\nI'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that\nEven if they brought the nigga Pac back\nI'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right?

She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in\nEvery time she think about me on the road\nShe be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been\nWell it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up\nThese other niggas try and fuck\nI'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up\nSo we fuck, say what? You ain't been home lately\nYou ain't heard that nigga? Her man left cause she cheated on his ass\nFound her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga\n(She burned that nigga)\nSay what? She burned that nigga (she burned that nigga)\nSay what? She burned that nigga\nDawg, she burned that nigga\nHe beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid\nAll cause a bitch burned that nigga\nNow dog, that's real ass shit\nThat's word around the ville ass shit\nDid you strap up? Did you the strap up?\nPlease tell me that you strapped up nigga\nWe could kill that bitch if you want to\nI'm cool, I strapped up, played by the rules, damn\nWhile I'm sittin' here blessed, she at the crib all alone and she stressed\nSo nigga I\n\n[Chorus: Game & J.

What happened then?\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI live this life at a pace that anyone can go\nKnow your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone\nTrace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones\nAnd I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew\nI bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag\nA car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass\nBut still I be feeling like none of my light never casts\nOut of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast\nBut fuck that, I'm not worried, even when it's scary\nSkrrt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry\nDirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone is burried\nShirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early\nI need you to keep quiet as a mouse\nWhich is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about\nI'm hearin the sonics of gun fire\nThe whispers, the silent cries\nEven though I know it's an eye for an eye\n\n[Chorus: Tank]\nI said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all\nYou want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk\nSay we on our way now, I'mma see you again\nAnd when they ask you questions, you just answer\nWhat happened then? What happened then?\n\n[Bridge: Tank]\nI was born a soldier, ride or die for mine\nTattooed tears and a lawyer, tried to give me life\nHeaven can you hear me? 'Cause I know that hell can\nSo heaven can you heal me? I'm only just a man, oh\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nYou want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there\nHub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here\nRespect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen\nColombian neck-ties on the outside from within\nAnd then, your momma never see you again\nCasket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh\nNiggas can\u2019t hear you talking from the sky\nAnd only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie\nKarma catches up to all you head honchos\n2 dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco\nShit get real though inside the Foxhills though\nNigga living that fast life and get killed slow\nAsk Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets\nMy grandmother\u2019s prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace\nLos Angeles, I\u2019m the motherfucking King here\nNo first 48 'cause muh'fuckers don\u2019t sing here, huh\n\n[Chorus: Tank]\nI said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all\nYou want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk\nSay we on our way now, I'ma see you again\nAnd when they ask you questions, you just answer\nWhat happened then? What happened then?"

   "lyrics": "[Verse]\nThis that sick rap, kick back, come to where I pitch at\nWhere bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack\nPresidential Rollie, nigga, where your wrist at?\nI can kill you in four bars, that's a Kit Kat\nDid the Lambo my way with a sick wrap\nSmooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back\nNo rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks\nCounting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack\nNigga I was on the bus with it\nHad 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt\nAndrew Luck with it\nWe had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it\nJay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it\nSigel would've loved it, Philly would've fucked with it\nCalifornia state property you niggas stuck with it\nBrrrring, sold Peedi Crakk\nGame was on the block in his beanie with a Mac\nI'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of\nA Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada\nLet me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters\nBlac Chyna head the bomb, al-Qaeda\nListen, you want beef I'll cater\nGame snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator\nSilver and black Ghost, nigga that's Al Davis\nGive me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders\nThe Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed\n16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff\nYour man acting girly too put 30 on his chest\nKanye shrug bitch, welcome to the west\nYG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check\nShout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep\nBentley truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up\nDon't get me fucked up, you see the semi tucked, duck\nPass the Goose, where them duck ducks?\nThese hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny fucked up\nI'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus\nTold that bitch to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice\nThe Maybach is A.I\nArtificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau\nAll my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five\nTell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die\nNow do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?\nUsed to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti\nAnd I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy\nBefore that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies\nThat's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one\nAnd you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none\nI'm the old DMX you niggas Drag-On\nGame raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum\nUsed to ether the niggas in all of my 16s\nNow I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween\nThis ain't a dream, nigga hurricane a nightmare\nStab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair\nYour daddy was a bitch, I had to do it\nI ain't need no ski mask to do it\nMurder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it\nName a state, I'll send a package through it\nIf the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts Huh!\nSitting in this Maybach with music\nYour head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it\nPARTY sent my jackas to it\nDrama bring the Mac into it\nAnd this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it\nGold on my neck, I make your bitch put her back into it\nUsain Bolt if you bring a real track into it\nAnother classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it\nDre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it\nTraffic moving backwards through it\nEver since I had the Buick\nKnown for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it\nAnd I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music\nEvery situation in rap, I've been a savage through it\nAnd all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em\nThey can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it\nBe LeBron bitch, I'm Jayceon bitch\nWho else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?\nAnother foreign car driven by a convict\nAventador matte black Akon lips\nNas ether niggas, Game napalm shit\nNiggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch\nNo nigga can see me, on or off TV\nGum bottom Yeezys, I'm the 6' 5\" Eazy\nLightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy\nI'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's\nI'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny\nOr you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny\nI got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi\nBang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly\nShe got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek\nAnd ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak\nSee that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak\nBlood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek\nNicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m\nFour deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets\nIt could happen lowkey\nYou better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet\nThis ain't a diss, nigga\nThis is all lives matter except this nigga's\n\n[Outro: The Game]\nThis 1992 shit ain't no new shit\nWe in that all black you won't know who Blood and who Crip\nWith guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship\nFuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips\nMy nigga Drizzy packed you out and you ain't do shit\nThis the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit\nNigga, you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick\nAnd snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit\nAnd I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick\nSo tell your lil' vivrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip\nWe know where you live, nigga, you better move quick\nAnd start thinking twice about who you hop in the coupe with"

That's how I remember it\nYeah, dip into the liquor store, nine in my khakis\nCrips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne\nMy city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out\nJabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags\nDisintegrate niggas when enemy, dome shots like Kennedy\nSlugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies\nAnd if you don't know where the fuck they got me from\nMartin Scorsese when I pull out my gun\nScarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste\nAsk your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste\nBasket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left\nRun up in Beats, \"Bitch pass the safe! Compton\"\nProduced by a billion in this motherfucker\nStill smokin', Dre we need a ceilin' in this motherfucker\nCompton! They killin' in this motherfucker\nThey grillin' in this motherfucker\nLock the door, they stealin' in this motherfucker\nNo chains, no rings, this my home\nNigga, this Hub City, no-fly zone\nNiggas pull out burners\nStart breakin' like Turbo on Ozone\nCrack fiends on the back streets\nWhere the tracks lean, where the needles lay\nAnd switchblades, if you bitch made\nPut chili all on your Frito Lay's\nWhere we dream of Montego Bay\nBut all we got is the swap meet\nWhere the cops meet, go bang bang\nLeaves blood stains on that concrete\nAnd I'm the only nigga bumpin' Mobb Deep\n'Cause I mob deep down that side street\n'Cause I'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars\nDon't hate me, better get your dollars\nI be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands\nLeanin' on that Brougham\nFlamed up like a Coke can with my name on it\n\n[Outro: Asia Bryant]\nAnother day in Compton, the thrill is high\nKnow somebody's watchin', but I don't know why\nFeel the fire burnin', it touches the sky\nFeel 'em coming at you, I won't die tonight\nSo I get by, I get by\nI get by, I get, I get by\n'Cause it's just another day in Compton"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: The Game]\nSince Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna\nAnd put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama\nThis for all the lost girls locked up in the pen\nAll the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man\nRespect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10\nWe don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end\nAnd we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim\nThere\u2019s missing women out there, let\u2019s just focus on them\nThis song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway\nI feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day\nI know she gone, but she ain't far away\nI just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye\nI'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay\nSit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way\nMy daddy used to beat up on my mama all day\nSo I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway\nI learned this the hard way, when police came our way\nMy daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)\nPlus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you\nNow my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya\nYou want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya\nYou ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture\nYou better thank God you still breathing air\nCause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no (I won't)\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us  (I said I won't)\nPlease don\u2019t use us, dooon\u2019t\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nGood evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian\nWith some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em\nWho's still getting tested?\nWhere's all the women that still remember who they slept with?\nWhere's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list\nBut when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?\nDo it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah\nI love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa\nI love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza\nIronically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl\nThis song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love\nUntil she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly\nShe a little too carefree in 10 years\nWho's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me, yeah\nI'm probably not the man you take me for\nBut I bet I could be if you make me yours\nMost of the shit I say is true\nWhen I\u2019m done with bad bitches, know I\u2019m coming straight to you good girl\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us\nPlease don\u2019t use us, noo\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nDrizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives\nLike, \"uhh, them is basketball wives?\"\nOnly cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick\nCan't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict\nNever sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with\nAnd never buy a chick a bag on the first date\nI pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass \"get on!\"\nDisrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on\nI don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls\nLike \"hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world\"\nGet busy girl, drink that ros\u00e9 'til you're dizzy girl\nShe walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?\nHe on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce\nRight under Kanye, so let the Don spray\nThat\u2019s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry\nSoon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like \"let's ride\"\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon\u2019t make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us\nPlease don\u2019t use us, nooo\n\n[Verse 4: The Game]\nWord on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man\nAnd thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy\nSurrounded by them diamonds, I'mma cold mackin\nNigga its a cold climate, don\u2019t ask me where the crime went\nJust tell me where them dimes went\nSo I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas\nYeah I\u2019m married to the game\nAnd she married to my chain, watching Boyz n The Hood\nLets take a drive down memory lane"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: children talking about 50's music]\n[Kid #1]\nMy mom took me to Sam Goody\nI wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD\nI took that shit home\nThat shit was wack like a motherfucker\nI fuck with Game\n\n[Kid #2]\nI like 50 Cent\nHe reminds me SpongeBob\nAnd Tony Yayo is Blue's Clues\nAnd Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer\nThey're my friends\nPsyche\n\n[Kid #3]\nI went down one of them bodega shits right there in Harlem\nGot me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD\nTook that shit home, put it in my boombox\nThought I was 'bout to be on some Radio Raheem shit\nMan that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams in '88\nI mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man\nSo this Black Wall Street for life now\nG-G-G-Unot!\n\n[The Game]\n300 Bars and Runnin'\nJust loan me your ears for fifteen minutes\nWalk with me\nHere the breakdown\nPass the doja, .45 in the holster\nHollow tips'll fold 'em, them niggas, they toy soldiers\nOh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober\nLike I'm the president, but this ain't the Takeover\nNow, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer\nBefore you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed\nWhy would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat\nThat was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back\nDefending his yard, yeah, standing his ground\nI'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown\nNah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison Square\nWatch everybody sleep through it\nWe can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em\nWhat they say? Bleek is over, let Chris and Neef do it\nThey say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly\nWhat you thought? Them was the only niggas rapped in Philly?\nSee them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly\nThen dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly\nCosmic Kev called, said Curtis Jack in Philly\nMake a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly\nI forgot my cheesesteak, that's what I told the cops\nSo they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the Glock\nAnd I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops\nEven I was ready to die, when I heard that he was shot\nWhat's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot\nLabels signing anything, still searching for they Pac\nI put purple on the block, so I don't feel threatened\nWhen Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot\nAsk 50, it get lonely on top, you can hate me\nOr love me, but now the cops the only homies he got\nWhen it's beef we eat, when we hear bologna, we pop\nYou sell records but a G-G-G-U-not\nActing big on the radio, to me you not\nYou can ask Mister Cee who hot\nTony Yayo, I bet 10 G's you flop\nRun up on that new 300C you got\nStop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop\nAnd I hope you blackout before you see the cops\nI ain't High Top from Colors, I'm from Cedar Block\nBut what I got in my high tops'll make your breathing stop\nI'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop\nI'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe he dropped\nNow I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot\nI picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped\nI saw the west coast, put the shit on my back\nSprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the straps\nIt get hot in here, let Lucifer rap\nBring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track\nTake it to the streets, put the duece-duece to your hat\nThen call the pigs, tell them the rooster is back\nCall Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back\nI'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped\nFuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who could rap\nIt's about when the Ruger clap, is rufus back?\nI see what you thinkin', you want me to die, is that so?\nNow you left leaning back thanks to Fat Joe\nWe got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go\nDrop them off, then pop Cristal with Esco\nI'ma say he hit me first if me and Dre talk\nAll Nas said back was he had a braveheart\nNow that's the eulogy, beefing is kinda foolish\nSee niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me\nBut quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping\nAnd you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured\nEven behind bars, I'm still gon' shine\nI'm ten years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine\nThen I go right back, nigga, I pop minds\nHow you gon' drop Olivia? You only drop dimes\nI knew you changed when you started sleeping in that vest, dawg\nI don't need 50 Cent, my niggas make collect calls\n1-800-split a faggot nigga wig\nHe got G-Unit wings, throw 'em off the Queens Bridge\nNow your career is over-career is over\nWe in Q.B., banging C.N.N. in the rover\nT-O-N-Y, that's Capone n' NORE\nYou ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring\nTake that shit off nigga, go back to PC\nAnd tell 50 Cent to send you a copy of Beef 3\nI'm airing their ass out on D-V-D\nYou wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks, repeat after me\n\"I'm a G-Unit toy soldier on Sesame Street\nDoing voice overs,\" bitch ass nigga\nNeed a rhyme dictionary to rehearse his lines\nSound like Oscar the Grouch with them nursery rhymes\nWe was in the studio when I first got signed\nHe got stuck, he called 50, tried to borrow some lines\nThat's the wrong nigga, when you need help with your rhyme\nAll he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time\nGot mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine\nYou got lucky with Ja, why you ain't go at Shyne?\nHe freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact\nSaid he'd put you with your mom and you ain't fucked with that\nThen you lied about your pops, he never bust no cap\nLike father, like son, go ask Busta that\nI knew from the beginning not to trust those cats\nI'd kill 'em all if I could bring Justo back\nThe underground is mine, I treat it like home\nIt's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones\nThe underground is mine, I treat it like home\nIt's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones\nThe underground is mine, I treat it like home\nIt's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones\nI said\nThe underground is mine, I treat it like home\nIt's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones\nAnd I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it\nDo whatever to it, put it in the store, the shit moving\nGave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it\nCame with two hundred, nigga this is more than music\nEven Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer\nBoth feet in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin'\nI beef with any nigga, say my name, motherfucka, I'm gunnin'\nYou can put it on Skee if you want it\nI'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue\nAnd watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordan shoe\nI told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid\nWe gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs\nDon't hit me on the Sidekick asking what you did\nGet a gun or ask 50's police to use his\n'Cause Bloods gonna get ya\nBlood-Blood-Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain\nThat 380 spill brains, when I pop shots\nOutside N.Y., in front of hip-hop cops\nOr broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre\nThis nigga bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say\nTook me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes\nSo I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face\nDrop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes\n'Cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake\nFor caking off niggas on them CD's and tapes\nAsk him to scratch a record, you will see that he is fake\nIf 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheesecake\nTake the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant Replay\nNow the instant replay, I mean the machine\nThat G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like\n\"Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit\nNiggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit\"\nOn my album, 50 helped me just a lil' bit\nOnly on two songs, now back to some killer shit\nMy clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick\nBeating on your chest, I see to your death, yep\nTell Ecko to make him a suit\nTell Reebok to make him some boots, get him a head band\nTo cover the holes in his head, he a dead man\nFor thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman\nBanks blacked out and let the gun blam\nWithout a M-E-T-H-O-D Man\nSo the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings\nTake my advice, never wear Air Max to the bing\nUnless you one of the Bloods or a Latin King\n'Cause if you left with the Aryans your ass'll sting\nAnd your cellmate is a 25 to lifer\nThey'll stab you in Folsom, then fuck you on Rikers\nAnd life goes on\nNow back to the coward of the hour, who lied and said he write my songs\nHe told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf\nSo he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself\nNigga stop acting tough before I stand over you\nShow you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre\nMake a move, I'm blasting, add those to the last ones\nTen shots from the MAC, empty the rest in the passenger\nFase yelling that's enough, let the coroner bag him up\nThrow in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum\nGun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up\nReverse the '05 hearse on 41st and traffic, what\nHip-hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up\nThe Dodge got a Hemi in it, Game got Remy in 'em\nIn and out of lanes like a New York cab\nI miss the old king that New York had\nWho's this fake nigga on pictures with the Jake nigga?\nGot his crew starving 'cause he ate the whole cake, nigga\nHe ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga\nIf he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?\nWe getting tired of you talkin about who you shot\nI'll use another six bars to tell you who you not\nYou ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta\nYou went out with Vivica, three months after Wanksta\nGet Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot\nNow the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop\nC'mon man, what happened to the thug?\nNow you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging\nNigga got mad when The Game start buzzing\nSo fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs\nOlivia talking about we a family, Game had to go\nNigga, I'll smack that hoe like I'm Jackie-O\n'Cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you\nI don't wanna shake hands or wear your G-Unit shoes\nDon't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group\nJust wanna sit here and wait (for the summer)\nTo be gone, so I can head back to the block\nFresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted\nPull the brim low, if they don't get it\nBentley Coup on gold Daytons, I was the first one with it\nFour times platinum, I done been there and did it\nCame in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it\nThey say the Lord giveth, Lord take it away\nSo I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day\nNiggas hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play\nAnd the D.A. waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake\nSo they can put me in the squad car and lock me away\nGive me a odd job in the pen for minimal pay\nLet me out so I can drive down criminal way\nPushing the rock, nah, this ain't no subliminal, Jay\nThe summer too hot and I just want the winter to stay\n'Cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page\nSimilar to them shells going into my gauge\nI hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into grenades\nAnd Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game\nLike I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain\nNow back to reality, my gun and my vest\nAnd if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West\nTake a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet Jacob\nWhole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em\nAnd the flow is hot like thou with Satan\nAnd the only thing I got spinning is Daytons\nThe hotter I get, the more willing to snake 'em\nSo soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em\nCompton swap meet to get me some All-Stars\nWhen Game in the house, they callin' all cars\n'Cause they heard about what went on in D.C\nHeard about Hot 97, my beef with 50\nNow tell me do he got a conscience?\nI think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in his nonsense\nWouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference\nI'd rather be pushing rock like Samantha Ronson\n50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding\nWe ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson\nMiddle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson\nHip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict\nWhat happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming\nDoug E. Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common\nNow that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen\nThe flow is noodles, I throw it up like vomit\nAnd I still shine like diamonds, they kicked me out of\nG-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman\nIt's still Aftermath, two feet in the paint\nShould I be mad? I ain't\nI'm supposed to stop, I can't\nBecause I'm in the hood politicking, Impala liftin'\nAnd I keep a black four-five on the side of my Prada denim\nChip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison\nDollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing\nThen re-up like Kim before the d-cup\nContinuously getting money with my feet up\nChasing the throne, here my black Air Force\nI said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source\nFeel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me\nBut you ain't gon' do that, so, motherfucker, move back\nWhile I do B.I.G. and Pac impersonations on two tracks\nWhen I wake the dead, everybody remove hats\nWe miss y'all, can I get a hand clap?\nNow back to rap and why I gotta stay strapped?\nOn that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP\nThey don't know which hole to patch up when the K clap\nI tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback\nIt go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash, nigga?\nSay my name, now that's your fucking ass, nigga\nKept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass, nigga\nNow I gotta lay you down like the last nigga\nBuck, buck, buck from my AK-47\nThis nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in Heaven\nTryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo\nPrepare for burials when I'm reincarnating Harry-O\nAnd you don't want that David 'cause you love your life\nGet my Vibe? When it's war, he pull out butter knifes\nMuthafucker, I'ma show you who the gangsta\nAll you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?\nWhen Suge had you, you were stranded on the row\nJuve left you for dead and went back to the N.O\n50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow\nThen he made you temporary replacement for Yayo\nYou a bitch and that's hard to swallow\nAnd you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago\nI call my nigga Jojo to get it back\nHe had the shit in his hands and you ain't had the ten stacks\nPicture that, I thought we was G-Unit\nThen you ran and told 50 that I did the shit\nAsk C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find\nI told Monica when I catch him, the boy is mine\nTake one shot of Brandy and pop\nWatch his panties drop when I run inside the Candy Shop\nFuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops\nAnd Olivia, I mean for a man, she hot\nNow I'm running out of breath, like I just beatboxed\nGot twenty bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock\nDon't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot\nHurricanes in store November, nigga, fuck Reeboks\nI'm fly like a hummingbird on a tree top\nThe new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new Pac, I need three spots\n280 in, ain't no getting me back\nI'm yelling, \"Fuck the world,\" on my victory lap\nRemember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek\nNow it's whoever, motherfucker, yeah, who want beef?\nNow whenever, motherfucker, who wanna see me?\nIn the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace\nYou don't want war, nigga, you want peace\nSo give 'em the piece, capisce, let 'em rest in peace\nFrom West to East, the flow is outdatable, irreplaceable\nLyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan\nAnd I slipped 'em the ace, so you cannot replace 'em\nIf Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon\nA king in the making and the throne is for the taking\nSo I climb the mountain top and put my stake in\nGot the weight of the world on my shoulder\nNot a nigga, nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over\nThis is crack music, go get the baking soda\n300 Bars and Runnin', nigga, the wait is over\nI'm gone"

Yeah, mothafuckas!\nCompton's back on the mothafuckin' map\nAftermath in that ass, bitch\nGame, let's go\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nMe and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit\nThey talk shit about us but that shit is foul when\nI'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums\nMake my mother proud that her son made it out\nBut it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist\nThey say shit but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest\nLike Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty\nAnd decided to chase it, me, him and 50 racin'\nThis rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit\nThink of what I wanna say, step in the booth and one-take it\nHow could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits\nThen spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit\nThe media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch\nThey accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places\nAt first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts\nNow people wanna place him with murderers and rapists\nThey comin', I can taste this, swear to God I ain't racin'\nPut the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit\nI'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit\nSo I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this\nSo they callin' us\n\n[Hook: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nWe ain't goin'\nNowhere, so fuck you\nWe ain't goin'\nNowhere, so fuck you\nThis day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')\nThings just ain't the same for gangstas\nThe game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')\nIt's a new game!

Coles, and Big Seans\nTime for the world to pay homage\nBow to the rap Gods or them K's vomit\nFuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit\nIf you ain't fuck, then you ain't get your dick wet\nI see your little chain\nI see your little dreads, tryin' to be a Lil Wayne, shit\nI used to wanna be a little Hov\nStarted with a little rock, got me a little stove\nMade a little money, bought me a little Rov'\nPaid cash money like I was from Hollygrove\nSold ten mill, everybody know my name now\nThinkin' back, it's a motherfuckin' shame how\nBiggie got killed and Pac got murked\nSometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nAs the blood spills from my pen\nIt's time to confess my sins, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nI smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill\nCause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nI'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight\nBut I ain't tryin' to go to hell\n\n[Chorus: K.

Dot, watch us do a 360\nPlus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries\nI ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries\nFinally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me\nFunny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me\nFuck 'em all\n\n[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]\nFather forgive me, cause I ain't perfect\nNo, no no no\nWhy is everything wrong?\nOh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right\n\n\n[Break: K. Roosevelt]\nSee I been spendin' these late nights\nOn girls I never see again\nConstantly intoxicated\nOnly God could save me, yeah\nWith 'em by the sunrise\nOne day everyone dies\nThat's the way the story goes\nBut now, I can't feel my heart\nBut I just keep ridin', ridin'\nFeel so numb, numb, oh yeah\n\n[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]\nFather forgive me, cause I ain't perfect\nNo, no no no\nWhy is everything wrong?\nOh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right"

I got a son...\nB: What the fuck you talkin' about nigga?\nCome on nigga, lets take yo' ass to the crib man, you tired nigga\nAnd put the drink down nigga. We gotta go nigga\nG: One more shot\n\n[Chorus: Shorty of Da Lench Mob]\nI didn't mean to walk away\nBut I hear every word they say\nI guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la\nNow I'm sittin' in this god damned cage\nRreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate\nAs the devil sings la-la-la\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nDre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you\nBut I'm a man, and sometimes a man, do what he gotta do\nRemember, I'm from Compton too\nI saw you and Eazy in 'em, so I started wearin' Khaki suits\nI was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92\nI had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you\nI made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru\nWhatever I was, I was bangin' Gin & Juice\nNever knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop\nNow I gotta keep it gangsta, 'cause its in my roots\nSo I owe you my life, when I betrayed you\nI tried to think of what the fuck, Eminem might do\nIf every nigga hated him, for the Black Bitch track\nAnd niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after Dee Barnes got slapped\nWhen Doc say its a wrap, its a wrap\nIts still Aftermath, and ain't nothing after that\n\n[Chorus: Shorty of Da Lench Mob]\nI didn't mean to walk away\nBut I hear every word they say\nI guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la\nNow I'm sittin' in this god damned cage\nRreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate\nAs the devil sings la-la-la\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nI never said Thank You, and I took for granted\nYou let me in your house, and made me a part of your family\nNow I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes\nI wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed\nAnd even though sometimes I run loose\nYou still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you\nI'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef\nBut you told me it was okay to say Fuck The Police\nNow its my turn to carry the torch\nAnd I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source\nRemember when we got drunk, to do Start From Scratch?\nI told you, you was like a father to me I meant that\nSittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques\nThinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track\nWhen Doc say its a wrap, its a wrap\nIts still Aftermath, and ain't nothin' after that\n\n[Chorus: Shorty of Da Lench Mob]\nI didn't mean to walk away\nBut I hear every word they say\nI guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la\nNow I'm sittin' in this god damned cage\nRreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate\nAs the devil sings la-la-la\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nSee when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger\nThe fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga\nMost of the time I let 'em know, I don't agree with what he do\nBut he a hardhead Dre, that's why I'm talkin' to you\nSee, when I first met my nigga, son was layin' in the cut\nType reserved, homie was quite and kept his mouth shut\nUntil you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut\nI dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck\nAs time went on, now he was workin' with the finest\nI saw the pressure started to build, so I gave additional guidance\nYou gave him something that can make or break a nigga, you should face it\nSo big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it\nWith the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction\nThe only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen\nBut when Doc say its a wrap, it's a wrap\nIts still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that\n\n[Chorus: Shorty of Da Lench Mob]\nI didn't mean to walk away\nBut I hear every word they say\nI guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la\nNow I'm sittin' in this god damned cage\nRreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate\nAs the devil sings la-la-la\n\n[Outro: Game & Busta Rhymes]\nB: Aiyo, Game!

bruise limbs\nStomp a nigga face in, in some huge Timbs\nNiggas don't invite me to shit, I had to move in\nAnnihilated Bleek, had to tie a couple loose ends\nCouple crashed cars, had to lose a few friends\nWifey want an Escalade, I just copped a new Benz\nFuck stock, hood niggas ride new rims\nDubs too small fuck it go on 22 then\n22 shrinking now we on 24's\nWon't be long til 6's sittin' on

strike match\nEmpire Strikes Back, Jedi Mind Tricks\nThis is how the stars war, why you acting hard for?\nMe, I'm hardcore, middle of Darfur\nYou don't wanna see what the fuck is inside the car door\nI got something big under the T-shirt\nOn the front it say \"Tha Carter IV\"\nI'm about to order more\nNigga they ain't told you?\nIt's like the Gulf War\nPut a hole in one of you niggas, no par 4\n'Rari on the green, got a V12 Ferrari on the green\nI be twisting Bob Marley on the green\nI took 100 thou just to add another Mazerati to the team\nShould of saw me as a teen, facin' the magazine\nAny drama, I'm loading up a case of the magazines\nNot the Source or the XXL know what I mean?\nRolling Stone, ain't getting my Vibe\nSo I remain King\nAt least til T.I. home\nAs far as the East, ain't no King nigga B.I. gone\nFar as bars that four ocho cinco\nSo the next line is for Ocho Cinco\nEasy on the Clicqot, homie don't drink so\nI'ma guzzle the bottle and find me a fucking sink yo\nWhere Otis? Somewhere playing Bingo\nStar on my face, I'm a star like Ringo\nTen bars left, su woo is the lingo\nAll red everything, no visine though\nJust left Boston, no Benzino\nHit something out in New York, Bambino\nAnd I coach my team like Pitino\nHe know, we hit King of Diamonds\nEverybody throwing c-notes\nOn my way to Sin City, pit stopped in Reno\nFeeling like Carlito before they casted Pacino\nMatter fact fuck him, De Niro in Casino\n500th bar, Fuck You; CeeLo"

Are we gonna die?\nWe are dying\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nLight a blunt, throw on Nas, collect my thoughts\nBlow the candles out as I contemplate in the dark\nDumpin' ashes on the fuckin' Time magazine\nTryna burn a hole between Israel and Palestine\nAll this world news, all these dead bodies\nAll these kids dying, the talk of illuminati\nAs I'm murderin' ink, I get a call from Irv Gotti\nSay \"Keep spittin' cause when you do it's like a 12-gauge shotty\"\nGot machetes and them cannons loaded up\nGot them Xany's and that lean in my cup\nThese politician's can come up missin', I'm on a mission\nYou hear them gun shots, now mother fuckers listenin'\nFeel that you can take their life cause they ain't got a pot to piss in\nRaise the Christian, kill you for these kids as victims\nFuck the system\nYou give a kid 30 cent and think you sponsor somethin'?\nI feed a village by myself nigga Compton comin'\nPurge\n\n[Hook: Stacy Barthe (Game)]\nWe are dying, we are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying, some times I gotta purge\n(Sometimes I wanna)\nWe're living on a purge\n(Sometimes I wanna)\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nWhat if we ran through Beverley Hills, got 70 kills\nRidin' down Rodeo in the Chevy with pills\nAnd pop one, load 12 slugs in the eagle\nAnd shot one, Donald Sterling hopped in his Benz\nI got one, beam on the back of his dome\nPalm sweaty on the back of the chrome\nThat's my adrenaline\nSo we purge Sandusky, purge Zimmerman\nPurge every mother fucker rapin' women in\nPurge niggas killin' kids, back to back in two vans\nMe and my mercenaries, middle of South Sudan\nCarryin' babies bodies, long as I got two hands\nLong as I got two feet, millions and my crew deep\nWe purge for the families, they deaths ain't in vein now\nCrash my ass, niggas know who shot that plane down\nTwo hundred and ninety eight innocent lives severed\nFlyin' on Aaliyah's wings all the way to heaven\nAnd so we Purge\n\n[Hook]\nWe are dying, we are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying, some times\n(Sometimes I wanna)\nWe are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nImagine going to the stores without cops harrasing\nImagine Mike Brown walkin', them same cops just passed 'em\nI'm smokin' hash, and let me ash it before I talk in past tense\nI hope his mama tears is like acid to your fuckin badges\n2 shots in his brain, 4 in his fashion\nThinkin' 'bout his casket in this Phantom, swear I almost crashed it\nThat's why I'm headed to Ferguson with this German ruger\nCause I'm probably more like Nelson Mandela than Martin Luther\nMore like Ice T than Ice Cube, I'm a cop killer\nMurder all the cops, then the cops will probably stop killin'\nOn my knees prayin', wish my nigga Pac was livin'\nBut he fell victim to the Rampart Division, purge\nCops killed Biggie, cops beat up Rodney King\nWe tore up the city nigga, purge\nOr just stand there like J. Cole\nAnd shoot at cops in the same spot till the case closed, purge\n\n[Hook]\nWe are dying, we are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying, some times\n(Sometimes I wanna)\nWe are dying\n(purge)\n\n[Outro: Game]\nThis song is dedicated\nTo my engineer Jus' wife\nCarey Jean who passed away June 28th at 1.45 pm\nTo stomach cancer\n2 days before my son Harlem's 11th birthday\nCrazy how he mournin' his wife's death and I'm celebrating my son's life\nI'll never understand death, shit\nSometimes it's a struggle to understand life, shit crazy\nI'll never understand\nCan't stop fightin' to survive though, but what we fightin' for when we eventually all die though, purge\nEventually we all victims of the purge\nUs killers, what's keepin' us alive\nIt's a question nobody got the answer to\nSo PURGE!"

Somebody, help me!\nRicky, Ricky!\nRicky!\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nBlood of a slave, heart of a giant\nHad to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant\nThat was five years ago, look how fast it go\nDestroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico\nBut fuck that, blaze one, where the matches, yo?\nHit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go\nRoll the window down, clip off the ashes so\nYou can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow\nHow many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive\nHow many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside\nNiggas try to shut me up like Malcom\nBut standin' in the window K smokin' was the outcome\nSometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium\nHit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion\nSo niggas think twice 'bout my medallion or\nYou'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling \"Ricky!\"\nMy nostalgia is a hunnid percent Compton, zero percent snitch\nPark a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks where I used to pitch\nMade the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did\nAnd just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig\nTwo to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib\nThen I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear\n\n[Interlude: Boyz n the Hood (1991)]\nCome on, let's get 'em, let's get em\nGet 'em, man, get 'em\nCut him off, pull right here, cut him off\nGo, man, go\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nFeelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor\nAll I could think about was if the cops took my weed and my choppers\nThey want me to sing like Sinatra,\nI told the detective get this clear like Belvedere vodka\nThem five that shots then created a monster\nHell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton\nI seen Boyz n the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor\n2Pac was the real life \"Ricky!\"\nThen they shot down the nigga that shot him, swear to God\nIf I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim\nI'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims\nAnd punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim\nNobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options\nWanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in\nThen my grandmother house went up for auction\nAnd that's what what killed her, I'm goin' back to buy the block then\nToo many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran\nAnd defend all my niggas ith they face under stockings\nRather face God than 25 with no options\nIf Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten\nDrive by with our face painted, like a clown\nWith a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground\nThis how my livin' room sound, when my brother got shot down\n\n(Crying (sample from Boyz n the Hood))"

So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back. You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between. But I done learned 'cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit. What I learned over the years though is, man, sometimes you ain't gotta be the judge, the jury or the situation 'cause karma gonna handle it\u2019s business 'cause it\u2019s [fair]\"\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nLate night down Sunset, liking the scene\nOn a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win\nDon't know how it begin, every day was a new\nWhen he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth\nAnd if crack had took a part of the homies family tree\nThe lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me\nAnd him to know my life story and we not even meet\nWhen we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing\nWhen the last time I seen him? He was playing his tape\nThat he would later title Makaveli the Great\nSmile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas\nTry to touch money, high on weed and liquor\nHoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix\nDead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him\nWhatever shit you dealing with, you get you two Glocks\nI guarantee that pussy shit'll stop\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\n\n[Hook: Game]\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\n\n[Outro: Game]\nLast time I seen him was in the mirror this morning\nRiverside, motherfucker"

Right there!\nI had all you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs\nI'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear\nThe last twelve months been a fucking nightmare\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nThis shit worse than arguing with my bitch\nI done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch\nGet yo hand out my pocket nigga, go fish\nI was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit\nNigga you tell me, what you want me to do\nDrop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?\nOh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you\nI put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru\nAnd the reality is, I could die too\nAnd end up in the cemetery, right beside you, we can both rot\nAngels flying over my headstone, but the devils inside yo' box\nYou wanted my shine so I gave you ice\nThen I gave you a second chance and you played me twice\nCouldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life\nI shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Andrea Martin]\nBlack Wall Street fo' life\nOnly fuck with you on two occasions\nWhen I'm out of my mind, or when I'm high\nI only, fuck with you..."

Them is nobody\nThey should have torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies\nI mean look at these pictures, shit is so sloppy\nCouldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti\nFeed a nigga to the sharks after dark\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, fuck this shit, I thought I told y'all\nIt was money on the table by the bricks\nI was at the kitchen table choppin' up some shit\nListenin' to Jeezy and I heard a little (*bullet sound*)\nSo I turned the radio down and cocked my four-fif'\nOh shit... Am I hit? Nah, just a hole in my Jordan fit\nSo I turn down all the lights and cocked my four-fifth\nSeen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it\nHow much longer I gotta stay in this mothafucka?\nLet me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke\nBut shit, y'all got a nigga stressed\nI gotta stay in this mothafucka 'til I confess?\nShit, y'all bitches better get some rest\n'Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami\n'Fore I snitch on myself or the 'hood, you understand me?\nYeah, I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy\nNiggas runnin' 'round the 'hood singin' they should get a Grammy\nAnd you two motherfuckas should get an Oscar\nWith this good-cop-bad-cop shit, take me to process\n'Cause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs\nI watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years\nNo evidence, no bid, I don't know who split them niggas' wigs\n\n[Verse: 3]\nAlready told y'all, it was money on the table with the bricks\nI was walkin' to the bathroom to take a shit\nThen I heard my dogs barkin', and some noise by the fence\nSo I ran to my room and reached for the four-fifth\nThen I seen three niggas by my back door\nLooked out the bathroom window and seen two more\nSo I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer\nGuess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store"

Hooves\nRidin' down 74th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy\nCadillac and a coupe\nSee them niggas hatin' from afar, can\u2019t catch 'em now\nBut they getting smacked when we do\nRat-a-tat like we Snoop, Crown on the Vic\nCrown on my wrist, crown on my bitch\nAnd a couple crowns on my crew\nCouple pounds of the blue, ivy in it\nTsunami in it when I be in it\nGot the lobby in it, Tommy in it\nThe trunk got a body in it\nNiggas be like, \"He bodying it\"\nZiploc full of J\u2019s, closet full of J\u2019s\nWorkin' on my Pippen, he\u2019s Scotty in it\nBath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it\n8 gold chains like a Saudi in it\nMurder with the ink, I\u2019m Gotti in it\nDon\u2019t get too pop, get your ass 2Pac'd\nCargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it\nPlus I still got a crib on Brazil\nI ain\u2019t never hardly there but I got a Maserati in it\nThat\u2019s my new addition, no Bobby in it\nChop shops in the hood, no karate in it\nSo much money, got a money tree\nWhoop so many niggas\u2019 ass, shit we Money Team\nSame fuck niggas with they hand out, same sad song\nBring the bands out, nigga should be workin on they money scheme\nBack to the convers', kill 'em with one verse\nConverse with the worst 'til one of our gun burst\nCall the mortuary, tell him niggas in one hearse\nCause Compton ain\u2019t like the city of Commerce\nNo back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt\nNiggas got them choppas like we flyin' a black hawk\nPut you with the roots, thinkin' a nigga was Black Thought\nNow hold that thought\nMotherfuckers wanna act loco\nHit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4\nMotherfuckers wanna act loco\nHit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4\n\n[Hook]\nToo high, can\u2019t come down\nLosing my head, spinning round and round\nToo high, can\u2019t come down\nLosing my head, spinning round and round\n\n[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]\nPray for me, I\u2019ll make 30\nDesert Eagle, my nails dirty\nEverything on life and I\u2019d die for it\nMade a mil', you ain\u2019t even know it\nTell Illuminati I\u2019m down for it\nCall Jigga, I'm next nigga\nSon niggas my new litter\nFuck the world on Earth Day\nHer booty clap on my birthday\nI would take the cake but I\u2019ve been paid\nI\u2019m a real nigga, you\u2019s arcade\nHad a switchblade in the 5th grade\nSmoked plenty weed on my mama\u2019s couch\nNow I\u2019m going big, I can buy the house\nYou sound water down, I sound off a ounce\nSee this for those who say \"Where you from?\"\nAnd for those hoes who go' make me cum\nBut them fuck niggas we don\u2019t fuck with them\nAnd fuck niggas gon' lose a lung\nKnock knock nigga, come feel the drum\nIf the bread low, I'ma stack the crumb\nHide the contraband in-between my gum\nBefore smoking dope, I was selling coke\nWell rocked up to a 8 year old\nWhen it popped up, call it pot luck\n500 G\u2019s, nigga pretty please\nCondos where it\u2019s sun and trees\n10 tees with my 80s\nHoover hats like the Star of David\nPull on, shots a must, get me faded\nRan up on 'em, I ain't good with aimin'\nMove out the set but the set I\u2019m banging\n\n[Hook]\nToo high, can\u2019t come down\nLosing my head, spinning round and round\nToo high,

Benz\nDoing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket\nSox Gang off in the streets\n10 hut, bring the squadron with me\nSee niggas talk ballin like they been in the gym\nBut you lookin like a novice to me now quit talkin to me\nCan I vent?\nAll you niggas sound retarded to me\nKillin these niggas, I\u2019m a general nigga\nTurn yo head to a target for free\nNow I\u2019m on, look at

all Bs\nAnd niggas wanna act like they thuggin like us\nWe said, \"Boy, please\"\nThis S to the K to the E to the Mmm nigga\nNew Rolls go vroom nigga\n.4-5 cocked back like boom nigga\nGot enough loot to fill up a room nigga\nAnd I\u2019m rolling these blunts at 100 a go\nGave her that dick now she beggin' for more\nMade me a milli, yo bitch load is illie\nBut I ain\u2019t got, still got 100 to

Yeah\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nWhat's happenin'? My nigga just died from AIDS\nWhat's happenin'? ISIS throwin' grenades\nWhat's happenin'? White boys shootin' up a church\nWhat's happenin'? My nigga 2-2 just got some work\nWhat's happenin'? You can get it if you got it, nigga\nBut I ain't got it, nigga, I'm just a solid nigga\nWho run Compton, fuck bitches and flick Impala switches\nEven if I was born blind, you niggas couldn't stop my vision\nRight on time with mine thanks to them old Doc prescriptions\nWest side flourishin' again, this what 2Pac envisioned\nObama freeing lifers, that was locked in prison\nEl Chapo said he ran the world, and they forgot to listen\nNot me, nigga, one split second, I say \"Fuck rap\"\nAnd if I ran into El Chapo, he had work as one his captains\nAnd gave me 100 bricks and said \"'Migo, get it bracking\"\nI walk into a Mexican Mafia meeting like\n\n[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]\nWhat's happenin'? Pac's gone, Brenda's still got a baby\nWhat's happenin'? Lost ones in the land of the crazy\nWhat's happenin'? You can have a bad bitch in a Mercedes\nBut that don't make your basic ass Beyonc\u00e9 or Jay-Z\nWhat's happenin'? Obama 'bout to move out the White House\nWhat's happenin'? Couple 'hood niggas 'bout to roll them dice out\nWhat's happenin'? Is you gon' let me use your EBT card? (yeah)\nI wonder if I could slide it for commissary, yah\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nAin't it a shame?\nAnother lost one runnin' again\n(You know I bust my thang for you)\nYou do the same old thing that your brothers did before you\nPlannin' your whole life under concrete in the soil\nJust a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from\nIf I know anythin' it's that my old head taught me all alone\nAnd it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man\nIt's a chess game full of kings and pawns\nBlack and white squares, just depends what side you on\n(What side is you on? What you want?\nWhat you want? What you want?)\nI want a red '64 Impala with them things on it\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nIt's a black out inside an abandoned crack house\nOnly thing from last night was dead bodies and glass pipes\nThat was the age 4, and by the age 10\nThey opened up the caged doors and let the fuckin' beasts out\nFuck my auntie couch, I'm 'bout to take the street route\nAnd get my shit the gangsta way, cause I can't be no Steve Stoute\nI'm too Nas for these niggas, I got a surprise for these niggas\nPotato cookin' on the barrel, I bring the fries to these niggas\nFuneral hall, casket fit to the size of you niggas\nChrome 45, no lie, come say goodbye to you niggas\nSway got all the answers, Kanye lied to you niggas\nI don't even wanna be in no top 5 with you niggas\nI break ties with you niggas, then pay tithes for you niggas\nLos Angeles king, I will no fly zone you niggas\nTake a caravan and Impalas and drive to you niggas\nClose one and aim, Fetty Wap's eye to you niggas\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nAin't it a shame?\nAnother lost one runnin' again\n(You know I bust my thang for you)\nYou do the same old thing that your brothers did before you\nPlannin' your whole life under concrete in the soil\nJust a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from\nIf I know anythin' it's that my old head taught me all alone\nAnd it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man\nIt's a chess game full of kings and pawns\nAll I ever wanted was to ride my '64 down 'Shaw\nUh, I'ma spit them verses for my niggas\nDreams comin' true, don't it always paint a perfect picture"

Dodger, now I'm a (angel)\nFrom the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold\nBetween the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome\nYour hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home\nAnd when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam\nCause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones\nThe ones they put wires on, they got us on tap\nBut I put wires on, my Bentley in fact\nI spit it through the wires on a Kanye track\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (angel)\n\n[Outro: Common]\nYeah, it's The Game and Common\nSpread your wings, follow your dreams\nThings will be so serene\nL.A. and the Chi is a team\nYeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on\nYeah, it's for the world boy\nWe do it forever, yeah"

   "lyrics": "[Produced by Hi-Tek]\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nSecond floor of my hotel, I'm rollin' up, 'bout to blaze\nAnd zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze\nAs I daze about the past, and them days in the past\nHe set my mind free, so my mind free at last\nSo much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass\nI'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast\nDidn't understand the dream of a King, I do the math\nCoincidentally on your birthdays, I ditched the class\nCause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash\nChasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass\nRidin' home from school, in front of the bus\nNot even thinkin' 'bout how Rosa Parks done it for us\nHow she stayed behind bars and she done it for us\nAnd she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us\nSometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break\nThat's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face\n(Ohhhh)\nCause sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break\nThat's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nUhh, word up, Game\nStandin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'\nI've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'\nTo the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'\nSome of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them\nThem sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks\nShould never be allowed at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta\nSo people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar\nBut I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude\nMartin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him\nNobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'\nAs a kid I ain't relate really\nI would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your words awoke in me\nFirst I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed\nI was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad\nI ain't even know the strength you had to have to march\nYou was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart\nWe miss you\nFeel like King be in me sometimes\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nThe word \"nigga\" is nothin' like \"nigga\"\nDon't sound shit alike, like Game, like Jigga\nOne came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga\nOne is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture\nThe rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it\nPour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches\nMake 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen\nSame cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'\nIf Dr. King marched today, would Bill Gates march?\nI know Obama would but would Hilary take part?\nGreat minds think great thoughts\nThe pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art\nI feel the pain of Nelson Mandela\nCause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's umbrella\nFor Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call\nThat the future just took a fuckin' head shot\nI wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped\nWould he give me the answer? Probably not\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all"

me\nGangbang classy\nGold herringbone, mama said I'm too flashy\nNiggas wanna jack me, tell 'em, \"Run it,\" like a track meet\nOn my DMX shit, tell my enemies to get at me\nI'm from Compton where the bitches carry ratchets\nAnd niggas in wheelchairs ain't never heard of Degrassi\nRaw hand, I'm gutter, Dre had to Aftermath me\nHad a flow when I was a rider, Compton like Tallahassee\nFirst album classic, second album classic\nSo I skipped the hoodrats and went straight to the Cassies\nN.Y.C., top down, Big blastin'\nNas said I'd be a legend, nigga, don't gas me\nHot in '97, Funk Flex had to ask me\n\"How you make it out that beef with Hov?\"\nNigga, my passion\n\n[Interlude: The Game]\nI was in New York the first time I heard \"Dear Summer\" on Hot 97\nTop of the W Hotel, 54th & Broadway\nLookin' out my window at Diddy in a Sean John sweatsuit\nI felt ambushed by New York niggas\nIt's still West Side though\n\n[Chorus: 21 Savage & The Game]\nLive by the code, die by the code, never been a ho\nBury me before I sell my soul\nLive by the code, die by the code, never been a ho\nBury me before I sell my soul ('Fore I sell my soul)\nAK with the stock (Stock), thirty on the Glock

cruisin' the street in my '64, R.I.P. to Eazy\nI ain't got nothin' against new hip-hop, I fuck with all you niggas\nAnd remember, nigga, I was young too, let's go\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nMade it out the hood and some, I'm on my fourth passport\nGod gave me all this shit, I ain't have to ask for it\nGold Daytons on a '97 Honda Passport\nBlack ski mask on, runnin' from the task force\nUzi, had the cash for it, and I had the stash for it\nFoot on the brake, hit the wipers, open the dashboard\nSold drugs, made straight A's, and I was playin' sports\nYoungin and fresh, six bricks inside a Jansport\nFast forward, countin' this money on Aftermath for it\nBought a new Ferrari, gave my bitch ten stacks\nTold her don't come back here 'til she got an ass for it\nTold her run through mackin' in Louis to get a bag for it\nI give you classics when you ask for it\nI Vince Carter-ed everything Just Blaze threw off the backboard\nFuck a Grammy, that is not what I come back for\nI came for hip-hop, niggas forgot to lock the back door\n\n[Chorus: 21 Savage & The Game]\nLive by the code, die by the code, never been a ho\nBury me before I sell my soul\nLive by the code, die by the code,

'em with the chopper, watch a nigga get seasick (Sea)\nThrowin' up the pyramid, like I'm from Egypt (Gang)\nThe hunnid round see-through, y'all so see-through (Bop)\nI know real Crips and they say they never see you\nJust like Clifford, I'm the big red Blood, ayy\nGlock 45, get a big red slug\nYou ain't Blood, you a bitch, you a big red stud (Oh)\nWay before the rap, I trappin' out the cold\nI didn't know how to water whip, I straight dropped the dope (Oh)\nAll these guns in the car, I gotta wear a seatbelt\nI ain't got no license, so I gotta wear my seatbelt (Skrrt)\nI do this shit myself, nigga, I don't need no help\nWalk up on 'em with that, God help me, he a priest now (Bop)\nAK with the stock (Stock), thirty on the Glock (Glock)\nKill all the opps (Opps), ride on the cops (Cops)\nPosted on the block, deuce-deuce in my sock\nFeel like Mozzy, I got one up top (Yeah)\nCouple years, real niggas gon' be extinct\nBitch, I got a MAC-10 under this mink\nPull up, let it blink, nigga, I don't think (Oh)\nYour hood Titanic, we gon' make that shit sink (Straight up)\n\n[Chorus: 21 Savage, The Game]\nLive by the code, die by the code, never been a ho\nBury me before I sell my

I rock a L.A.

God bless\nOne love\nGood night. Or good day if you on the other side of the globe\nYo Just, we on the move with this shit\nDoctor's Advocate. See you on the third album\nHate it or love it"

Swizz? Lil Wayne?\nAR smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins\nAnd I just got a text from your mama\nSaying the water burst, I guess it's time for my karma\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalk through the door, she on the ground crying\nShe don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here\nI ain't cleaning that shit up!\nI finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator\nShe screaming, I left the car seat\nBut I'mma tell her later\nAww forget the car seat, man I'm hella-faded\nShe like \"I know you ain't high\" shit, I celebrated\nNow we in the car, she won't put on her seatbelt\nScreaming at the top of her lungs, \"God, I need help\"!\nWeaving through traffic, minutes between contractions\nClose your eyes right now, and you can see it happening\nImagine, she pulling on me \"stop I'm about to crash, shit!\"\nButterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit\nEvery time I have a kid, it's like the first time\nKids the best, but they be coming at the worst times\nNow we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair\nThem butterflies still here. Am I happy? Hell yeah!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost\nTrying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours\nThink, think damn, one of the nurses stuck they head out\nThey gave her an epideral so I pulled the couch bed out\nTook a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out\nShe grabbing on the rails, looking like she 'bout to pass out\nTold her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record\n\"Breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4 - one more - 2, 3, 4\"\nPush! C'mon Tig, push! God damn it, just push!\"\nNurse Linda coaching her, doctor arm a pulling on shoulders\nGiving me the notion to cut the umbilical cord\nShe out, 8 pounds 4 ounces, sayin' stop the beat\nHold up, I'm about to make a announcement\nSee, every time a child is born somebody leave the world\nSo I thank the woman that gave her life for my baby girl"

It appears to be a scene you might see in Operation Desert Storm and we've been seeing this all night\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's a trap, it's a trap\nWhy they ain't tell us red and blue don't matter when you black?\nMatter of fact we in blindfolds, bunch of lost souls\nKids shot dead in the streets, now they eyes closed\nHow you call the angels when it's kings getting beat up?\nAnd Gil Garcetti in his office with his feet up\nNo way to dodge police brutality\nSellin' crack cocaine, makin' a teacher's salary\nMexicans hoppin' the borders in the thousands\nBecome cholos, one button Pendletons, they stylin'\nCrips on the corner in Dodger blue with they gold chains\nBloods sportin' corn rows and Chucks with the red strings\nSun goin' down so them Chevys 'bout to roll out\nFiends scratchin' themselves, stumblin' out the dope house\nNiggas tyin' bandanas, 'bout to put the drum on\nKids tryna make it home 'fore street lights come on\n\n[Bridge]\nThe way we live is savage\nThe way we live is savage\nThe way we live is savage\nThe way we live is savage\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo grab that gun, load that clip\nGrab that torch, light that shit, grab that stick\nGrab that brick, throw it. it's time to riot\nIf you don't see black owned in the window, it's on fire\nStart here, end up over there\nThe smell of gun powder in the air\nAnd just so we clear, this is pain and despair\nWe burn our own shit and we aware and don't care\nTell the national guards to disappear\nWe got guns too and we ain't scared\nSo fuck the man, fuck the President Bush and his legislation\nShit gotta change, we ain't waitin', fuck patience\n'Cause the government corrupt, I can prove it\nMartin, Malcolm, Huey P. Newton\nAnd that's why the whole city out here lootin'\nHow can we stand here and not do shit?\nAll this smoke over the hood lookin' like low clouds\nCars with no miles on fire, they broke down\nWhite people wishin' that they was at home\nAsians frontin' like they business is Black-owned\nFar from stupid, we comin' in the stores trippin'\nRunnin' in swap meets for they Jordans and they Pippins\nCrowbars, bats, anythin' that break glass\nThey fucked Rodney King up and now it's they ass\nSo it's bottle rockets through the window\nKids that was never smokin' endo\nFiends kickin' in doors, stealin' Nintendos\nNiggas robbin' liquor stores with taped up \"Duck Hunt\" guns\nCity burnin' but it's fucked up fun\nNational Guard's on the corner\nThey don't know the hood, they foreigners\nWe was bustin' at the cops before Chris Dorner\nGhetto birds flyin' over the hood, they see us\nShowin' the fuck out, cleanin' the trucks out\nNiggas mobbin' down the streets pushin' big screens and baskets\nStarin' straight into the cameras, no ski mask\nJust pandemonium, niggas lootin' what they homies in\nRunnin' around with Scarface guns like they was Tony and them\nWho, what, where, when, how the fuck they gon' stop us?\nWhen the last 50 years we accustomed to window shoppin'\nSo we takin' lighters to the tip of magazines\nDip 'em in gasoline and set this motherfucker on (fire)\n\n[Chorus]\nThe whole world watchin', Los Angeles is on (Fire)\nYeah, yeah (Fire)\n1992, was you here for the (Fire?)\nUh-huh\n\n[Verse 3]\nStandin' on the corner with a brick in my hand\nWhen my mother told me sit in the van, nah fuck that\nFoot Locker chained up, wire cutters cut that\nNiggas Crip walkin' where Reginald Denny's truck at\nPolice cars, drivin' by niggas in slow mo\nIf you white don't stop at the light, 'cause that's a no-no\nRunnin' through the malls, give us everything Polo\nThe first time niggas ain't have beef with the cholos\n'92, fire lit the skyline, and why we loot?\nTo capture that forbidden truth 'cause Adam never ate the fruit\nFuck your blue suits, your badge, and them high beams\nWe out here sellin' chronic, we ain't have no Jimmy Iovines\nShit burnin', you gon' need more than Visine\nWe makin' a movie better than any one that I've seen\nShould be on Showtime, HBO, Cinemax\nGet a match, we gon' make sure that y'all remember that (Fire)\n\n[Chorus]\nThe whole world watchin', Los Angeles is on (Fire)\nYeah, yeah (Fire)\n1992, was you here for the (Fire?)\nUh-huh\n\n[Outro : Marvin Gaye]\nMake me wanna holla\nThe way they do my life\nMake me wanna holla\nThe way they do my life\nThis ain't living, this ain't living\nNo-no baby, this ain't living\nNo, no, no, no\nInflation, no chance\nTo increase"

Who gon' have to pray?\"\nNew York, New York; good morning LA\nMy nigga Hayes blew him and his wife away\n\n[Outro]\nThis song is dedicated to Stephanie Mosley, who was murdered from a single gunshot wound inflicted by her husband, Earl Hayes, in Los Angeles, California; December 18th, 2014\nI knew Hayes since we were both signed to Aftermath back in 2005\nAnd if I can keep it 8 more than 92 with you, he was a good nigga\nI never saw that coming\nMy prayers are with Stephanie's entire family\nI am truly and deeply sorry for your loss"

Hip Hop died\nWhere do we go now, when it's over?\nI'm lookin' all around\nCan this be, the aftermath?\n\n[Game: Verse 2]\nThe living, the dead\nThese Dre beats, my head\nMy life, featuring Wayne\nThat was Jayceon, this is Game\nAdjacent to the fame ain't chasing a damn thing\nSo tonight let all of your pain be champagne\nI can't tame my killers but I can tell them chill\nI might give you a pass depending how I feel\nThe bi polar bear\nThey said the end of the world is coming, I know it\u2019s here\nCuz California cold this year\nDetox, R.E.D\nMC\u2019s dead\nKill them softly like Lauren Hill\nSkin heads goin K-K-Krazy cuz a nigga in a foreign wheel\nWe all born to die, some of us born to kill\nIf that don\u2019t wake you up I hope tomorrow morning will\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Yelawolf: Verse 3]\nNever I thought I\u2019d see the day when I, would roll up in the parking lot\nAnd have people coming up to me for a photograph of the shit I talk about\nYela can I get an autograph Alabama so proud that we just can\u2019t wait\nCongrats on the Shady deal, any news on the release date?\nI told them what I can, shake another hand sign another autograph it\u2019s cool\nGot fans gettin inked up, dedicated to me I love you too\nGot 3000 sold, the spirit of rock and roll\nLong barrel .38 loaded I\u2019m John Wayne in Geronimo\nSo I dont really know whats got some these pussies panties in a ball\nCuz I never done shit but get better and believing in God\nAnd leaving my mom at 15 with a dream and a cross\nA cross that I didn\u2019t see until I was nailed to it for believing at all\nThat I could ever be accepted the way that I saw it\nI mean I knew it would be hard, but really come on y'all\nOh I\u2019m a redneck? FUCK YOU tatted on my neck\nI\u2019ll sip high life in a can at the Grammys now add that to my rep\nBitch!\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: The Game]\nYou see I wake up in the morning\nGrab my blunt and pull my dick up out this bitch mouth\nI'm feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something\nMultitasking, cooking breakfast\nMaking a nigga wanna smack that ass\nSee, I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride\nI said, \"If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive.\"\nCause I ain't, for, the tricking, no I ain't\nI'm with my main bitch and my side bitch, I'm feeling like Saddam\nThey had the bomb,\nAnd if her baby daddy tripping, fuck that nigga\nI push that nigga hairline back like he LeBron\nMake a nigga disappear like J-Kwon\nBody found by the Swans\nNigga missing both of his arms, I ain't playing\nI'm with the rat-tat-tat-tat, shoot a nigga if he do or don't die\nHe ain't never coming back\nNow it's one, two, buckle my shoe\nPatent leather Giuseppes nigga, watch what the fuck I do\nIt's the P-I-R-to-the-U\nAnd I put that on my momma I'ma ride for you baby boo\nYay yay, I said I put that on my momma I'ma ride for you baby boo\n\n[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]\nI hope you giving head today\nCause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)\nBaby we gon' celebrate, celebration\nYou bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one\nOne you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one\nI only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one\nBut you know I'm always open to suggestions\nI said let me be the one\nDown for you, it should never be a question, babe\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nDon't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time\nTo blow your mind, to blow your mind\n\n[Verse 2: DJ Quik]\nYeah, Quik is the name\nWith The Game, it's a goddamn shame\nNiggas can't see that we to blame\nFor putting Compton to flames\nIgnite it up, haters knotted up\nWhen you trip with canker sores in your whip\nThat's what I do, to protect my party\nMy goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy\nThen its back to shawty, all the ladies drink free\nAll the players grab a tab, that's how that's supposed to be\nDrinking Casamigos, fucking faster than grand national regals\nI'm in it in the pussy doing kegals\nI'm so Fred Segal right now\nShe so spread eagle right now\nAin't nothing but the clothes going down\nI'm in the game and the fire's the same\nMy music is infinite like even before my fame\nI wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses\nAnd I'm still coming off like this my first hit\n\n[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]\nI hope you giving head today\nCause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)\nBaby we gon' celebrate, celebration\nYou bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one\nOne you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one\nI only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one\nBut you know I'm always open to suggestions\nI said let me be the one\nDown for you, it should never be a question, babe\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nDon't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time\nTo blow your mind, to blow your mind\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nNow DJ Quik got a bitch from the Bay\nSay she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize\nYou ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?\nAnd had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?\nTreat my dick like a newborn, hold the head\nI told a bitch \"Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared\nSo stop that bickering,\" I got a bitch from the Nickersons\nThat got a fucking bounty on my head, uh oh\n\n[Verse 4: DJ Quik]\nI'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new\nSomething more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to\nSo lady, go on and work those hips\nLike them inmates work those divs\nAnd when I get there baby work your lips\nIf it don't make dollars don't holler\nIt's DJ Quik in any year Impala\nAnd if it don't make sense then don't flinch\nWhat you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass?\nNo shit\n\n[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]\nI hope you giving head today\nCause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)\nBaby we gon' celebrate\nYou bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one\nOne you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one\nI only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one\nBut you know I'm always open to suggestions\nI said let me be the one\nDown for you, it should never be a question, babe\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nDon't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time\nTo blow your mind, to blow your mind\n\n[Outro: DJ EZ Dicc (Ricky Harris)]\nShe's sucking on my dick\nShe's a bad, bad girl\nUh, h-hold on, hold on, baby\nYour head hit the button, girl\nWe on the li-\nZ-boy fro, yo man are we live?\nWe still live, huh?\nDamn girl, don't stop though\nHit you off with something brand new\nA Travis Barker produced joint, believe it or not\nHold on, let me hit this button"

Justo, will I fall off? Fuck no\nCalifornia mind nigga, pull it like a truck boat\nThese crips, these bloods, these es\u00e9s, they playin' cut throat\nYou a fish out of water, every MC gets slaughtered\nIf you ain't Nas, Eminem or fuckin' S dot Carter\nI tie up your wife, pull out my dick jack it off, kiss the knife\nBefore I cut her, take my jacket off, fuck her then hit the lights\nRub it in there like Detroit streets, with pictures of me\nFuck her till cops come, then I'm bustin' like\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhat the fuck is all this noise?\nHe from Cali, he can't rap\nHe ain't better than this nigga\nThat's my favorite artist\nFuck y'all, hear the breakdown\n\n[Freestyle]\nNo detox, I'm comfortable dog\nLike the solo Reeboks right up under me dog\nAnd it feel like I done it before\nSit in the throne pollutin the airwaves like a Hummer exhaust\nDon't let Makaveli fool you homie, thugging it costs\nPour out a little liquor for the loved ones that we lost\nYou ain't gotta wait for the album I don't fuck with The Source\nBut I turn up my Eazy-E and let it bump in the Porsche\nI mean turn up my B.I.G. and let it bump in the Porsche\nTell 'em to roll red carpet when he come in New York\nHip-hop police on me think they runnin New York\nTill I lace my Air1 show 'em how to run in New York\nThey tryin to take me downtown put me under the court\nCause Joe Buddens told 'em I carry a gun in New York\nAnd homey that's strictly fact, he got ripped on wax\nSo he snitched just to get me back\nNo matter what you say dog, your shit be whack\nYou better watch what you say, it might get you clapped\nHere's a little advice, homie: switch your raps\nCause that shit on your last album ain't get you plat\nWhat nigga you need a gun? I'll get you that\nP-89 nigga let Dre stitch you back\nIt ain't an industry, niggas I admit to that\nBut I don't even want your chain, I'll let the Crips do that\n12 bars for that bitch, he won't live through that\nEven a nigga with a ten year bid knew that\nPut a gun in his mouth yeah, yeah do that\nHe a pussy (sniff, sniff) his own kid knew that\nI'm Ready To Die, B.I.G. knew that\nHe ain't eatin, look at his white tee you could see his ribs through that\nYou cocksucker, let your ears do that\nOr ride later do me ooh wee now back to rap\n2 Lincoln Continentals sittin back to back\nLeavin' Jersey City naw nigga, Hackensack\nWhere's that? Somewhere where the crackers at\nReal far from where the roaches and rats is at\nCome to Compton I'll show you where the racquet's at\nDown the street from the Staples Center where they Hack-a-Shaq\nGive the advance money back, I ain't have to rap\nBreak Harry-O out tell him crack is back\nThat's nine five a bird take half of that\nImport it, export it in cracker jacks\nWhen you get to the projects, ask for Black\nYou know what you started with? Give him half of that\nHe gon give you 50 G's in a plastic sack\nAnd I'mma give you 3,500 cash for that\nGotta keep your mouth closed or I'mma blast the mac\nThey won't believe you the whole world know that bastard rap\nOnce you're out of the throne, you can't have it back\nRetirement home and ain't nothing after that\nExcept you layin' in a casket, black suit on\nYou can't go to heaven with Timberland boots on\nNo subliminals, I ain't talkin to you Shawn\nI'm talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on\nWho the fuck put you on\nFaggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons\nI fuck with Fab, get my DJ Clue on\nSit inside Hot 97 with no tools on\nAnd it don't matter if it's Sway or Kay Slay\nAngie Martinez I'll take 'em back to KDAY\nThey act like they forgot about Dre-day\nI don't rap for Free that's why they fired AJ\nIt's me leaking through your stereo\nEnvy me as an MC, prepare for your burial\nI kill niggas without lettin' the Desert blow\nRazor tongue and I'm far from Haitian son\nAll black like the Range Rover wheels\nNiggas whisper around The Game like The Game won't kill\nLet me show you the scars, take you back to the car\nRewind time, March 3, 1994\nI was only in my teens, deuce-deuce in my Levi's\nWhen Nas hit the scene I was still rockin' knee-highs\nRunnin' with my brother Fase, he was 17\nTwo guns in the upper waist, so we hit the block\nSaw niggas from a rival gang bumpin Dre\nRan up on the '64 and that's all she wrote\nWe runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin' Radames\nFirst murder and I did that without a mask\nFast-forward, see Game gettin out a Jag\nTwo piece suit on, he still got his rag\nGangbangin' forever, he still got his swag\nLet me catch you in Los Angeles without a pass\nEverybody in New York know that you a fag\nCome out the closet, show the world how to use a pad\nSpeakin' death on my red bandana\nNaw, he couldn't have said that, so I raised my antennas\nLook at my Nextel, got a call from Santana\nThat nigga a pussy, we just saw him in Atlanta\nSo I hopped on the first thing smokin' to Atlanta\nPulled up at 112 ran up on that black Phantom\nSecurity hopped out, no Joe in here\nJust Outkast gettin' ready for a show in here\nSo I uncocked the .44\nHopped in the cherry low-low\nChrome grill with the G-Unit logo\nWe watched Hov go, now the world waitin for my solo\nI'm the man, Stat Quo know\nI ain't gotta explain, even Bo know\nHalf of these rap niggas is faker than rolls gold\nGet hit in the face with the back of the .44\nAnd pissed on tryin to play The Game with a broke nose\nMy bitch harder than you, yeah Vida loco\nI ain't sold one record got rap in a chokehold\nI'm Dre certified like the leader of the band\nRun up, you sure to die, I'll leave you where you stand\nSmurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man\nBut he peed in his pants when he saw us at Summer Jam\nLucky I wasn't there, I had to bury my man\nOr I would've terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam\n\"What you mean terrorize New York?\"\nI mean expose these pussy ass niggas like I'm Too $hort\nSomebody tell Domination I'll leave him in parts\nLeg in Jersey, arm in Brooklyn, head buried in Central Park\nHe can't walk through New York no more like John Stark\nGot a call cause I'm a break his ankles like Hot-Sauce\nAsk niggas from your hood I'm thorough in 5 boroughs\nSit on any stoop, Pelli Tims in the thermal\nWait till Alpo come home\nLike Azie from Harlem, Dre gon' pay me regardless\nCause he know Jay-Z departed\nAnd these other rap labels know don't feed they artists\nTalkin blueprint shit you got three garages\nGettin money off Roc like little E and Carter\nShowin off your little chain like these is flawless\nSend him 50 cent a day I can see he starvin'\nI got R&B bitches givin' me m\u00e9nages\nDeep massages, I could hear Eazy talkin\nTellin me to have a seat in Tomica's office\nBuy Ruthless and get Lil' E involved in\nPromote without that magazine in Boston\nTake a couple mil, make Beans a offer\nGive him money we don't see that often\nBut it was all a dream, like I seen Memph Bleek in Marcy\nI ain't say you won't see Bleek in Marcy\nI said my man told me he don't see Bleek in Marcy\nI'm from Compton where niggas used to bleed for Barkley's\nDrive lo-lo's and we ain't need keys to start 'em\nJust a little information for your summer vacation\nBring your chain cause every nigga in L.A. waitin'\nMad cause Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers\nAnd they'll kill you cause they can't find Gary Payton\nMeanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band ain't makin' it\nShyne got a new deal, Def Jam gotta pay us\nPlayboy Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in\nNiggas got beef with G-Unit but ain't sayin' shit\nQuiet as a church on Tuesdays\nNiggas say they hate my music, but my alert's on they 2-ways\nNigga I'm a hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis\nTouch kids but I do that with a semi-automatic\nWith or without traffic I pull my shit out and blast it\nI'm blind to the masses like Stevie Wonder without glasses\nI'm a savage spit murder like a .38 Magnum\n16 bars'll baggum let the hook toe tag 'em\nMurder any MC throw 'em in that white wagon\nLet him die and come back look at 'em, he white flaggin'\nSpreadin' rumors like, \"When I see Game I might jack him\"\nI'm tellin' the world: he reach for my chain, I might clap him\nCause niggas shot me in 2001\nTook one in the heart cause I was too proud to run\nThe clip was empty when the police found my gun\nSo I don't bring that gangbangin' shit around my son\nNigga 50 took 9 he know how it feel\nAnd I found out Buck got shot up in Cashville\nAnd Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit\nAnd Yayo just came home (G-G-G-Unit)\nBackstage at a D-12 concert\nA fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoop's Converse\nNiggas show me love when they see me in the streets\nBut they frown when I don't want to hear none of they beats\nNigga, this shit crazy\nEm said some shit when was 16, now they tryin to ruin Slim Shady\nI forgive him, I got problems of my own\nHow you think the streets gon' act now that Suge got home\nThese niggas is birds, I can see the feathers on 'em\nIf Doc give me the word, I put this Berretta on 'em\nWhen the beef is on, my piece is on\nWhite sheets is on 'em, Doc breathin on 'em\nAnd I got an extra clip in my Reeboks\nCause I'm in and out my socks every time I see cops\nGame got the streets locked\nCall 911, get the whole fuckin LAPD shot\nNiggas snitchin' to the street cops\nGet your nephews and your niece shot\nWhen my heat cocked, then the beat stop\nNigga with a attitude like I heard Dr. Dre doin' \"Detox\"\nNiggas fightin' for the throne that ain't shit\nTryin to measure the fallin' legends but the shoe won't fit\nNiggas might think I'm ridin' dick\nCause I'm at the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Unit's\nTryin to talk to Jesus Christ into lettin' me dig 'em up\nSo they could stand side by side again and live it up\nThis might be the last time you hear me biggin 'em up\nWith \"Suicidal Thoughts\" bangin' me and my bitch in the truck\nMy conscience tellin' me if I put the clip in the buck\nIt might be loud enough to wake B.I.G and them up\nWhat if that was P. Diddy sittin' in the truck\nAnd 2Pac was in jail the day he recorded \"Hit 'em Up\"?\nI wouldn't be outside 40/40 bumpin' Jigga What\nWouldn't be signed to Dr. Dre, I wonder is it luck\nThey got me on MTV with Banks, Fifth, and Buck\nI ain't tryin' to be L.A.'s king, he carry a pimp cup\n\n[Outro]\nSnoop Dogg got the crown, nigga\nWhat the fuck y'all mad at me for?\nI ain't sold one fuckin' record\nI'm just tryin' to use these 200 bars to feed my family, nigga\nI ain't no threat\nI can't rap, I'm from Compton remember?\nYou gotta be out your motherfuckin' mind\nAsk Kay Slay, ask Clue, ask Whoo Kid, ask Funk Flex\nI'll murder anyone of you motherfuckers\nG-G-G-G-Unit"

(Why?)\nWhy you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (You were the greatest)\nYou were chosen from the start (Chosen, oh), never gon' let you go (Oh, oh, oh, God chose you, will never forget you)\nIt's from my heart, woah-oh (The King, we miss you)\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nWho's Michael Jackson? You're Michael Jackson\nI'm Michael Jackson, we all Michael Jackson\nI guess what I'm askin' is, everybody bow their head for a legend, don't breathe for a second\nNow let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about\nSo you can hear my message, my confession, somebody tell Usher\nI seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him\nLike he touched me, like he touched you\nSo carryin' his legacy, somethin' I must do\nAnd I trust you lightin' candles, concrete visuals\nMe and my brothers listen to Jackson 5 in the livin' room\nFirst thing I did when I heard, was call Puff\n'Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us\nWho was us? Me and 50, that beef is dead\nHim and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Boyz II Men]\nThis the type of song that make the angels cry\nI look up in the sky and I wonder why?\nWhy you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (Ooh yeah)\nYou were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go\nIt's from my heart, woah-oh (Oh, oh)\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nAs I'm pourin' out this liquor, candles start to flicker\nWhen list my Air Ones, MJ was my nigga\nNot the one that play ball, the one with the Hollywood star\nAnd since I'm a Hollywood star, I'ma tell you my story\nNever had a family that close\nNever see Berry Gordy walkin' through Interscope\nBut just like me, they always had Mike in a scope\nNo matter what you say, I'ma love him and he's still dope\nLet me take you back to '85 when I was in a zone\nDancin' for my mama, 'Thriller' jacket with all the zippers on\nNow i'm doin' 90, 'bout to crash in this Aston\nListenin' to Outkast, I'm sorry Ms. Jackson\nAnythin' I can ever do to better you\nYour son was our king so we won't Corretta you\nI'm writin' this letter to all the Jackson kids\nWe all Jackson kids, time to let us through\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Boyz II Men]\nThis the type of song that make the angels cry (Oh woah)\nI look up in the sky and I wonder why?\nWhy you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (Ooh yeah)\nYou were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go  (Oh, oh)\nIt's from my heart, woah-oh\n\n[Interlude: Diddy & Boyz II Men]\nPeople could say what they wanna say about you (Oh)\nWe gon' remember the miracles that you showed us (Oh)\nThrough your music, through your dance (Oh woah)\nThrough your philanthropy\nYou were the one that made us all realize that we are the world\nYou were the one to show us we can moonwalk (Yeah)\nYou gave us the beat (Hey)\nGave us the rhythm (Hey-ey)\nGave us the soul (Oh)\nThrough us, your legacy lives on (Anything)\nYou can't stop now, we won't stop now (Anything, oh)\nMike Jackson\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Boyz II Men & Diddy]\nThis the type of song that make the angels cry (Oh woah)\nI look up in the sky and I wonder why?

Who was born in Inglewood? Me\nTwo days left on Death-row is where I should be\nBut I'm right here waiting for her to wake up\nLike please don't die mama, wake up\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Game & Pharrell]\nMama told me stay away from them niggas (Chill blood)\nMama told me she had a K for them niggas (Chill blood)\nMama told me she go today for them niggas\nBut my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas\nThey just young, black and ignorant, lusting over models and them Benjamins\nGot the game twisted like (Like what?) Licorice\nWhen I was rocking lottos, moving packs up out McDonalds\nShe was looking for me, pulled up in that old El Dorado\nI was running around with chicks, chasing new black wheels\nWhy would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed\nBut I use that steel, cause I will do that deal\nScrew the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill\nWhat did I learn? Nothing, my pops smoking sherm, bluffin'\nBeating on my moms like her head was a percussion\nTap tap, my .45 knocking on your window\nShe said it would be days like this, Pharrell, drop the instrumental\n(Yessir)\n\n[Hook: Nelly Furtado, Pharrell & Game]\nI know I must go\nAnd I don't know my way\nStill somehow I know I'll end up\nWhere we all came from (From my mama's womb)\nI know I must go\nAnd I don't know my way\nStill somehow I know I'll end up\nWhere we all came from (From my mama's womb)\nI know\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nSwisher, crack a fifth up, Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls\nUsed to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball\nMoms working late night, to get our plate right\nHad some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play fight\nWish I could go back to them days cause streets don't play right\nSome niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid N Play type\nBut that ain't stop me pretending I was Apollo from Rocky\nWorking on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me\nPick and choose, stick and move\nSo many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news\nBut not my mama's son, known around the hood for serving customers\nShe yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler\nBut I didn't listen to, wish I would've trusted her\nWish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up\nLike, \"Here hug em, ma, one last time\"\nPut a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine\n\n[Hook: Nelly Furtado, Pharrell & Game]\nI know I must go\nAnd I don't know my way\nStill somehow I know I'll end up\nWhere we all came from (From my mama's womb)\nI know I must go\nAnd I don't know my way\nStill somehow I know I'll end up\nWhere we all came from (From my mama's womb)\nI know\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nPut your Glock down, recognize a king cause it's my town\nWord to my mother, you can throw up your rock now\nGot off the beef shit cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black\nRight there, crying over hard facts\nNow she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back, never!\nShe carried me for 9 months, so she can have whatever\nClever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas\nTold me that I'd be a king, so R.I.P. to Coretta\nIf you don't understand that, then refer to my letter\nWhile I sprinkle niggas with platinum from my last album\nGot the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm\nRiding through the hood, you hating niggas like \"How come\nThat niggas Game got it? Heard he selling talcum\"\nEither way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome\nYou might not like it, but my mama psychic\nWhy you niggas twisted like the top of a Sidekick? (Played out)\n\n[Hook: Nelly Furtado, Pharrell & Game]\nI know I must go\nAnd I don't know my way\nStill somehow I know I'll end up\nWhere we all came from (From my mama's womb)\nI know I must go\nAnd I don't know my way\nStill somehow I know I'll end up\nWhere we all came from (From my mama's womb)\nI know"

Yeah I can\n'Cause he been looking out for me before the Drake co-sign\nAnd I was there when him and Tune heard that Drake was gon' sign\nBut look at Drake now every time that I need something\nHe do it and say \"Game holla if you need something\"\nAnd that's loyalty in an industry that's full of snakes\nWhen niggas send a bottle to your table just to show they face\nAnd bitches standing looking pretty just to get a glass of Ace\nMost of these hoes dumb and ain't nothing but an ass and face\nBut if you are the ones thats lucky enough to stand up on this couch\nMake sure as soon as we hop in that Phantom you got them titties out\nI hate you fake hoes I swear I hate you fake hoes\nYour fake ass, your fake nose, you never gon' be J-Lo\nNicki put you on that Mike Kors got you thinking\nThat you on the right course to fuck the nigga in that white Porsche\nBut I got news for you, got a wifey and three kids at home\nAnd I can't even start to count how many times we've been to Rome\nMy oldest kid is 10 and some my youngest got his tennis on\nAnd you ain't never seen a 4 year old swaggin in his Foams\nNow they wanna be him 'cause he rocking colosseums\nUsed to rock it for the fiends now he rock with Europeans\nAll out in Dublin with them green bottles bubbling\nTwins I call doublemint, they calling me by my government\nI swear to god that I'm loving it\nI'm on the beach with Miss Dominican Republic\nEven she surprised that she sucking it\nBut don't be surprised that I'm fucking\nNever cuffing, always puffin', these bitches know who they fucking with\nI'm the fucking shit, handsome ass nigga\nFuck with me I'll fuck with her you gon' need ransom cash nigga\nNow cancel that nigga like my BlackBerry service\nDon't believe none of you niggas till them plaques start servicing\nNiggas get nervous when we hop out them Suburbans\nGet to tying red rags around our head like they turbans\nAfter niggas murk 'em, I'm behind the Phantoms curtains\nHeaded to Greystone, my alibi is this Persian\nHer alibi is this Asian, I call that a persuasion\nFrom Hollywood lock up to yelling out bring the spades in\nDumb bitch right here wanna know why the bottle green\nI'm something like them golf niggas, I done seen a lot of green\n640 mil 'bout to play the lottery\nA rich nigga can't win twice? Don't lie to me\n'Cause I'm Donald Trumpin,' Feds trying to eye on me\nAin't no limit in spending this money I'm bout it bout it P\nI'm who these new rappers trying to be\nEvery new nigga that say 'five' becomes a prodigy\nAnd you should honor me, hang my jersey up? Sure!\nWe got a situation, nigga Jersey shore\nKnow I'm 'bout my occupation, know I'm 'bout fucking these hoes\nKnow I rock them Louboutins and smoke til its stuck on my clothes\nAnd I got your girl in her comfortable clothes\nI'm 'bout to tickle her with what's right up under my nose\nIts money gang bitch, now watch my company blow\nAnd go from a hot logo to something you know\nI'm in the Maserati, Jordans punching the floor\nAnd you can act like you don't nigga, but...\n\n[Ending Verse: Mele]\nEither I'm going too fast or doing too much\nShut it down all the time when I'm in the club\nOoohhhh, ooohhhh\nYeah I'm always in the zone chilling with a bad bitch\nAnd she got nothing on, yeah I'm gonna do it, shut it down\nYeah I'm going too fast, so fast...."

Feedin my son is a must\nWhip it soft, whip it hard, in crack we trust\nWhy Andrew Jackson look high as fuck on the 20, G answer\nCocaine been around for centuries\nSince I'm young, black and rich, I'm the public enemy\nRidin the bass drum, Just Blaze got the remedy\n\n[Hook]\nI got the remedy\nAftermath got the remedy\nNigga back up (back up) back up (back up)\n'Fore you get your punk-ass smoked\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't no joke G, so don't provoke me\nI'm from the city of angels where that Jacob watch is a trophy\nAnd starin at that Hollywood sign'll get you straight jacked\n(Where you from fool?) Better say you pro-black\nCausin walkin in Roscoe's wit'cha chain hangin\nIs like Giuliani tryin to get rid of the gangbaners\nNow that 'Pac passed, tryin to put us on Death Row\nGet ready for the Aftermath\nI run through the city like Godzilla\nDoin mo' damage than Ice-T when he dropped Cop Killa\nPull a shotty out the trunk of the Chevy\nThere go another victim of a one-eight-seven\nWho's the grim reaper wit'cha life in his hand\nEven the toughest niggas run when my gun go... blam\nSo kick back and watch the bitches dance\nN.W.A. is back, now let me see your motherfuckin hands\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm back by popular demand and so\nAll black interior on the cherry red six-fo'\nNiggas endin they careers tryin to shut me up\nActin like I traded in my khakis for a button up\nThe West Coast still dippin\nGame still Bloodin, and Snoop still Crippin\nSo what you sayin loc? Red and blue bandana\nTied in a knot, as I creep through the chronic smoke\nThey say it ain't good weed if you don't choke\nShit got my head spinnin like the hundred spokes\nThree wheelin through the neighborhood\nSystem on blast, as the motherfuckin one-time pass\nThe key to drivebys is aim steady\nTurn that Bape hoody into motherfuckin confetti\nWhen you cross that enemy line\nClose your eyes, parental discretion is advised"

Hahaha\nThe city that never sleeps\nWe ain't talking 'bout money, we prolly will never speak\nLobby within a week, we generated revenue\nOld heads put me on the things that I never knew\nI'm big in New York, word to my moms baby\nAnd it's hard to be the Giant, just ask Tom Brady\nThat's why they pay me\nWhen you ask who the best right now, that's why they say me\nFred and The Game, peace, T.B.M., peace\n\n[Chorus: Sam Hook]\nThis right here reminds me of when\nThe playas had the dope so the girls brought their friends\nAnd every single night we did it again\nWe had a good time, we had a good time\nIn the city"

It's a hottie\nGoin' down on the up ramp, creep slow, back to the light\nI'ma kill 'em 'fore the end of the night\nTalkin' on my burner cell like, \"At he where?\"\nBack into a parkin' spot, handicap in the mirror\nCar door opens, my nigga out yells, \"Woo-Su\"\nWindows roll up, I'm thinkin' to myself, \"Who these niggas in this coupe?\"\nBack in the store, woods back in my hand\nSit 'em on the counter as he hands me back my Benz\nAnd says, \"Nigga my, you thank,\" I pass him a coke can\n10,000 goes back in my pocket in rubber bands\nBack to the whip in rewind, back to the spot\nWalkin' up the stairs backwards, the clip comes outta the Glock\nThe key goes back in the lock\nI walk in facin' out, take my shoes off and fall on the couch\nThis bitch takes my dick out of her mouth\nStands back up and tells me what her day was about\nWe hug as her clothes fly up to her hands, lip singin' B Cardi while she dance\nTapes Bundy Ted, credits roll down, chill and Netflix\nAs I unfasten the latch on my cuban link necklace\nShe gave me a second hug for the first time\nWalks outta the door back in the Uber as I'm cleanin' my .9\nI sit it down right next to my phone\nGo back to sleep and undream about Rihanna runnin' 'round in a thong\nWoke up tired and went back to the booth\nSample God's Sons, rewind it and wrote it backwards to a loop\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nListen up gangsters and honeys with your hair done\nPull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son\nDawg, whatever they call you, God, just listen\nI spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'"

He was 57 with no kids\nSo I'mma hug mine \u2018cause a nigga probably only got 21 more years to live\n21 more years to breathe\n21 more years to feel the sun rays\nTo fill collection pots up on Sundays\nAnd 21 more years to wake my kids up on Monday\nWe all die one day\nEverybody gotta go someday\nNatural causes or the gun play\nSince we was born we all been had it one way\nAin't no time to be askin' God why\nAnd ain't no tears man I'ma let the doves cry\n\n[Hook: Lorine Chia]\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nI see purple in the sky\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nFeelin' purple, might pour some lean today\nWhen God take a star, he make a star, yeah go on, dream today\nIn the red Corvette gettin' cream with the top down\nDiamonds and pearls all around your neck and that rain purple when it drop down\nYeah darling Nikki, I think its our time\nI want to be your lover, then we gon' party like it's 1999\nGet used to the pop life, we gon' live it\nCelebrate it like Pac's life, yeah who else wit' it?\nI remember watching Purple Rain when I was 5\nMy mom and dad fought the same way as yours, I ain't understand why\nAin't nobody perfect, ain't none of us the same\nWe all wanna leave the past behind us, sometimes we change our names\nWell we can't change who we are, can't take the pain away\nSo live your life and love your family, don't take the world in vain\nI'ma light one in your memory, \u2018cause the time has come\nThe world lost a legend, but he up there with his son\nSo I'ma pour up in your memory, \u2018cause the time has come\nThe world lost a legend, but he up there with his son\n\n[Bridge: Lorine Chia]\nUp there with his son\n\u2018Cause you're up there with your son\n\n[Hook: Lorine Chia]\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nI see purple in the sky\n\n[Outro: Lorine Chia]\nPurple in the sky\nMakes me wanna, cry\nPurple rain in your eyes\nI see you up there, shine\nYou shine\nWith the sun you shine\nPurple rain\nWhen it rains purple the sun will shine\nWhen it rains purple the sun will shine\nWhen it rains purple the sun will shine"

That nigga named Luda\nSlicker than Rick the Ruler, whoop ass like Lex Luger\nMy money long, your shit is shorter than Oompa Loompas\nAnd I'll Superman (youuu) that ass like Lex Luther\nShoot you then say \"me gusta\", I'll take you to meet ya maker\nMy dick's the Staples Center, I'll take you to see the Lakers\nSwish! On that Cali kush, smoking like a muffler\nSo many red flags I coulda swore I was in Russia\nGame! I got the fame and the fortune, Compton is scorchin\nGet rid of bullets, my gun keeps havin abortions\nI ain't havin it, see em in the dead zone\nFake dope boys is more bass up in my head phones\nAdjust your treble, I'm heavier than metal\nMy verses are hot as shit like I recorded with the Devil\nI'm on another level, they stuck on the elevator\nAnd I'm about to blow this bitch, Game press the detonator like\nFresh out of Georgia, ya heard I was back\nTurn on the radio, it's a rap\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nDon't you hear?\nDon't you hear the sound, sound?\nSaid don't you hear the sound?\nDon't you hear?\nDon't you hear the sound, sound?\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nSee I'm come from the bottom and they call me The Game\nBut I'm just happy that Beyonce know my name\nI took that Dr. Dre money and I bought me chain\nThen I bought me a house, then I bought me a Range\nThen I bought me some pussy, then I bought me some brains\nBut I ain't buyin' that the best rappers is Kanye and Wayne\nSee both of them niggas spit, but y'all act like you don't hear me spit\nLike sellin' seven million records ain't the shit\nI don't win no Grammys, nigga I'm too gangsta\nAnd poppin Cristal with Irv, don't make me a wanksta\nSee I'm California certified, my niggas make the murder rise\nRead my fan mail in jail, Buck told Curtis bye\nSo I'ma break it down, for them niggas in the South\nSlow it down, put this Rolls Phantom grill in my mouth\nThrow the Prada slippers on, when I walk in my house\nP. Diddy and Tommy Lee know what I'm talking about\nSee I'm fresh out of jail, I know you heard I was back\nTurn up the radio, it's a rap\n\n[Outro: Sample]\nDon't you hear?\nDon't you hear the sound, sound?\nSaid don't you hear the sound?\nDon't you hear?\nSaid don't you hear the sound?"

The whole hood is mad\nThat ain't the first time, won't be the last\nSee reflections of my past while I guzzle through this glass\nMake me want to run up on you with the muzzle, \"Where the cash?\"\nRetaliation is none, niggas can't afford the gas\nGot a mansion in the Hills, Rottweilers by the gates\nRed Ghost's in the driveway and ducks by the lake\nSpendin' time with my daughter so them ducks gotta wait\nLet a nigga call her a duck, he gon' eat a thirty-eight\nI'm supposed to be this fuckin' rich\nI'm supposed to be this fuckin' great\nI'm a menace to society, no Larenz Tate\nBut me and my niggas straight and\n\n[Chorus]\nMy bills are paid\nAnd everything's okay\nIt's like every day\nSummertime in L.A\n\n[Outro: The Game]\nDJ Skee"

This shit is even new to me (Word)\nI got with Game, I got in the game, and I could chew a piece\nOf this fresh cooked filet, I could eat it every day\nBut I swear this the beginnin', I be dreamin' every day\n\n[Chorus: King Marie]\nI just wanna be a dreamer\nI just wanna be a king\nI just wanna get lost\nI just wanna be me, I just wanna be free\nI just wanna be\nI just wanna be\nI just wanna be"

'cause she don't want no drama\nI'd rather take your ass to the Bahamas\nThan give you thirty thousand a month like Diddy, baby momma\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]\nI know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl\nBut I'm just tryin' to get my money right\nSo unless I'm done we could take a flight\nSo I can take you all around the world\nPlanes, trains, automobiles\nBentley or a Range, chromed out wheels\nFirst class ticket, G-4, you that deal\nFor real (I can take you all around the world)\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nPicture me thuggin'\nPicture me lovin' you like Bobby love Whitney\nNow picture me fuckin'\nPullin' your ponytail, smackin' you on the ass\nTellin' you how (I can take you all around the world)\nThat nigga can't do it like this\nEven Beyonc\u00e9 couldn't move it like this\nShe only fuck with soldiers, that's her shit\nI hate to admit it but I love my bitch so much\nI'm sittin' outside in the Benz\nThinkin' back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend\nThe pussy wasn't nothin'\nNow I'm dealin' with the diary of a mad black woman with Louis Vuitton luggage\nShe told me she was tired of the Game and rap\nQuit like Ma$e then she came right back\nI told you the bitch sex was whack\nAnd you're all I need, even Jamie know that\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]\nI know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl\nBut I'm just tryin' to get my money right\nSo unless I'm done we could take a flight\nSo I can take you all around the world\nPlanes, trains, automobiles\nBentley or a Range, chromed out wheels\nFirst class ticket, G-4, you that deal\nFor real (I can take you all around the world)\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nYou know what they say, \"more money, more problems, more drama\"\nMeans more marijuana and less baby momma\nYou know I love you like I love my shoes\nBut even white Air Force ones come in two's\nYeah, I like her and I like you too\nWhat's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo\nShe got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley coupe\nShe take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school\nI gave you the Birkin bags so I made a mistake\nAnd Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway\nI'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through\nBut I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu\nWhy we always gotta argue about Superhead's book\nShe sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook\nAnd when she start talking about buying a ring\nI just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]\nI know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl\nBut I'm just tryin' to get my money right\nSo unless I'm done we could take a flight\nSo I can take you all around the world\nPlanes, trains, automobiles\nBentley or a Range, chromed out wheels\nFirst class ticket, G-4, you that deal\nFor real (I can take you all around the world)"

You know me I keep one rolled up\nSmoking with my bitch from overseas, where my Porsche from\nAnd these hating niggas get no love\nI be rolling weed, getting rich, fucking they bitch\nLetting you spend all of your M, you send her on trips\nI meet her there, you know, cuase you smell the weed in her hair\nYou worried bout me cause we keeping it player, instead you failed\nTreated her fair, don\u2019t need to look, she in the air\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nStanding on the corner, talking that shit\nYou ain\u2019t really saying nothing, just hating on pimpin'\nEvery time i\u2019m in my car i\u2019m smoking that green\nEven though this real life, its like a movie scene\nI ain\u2019t in the club, if I don't blaze up\nIt don\u2019t matter where I go, I\u2019m throwing my gang up\nNobody used to know me but but\nNow a nigga famous, now a nigga famous"

You kids get to bed I'll get the story book...\n\nHere we go...\n\n[Game]\nSlam the impala door hopped out what do you see\nSome niggas hangin' on the fence lookin' at me\nI had phat red laces in my Adidas\nBig chain around my neck like mardi grass\nSo I stepped up to them is there a problem here?\nOne nigga lifts his shirt then he yells out \"yeah\"\nSo I turned around quickly and jumped in my car\nI was about to hit the switch then I thought like \"nahh\"\nSo I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit\nIt was a chrome four five with the kung fu grip\nStuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car\nKept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the store\nOne nigga walks in, then here comes two\n\"what did you do?\"\nI shot!\nAre you crazy fool?\nOne nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed\nNow the cops are outside\nWell i'll be damned\nIt was 7:15 on my rolex watch\nAnd I can't do the time that my rolex got\nAnd like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way\nRan around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away\nAnd impala passes, its my homeboy clyde\nHe gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride\nIt was a clean six fo, original inside\nWith no key in the ignition\nWhere'd you get this clyde?\nNevermind, I'm out, its a stolen whip\nAnd I'm already runnin' from the cops and shit\nSo I hopped out the car like the Dukes of Hazzard\nThen clyde yells out \"you stupid bastard\"\nStart runnin though traffic and I almost get hit\nI lost one of my shoes, its my airforce, shit\nI'm haulin down the street with one shoe on\nWalked straight into some niggas with all blue on\nI only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in long beach\nCause in california the gangs in arms reach\nHe seen my red strings so he punched and caught me\nSo I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his barklys\nI ain't seen these since 92'\nI'm feelin like a bad boy without the shiny suit\nHere the cops come, shit, so I dash behind a honda\nAnd look who's here my baby momma's friend Rhonda\nIn the car kissin on this dope dealer, Chris\nLittle did he know he was suckin my dick\nI start bangin' on the window, I don't mean to disturb\nBut Chris can you drop me off downtown, on third\nHe said why sure, waddup game hop in\nHe was bangin slick rick then I got an idea\nBefore we get to third drop me off right here\nSo I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear\nAs I walked in the store they could see I was in a rush\nSo they bought me some jeans, a t-shirt and fresh chucks\nWalked out the store, looked left, oh no\nRan back in the store, here comes the 5-0\nSo I ran real quick, made a move to the back\nAnd knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack\nSaid sorry, jumped over her and fled to the back door\nThen I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw\nIts the nigga chris in handcuffs, pointin at me\nAnd the cops made him chase me before they let Chris free\nOne cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed\nI got away with more time, and they both got pissed\nRan straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe\n'dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be Snoop\nSo I ran up the car and said yo snoop\nThe cops got me on the run need a ride nephew\nHell yeah bigg snoop, little homie hop in\nHe dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends\nNow this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh\nJust another story about the wrong path\nI had a big day, so I reclined my seat\nIt was a 20 minute ride to the C.P.T\nWalked straight up to the house, pulled out my key\nOpened my door it's my girl playin..."

hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\nThree-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\n\n[Verse 6: The Game]\nMy 64 sittin on that chrome, chrome Glock sitting on my lap\n2 hoes ridin in the back, candy paint, nigga fuck with that\n3-wheel motion, I'm sitting high, daytonas, that's all we ride\nHit that switch its do or die, ride on me that's suicide\nI be in the hood smoking that green, Dr.Dre know what I mean\nSwisha sweet and them purple leaves, California, we got that weed\nBlack diamonds off in my chain/ ask around nigga know my name\nCompton own, the rap Lebron James, ridin low, I'm switchin lanes\n\n[Verse 7: W.C.]\nMake that brain splat 30 thang thang clap\nKnow for the game rap with the chrome frame wrap\nFrom Harley Davidsons to low lows, we do tip 'em\n13 hundred spokes with that blue nibble get the picture\nDisrespect and I'm draw slugs\nBut ain't no set trippin cause nigga its all love\nDub C drop the real on 'em, chevy chrome grill on 'em\nPosing in the intersection, 3-wheelin on 'em nigga\n\n[Verse 8: Ice Cube]\nRasberry 64 bring your cherry\nAnd we could make a Sunday, come home Monday\nI'm sittin on the one-way, up on the Boulevard\nAct hard, put ya thoughts on the dashboard\nCause if I come through the hood with the little homie\nNobody better fuck with the little homie\nI hope Compton unite, South Central unit\nI hope my chrome, and dance with the moon light\n\n[Chorus: The Game]\nCherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\nThree-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\n\n(This has been a Chops production)"

Dodgers kid's at\nThat's where my shit's at\nNiggas want my life homey come get that\nI'm tired of the rif-rat\nNiggas better sit back\nCause when the guns come out they break like kit-kats\nBut if its beef break me of a piece\nI eat that beat that i'm back on the streets\nI got a whole lot of bitches to see\nAnd i don't fuck any dub niggas bitches to me\nAnd a bitch is a bitch thats just a simple fact\nNext time I'm in town you gonna get me jacked\nSend the baby daddy see how the kids react\nWhen the daddy comes home and his ribs is cracked\nAnd he files a lawsuit for a million flat\nFuck it I gotta deal wit that\nThat's just how it is\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nDre ridin' again\nWestside again\nGo get your ties again\nYou muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation\nIf you come back then we go again\nDre ridin' again\nWestside again\nGo get your ties again\nYou muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation\nIf you come back then we go again\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nGuess who's back again\nStraight out the C.P.T\nD.O.C. D.R.E\nY'all know me wit the shit bangin'\nI'm in the streets again\nThis west coast shit gettin' played again\nIts a new season and\nA lot of people waitin'\nA lot of niggas hatin'\nWhole lot of stipulation\nIt's Dre makin the beats\nPuttin' riders on the floor\nI gets dope I'm the Aftermath C.E.O\nHalf the world wanna see me flow\nThe other half wanna see me go\nIt won't happen muthafuckas\nDre still rappin muthafuckas\nThe streets still love him\nPaid in full since \"Deep Cover\"\nAll three speakers still drumming\nBeats still coming\nComptons version of \"Feel Drumming\"\nSame Dre different strokes\nSame six-tre different spokes\nSame chronic just different smoke\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nDre ridin' again\nWestside again\nGo get your ties again\nYou muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation\nIf you come back then we go again\nDre ridin' again\nWestside again\nGo get your ties again\nYou muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation\nIf you come back then we go again\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nIt ain't easy being signed to Dre\nI'm in the press so much I ain't got time to pray\nIt's been six months too long\nAftermath gotta move on\nNow the beef wit me and 50 Cent gone\nI told y'all not to fuck wit me\nGhost writer my pens got that Murder Inc\nI feel kinda bad about \"murdering\" Ja\nWhat goes around comes around look at 50's shot (a'ight a'ight)\nBut fuck that never mind that shit you did\nYou tryin' to sell albums I'm just tryin' to feed my kid\nGame, you gonna respond to Mr. Potato Head\nI told I'm just tryin' to feed my kid\nWhy scoop to a level that requires a shovel\nThat's like throwing ice cubes at the muthafuckin' devil\nI left the group cause the group's too crowded\nNow watch Game finish his second album without him\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nDre ridin' again\nWestside again\nGo get your ties again\nYou muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation\nIf you come back then we go again\nDre ridin' again\nWestside again\nGo get your ties again\nYou muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation\nIf you come back then we go again\n\n[Outro]\nAftermath!\nGame time\nGame time"

Watch me, who the fuck gon' stop me?!\nI know Andre Young wish he left me where he got me\nDay after they shot me I was walkin' out the swap meet\nCrutchin' on my left arm, niggas tried to Pac me\nAll they did was make me stronger\nWanna, gangbang longer, had to\nCreep inside of Slauson make my, chain hang longer\nBunny hop into that Range with the thang-thang on him\nRed flag wavin', oh you tryin' to bang-bang on him?\nMonkey nuts banana clips with that, orangu-tang on him\nKing Kong ain't got shit on me, it's training day homie\nPull up\n\n[Chorus]\nOh you think you bangin'-bangin'?

Nike backpack on, you know like Durant be wearing. Nike straps tighter than a virgin pussy Illmatic in the Walkman, what?\n\nSitting on the subway they looking like \"who is that?\"\nThe boy gutter all hood New York sewer rat\nYou can never mace me, where Cuda at?\nThey love me out in Harlem like a ten dollar buddha sack\nI spit that Ill Street Blues, yeah Kool G Rap\nBut my style is big, where the Coogis at?\nI said my style is Big now light a L\nAs I skip to the next track on Supreme Clientele\nGhost to Manhattan, seat reclined in the Aston\nTom Ford glasses cause NY is into fashion\nMadison. Square. Garden. Feeling like Spike Lee's squares, Jordans\nYou squares ain't important\nFresh to death my gear's in a coffin\n*cough cough* Why that nigga coughin'?\nBlowing that sour diesel I ain't be here that often\n\nRiding on the A train, listening to Ghostface\nI'm just ridin on the A train, listenin to Ghostface\nRiding on the A train, listening to Ghostface\nI'm just riding on the A train, listening to Ghostface\n\nPull up in that Derrick Rose hop out number nines or elevens\nYou niggas is copycats, my style is patent leather\nSouth side of the Chi nigga I ain't packing never\nI ain't shy of the Chi, Jay Cutler in cold weather\nAnd all I do is win, 72 and 10\nBall like Mike, Scottie, Dennis Rodman and them\n7-4 Chevelle, niggas riding in them\nKillers from Cabrini-Green, I was riding with them\nPelle jackets niggas out here robbing in them\nAnd even getting coat-jacked ain't Common to him\nKeep thinking you Larry Hoover that line'll have you shook\nThat's that Crack Music nigga forgot I was on the hook\nG.D.s, Vice Lords, Four Corner Hustlers\nLatin Kings, MCs, all em will fuck with us\nBlowing trees like the windy city\nNigga I blow trees in the Windy City\n\nRiding on the L train, listening to Kanye\nI'm just riding on the L train, listening to Kanye\nI'm just riding in on the L train, listening to Kanye\nSaid I'm riding on the L train, listening to Kanye\n\nI be in Lil Haiti\nFirst forty eighty\nAin't nothing bout to go down nigga my fam's Zoe Pound\nAnd ever since they locked my nigga Zo down\nEverything slow down, but my nigga Ross is on\nThe homie Khaled put the Boss's on\nWe blowing orange like the Dolphins home\nAnd we don't floss the chrome\nWe turn that Wildcat offense on\nThat New Era fly off ya dome\nI'm about to take my talents to South Beach\nI don't even go to the games, but got Heat\nAin't no Trickin Daddy, I take a bitch to get some Cuban food\nHave a couple mojitos then fuck her like a Cuban do\nRiding down Collins in the newest coup\nFlo-Rida on the place, they think I'm Uncle Luke\nNigga Tony Montana, who the fuck is you?\nI'm the all-red side of the Rubik's Cube\n\nRiding in the fast lane, listening to Rozay\nI'm just ridin in the fast lane, listening to Rozay\nRiding in the fast lane, listening to Rozay\nI'm just riding in the fast lane, listening to Rozay"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Game]\nLife ain't fair and sometimes it get black\nLike the Nike Airs and that's when I go back\nBack where? to the block where the dreams never stop\n'Cause its hard to dream when your dream was being on top\nAnd you already there..so you look down into the City and see\nLife ain't what it used to be\nKids fantasize about how a Phantom rides\nIf you attract a star then welcome to the enterprise\nHop in a spaceship and fly..fly away\nPass the clouds where Marvin Gaye and 2Pac stay\nAnd never wanna come back like Jam Master Jay\nMatter fact, close your eyes and just pass away\n\n[Chorus: Mars]\nIf you could see straight through my eyes\nIf I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye\nIf you could take one thing with you what would it be\nOh, If you, could be, with me\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nYou wouldn't be hearin' this if it wasn't for Lupe\nHe inspired what I wrote bought his album today\nThen I threw it in my car and let the CD play\nYou are a Superstar is what the CD say\nAnd on the eve of this morning I'm like Stevie J\nMaking love to the music like when Stevie play\nWhen I rap the 'hood listen, ghetto T.D. Jakes\nAnd the Devil tried hard just to see me break\nThat's when I switch switch cars and I cross my heart\nKnowing that I'm God's Son like the belly of Nas\nI used to dream hard about being in Belly with Nas\nEven the ghetto Mozart couldn't play that part\nLike the Eli Manning's when they play that hard\nEverybody ain't a Giant but they play that card\nAnd that card is dealt and then blows are felt\n:ike a Mayweather jab that lands below the belt\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: Mars]\nIf you could see straight through my eyes\nIf I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye\nIf you could take one thing with you what would it be\nOh, If you, could be, with me\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nLight a candle in the dark and lead yourself to the light\nAnd when you there blow it out so you can sleep through the night\nThe Sun rise in the morning and your future get bright\nBright as the ice in my ear it's like a movie premiere\nAnd you can be Denzel here's your Oscar tip\nIf you can memorize your lines without reading the script\nThen you can walk through the forest while you standin' still\nYou might get lucky like Forrest 20 million a film\nAnd with that, you can buy yourself a football field\nBuild a field of dreams for kids who got that skill\nMarry a legend like Jada did if you got that Will\nBut laugh now cry later if you pop that pill\nSeemed fun for a moment but it's not that real\n'Cause your life is ice cold and you got that chill\nSo tomorrow when wake and you spin that wheel\nJust remember what I told you from on top that hill\nIts real\n\n[Chorus: Mars]\nIf you could see straight through my eyes\nIf I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye\nIf you could take one thing with you what would it be\nOh, If you, could be, with me"

(The Doctor's Advocate)\nLet the sun roof back and I keep on coastin\u2019\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\n\nI can hear niggas talking, whispering in the dark they're like dogs with no bark\nWhen I pull over and park then guns starts to spark and the bullets find the mark\nNiggas outlined in the chalk and I speak from the heart\nWhen I say I killed you, it's simple and plain\nDon't say shit about Dre and don't mention The Game\nThis industry is fake and I can't understand how a grown ass man\nSent a bitch to the pen, how you snitched on stan; he's a bitch like his man\nHe'd of did you for a grand. Eminem called him stan\nI'm going to say it again\nIf I had one more chance I would've break all of his ribs with my bare fuckin' hands\nI'm a gangsta on fire\nYou ain't, you a liar\nYou ain't got no pride, there's a snitch in the wire\nYour fan base knows that you're gangsta is dying\nI won't stop until that wanksta retires\nI'm gone\n\nThese niggas had a chance, now their shit is over\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\nDon't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\n24 low on hearts on that '06 rose\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\nLet the sun roof back and I keep on coastin\u2019\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\n\nThese rap niggas hate and they smile in my face\nYou rabbit niggas mad, cause the turtle won the race\nAnd, the radio debate what the fuck they going to play\nAll the hot shit is my shit; they take what I say\nPlay Scrabble with my words and put it on the front page\nThey go find a picture of 50 and Game\nSay it's East vs. West; New York and L.A\nSince I dont' button up, now I'm beefin' with Jay\nApologize in seconds\nYou niggas is reckless, you're not going to pay me to beef with a legend\nMy pride I'd protecting, the streets I'm respecting\nI'm not trying to replace Pac so accept\nAfter 5 million records; the Dr.Dre lectures; and 3 world tours\nWest Coast Resurrected\nMy form to the group of help was rejected\nI felt abandoned so I threw away my necklace\n\nThese niggas had a chance, now their shit is over\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\nDon't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\n24 low on hearts on that '06 rose\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\nLet the sun roof back and I keep on coastin'\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\n\nAfter 20 magazines and a couple of awards\nI can close my first chapter; put my plaques on the wall\nTo the top of the billboard\nWho ever knew that I would sell more than Destiny Child and U2?\nOr do a song with Busta, go neck and neck with Usher?\nWent gold in a week, I'm a bad mutherfucka\nThis Gangsta Disciple and Vice Lord shit\nBrown pride, Latin King\nThis is Blood, this is Crip\nHit the Impala switch\nI keep a clip for any nigga that said I fuck his bitch\nOr changed cause I'm rich, saying Game used to strip\nNiggas weren't saying shit until I came with a hit\nNow you want to see me dead, blood stains in his whip\nTake a father from his son, put my name in cement\nAfter I'm gone they're sample my songs\nYou can bury my bones but my music lives on\n\nThese niggas had a chance, now their shit is over\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\nDon't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\n24 low on hearts on the '06 rose\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\nLet the sun roof back and I keep on coastin'\nIt's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn\n\nAye yo, man, I don't really give a fuck about all that shit ya'll doing, that shit ain't making no noise. I'm saying that shit is bullshit. Man, why you niggas trying fucking kill my mutherfucka career? Man, Shit! It ain't going to happen, nigga.

Think it was horse and carriage\nBut I ain't talkin' marriage, I'm talkin' fourteen karats\nI ain't talkin' Tiffany cause I ain't talkin' industry\nI'm talkin' in the streets, twin Bentleys\nI'm tryna be with you mentally before physically\nOr physically before mentally, just remember me\nFor you I'd let that thing like a symphony\nSid and Nancy or Mickey and Mallory we meant to be\nNever been a trick, I do the shopping for both us\nSend shots at these vultures in these Mark Jacob loafers\nI'm sayin', you gon' let me see somethin'? Stop playin'\nI didn't know it was like that goddamn\nYou bring the LL out a nigga\nThe Louis V, the Berkin and Chanel out a nigga\nJ12 out a nigga, so you know what time it is\nI'm 'bout to call the realtor, yo ma, where you tryna live\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nPushin' it, your lips\nCause my drug is your kiss\nI'm pushin' it, your body\nYou're beautiful, vaginal\nI'm pushin' it, back door\nI wanna elevate ya to the top floor\nI'm pushin' it, need a rush\nThe way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nWhat's happenin' mommy? What you doin'? You supposed to be\nLivin' in the life of luxury so you should go with me\nI\u2019m overly excited, spend the night, I bet you like it\nDo with it whatever you like , it don't matter, just don't bite it\nYou see that feeling you had when you met me, we you shouldn't fight it\nThey said you and I or more than worth a try, so don't deny it\nSee, I'm King like Leonidas, dress your hands with the brightest\nStones known to man when your man's pockets on a diet\nBrought you in this presidential, out that double in the Hyatt\nBig money talkin', all broke niggas be quiet\nIt don't matter how he feels, all that matters how he live\nDon't listen to his opinion till he stack a couple mill\nBut until then feel free to come chill\nIn my crib in the hills sit back kick off your heels\nSaid you never seen a pad with a view so ill\nOr receive so much pleasure that you couldn't hold still\nWell until\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nPushin' it, your lips\nCause my drug is your kiss\nI'm pushin' it, your body\nYou're beautiful, vaginal\nI'm pushin' it, back door\nI wanna elevate ya to the top floor\nI'm pushin' it, need a rush\nThe way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch\n\n[Bridge: Robin Thicke]\nStraight to the penthouse, elevate\nLet me put my hands on your w-w-wait\nLet me take a second, let me take it in\nYou can run that game all night, but you know I'll w-w-win\nI'm superman, I'm super cool\nI'm breathin' air all over you\nI'm superman, I'm super cool\nI'm breathin' air all over you\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nI let your friends talk bad about you, I didn't kn-izzo\nBehind your back callin' you a H to the izzo\nI apologize, lay your head on my pillow\nMr. and Mrs. Smith and we can have a little Willow\nShe can shave the sides, put a couple lines in it\nAnd we can have spritzers put a couple limes in it\nThrow a Bar Mitzvah put a couple dimes in it\nShe go see a Drake show but never out of line with it\nSo every chance I get, nigga I'm in it\nDeep sea divin' tryna see what I can find in it\nSo it's mine in'it, and that's a Porsche ain't it\nSo picture that and have Andy Warhol paint it\nI'm a rude boy so I'ma go and get it up\nRihanna post Chris, Matt, Kim, baby this is us\nSo talk to me, have you ever been to Cannes\nYeah, south of France, next stop Japan\nLet's go\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nPushin' it, your lips\nCause my drug is your kiss\nI'm pushin' it, your body\nYou're beautiful, vaginal\nI'm pushin' it, back door\nI wanna elevate ya to the top floor\nI'm pushin' it, need a rush\nThe way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch"

Kidd or the yellow and purple\nThe harder the nigga, the harder the work is\nSo I get high and listen to Pac's first shit before I write verses\nI'm the Shaq on the block, Kobe with the rock\nWest with the shot, so nickname my johnson \"Earvin\"\nDon't get murdered\nI got a Glock in the holster\nThat'll blow your fucking brains off the top of your shoulders\nDog, I keep it gangsta like I'm supposed to\nWith a 12 guage shotty and that Testarossa\nNWA soldier, I'm no good, I'm so hood\nHolla if you wanna die that bad, I bust guns that fast\nAnd I rock my rag, like it's 88 and niggas still rockin' Shaft\nSo put the hundreds in the bag\nOr I'ma put the eagle to your helmet\nAnd the 5th to your chest like Donovan McNabb\nI keep 16 in the clip, and I'll let em' all go\nLike The Lakers did Elton, Eddie and Nick\nWe got bricks for 11.5, So many fiends\nIt's like a nigga been on the same corner since '75\nNWA will never die\nAnd I'm Compton's most wanted\n100 bars and runnin!\n\n[Outro]\nLook what the fuck the wind blew in\nYo Clue, you better let em' know, nigga\nThis is Aftermath's young gun\nOh, you thought it was hard to get a deal on the west before?\nWelcome to them fucking record labels now\nIf you ain't spitting like The Game\nAnd 10 bars or less, your shit is a frisbee, nigga\nSo you better be concerned\nThis is Chuck Taylor, muthafucka\nAnd I'll bring the west coast back by myself if I got to\nYou don't believe me?\nAsk the nigga standing next to you\nSee what the fuck he got to say\nHolla"

Dep\nTryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet\nBetter have that Glock stuffed tonight\nI'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it\nA block bust tonight\n\n[Hook 2X: The Game]\nGetting American Money Easy, all I know\nThe Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough\nIt's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out\nShots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts\n\n[The Game]\nLace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas\nYou can't ball? Then it's probably the haters\nCan't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not\nI give a fuck dog, bullets is hot\nAnd every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain\nThe more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit\nAnd your niggas ain't gon' ride for shit, they know\nIf they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit\nRed rag or blue rag, niggas die for this\nThe Game the reason all these niggas on that \"Cali Love\" shit\nCompton niggas get grimy too, pull you out of that 6\nFuck you up like one time'll do\nAnd I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard\nComin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw\nTurn your round trip into a one-way ticket\nYou can visit, but you can not lie and kick it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Noble]\nAiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop\nPointin fingers at them niggas, that kept shit hot\nNext to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out\nOutlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out\nLearn about your whereabouts and we right there\nMe and Game have you left right there\nN-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z\nWe bubble with ease, and I double my cheese\nI got niggas out in Compton that'll find yo' ass\nI got niggas out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass\nFor a long time if you ever fuckin with mine\nIt's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud\nWe killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard\nYou the type of motherfucker standin next to the God\nThe Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets\nYoung Noble and the homey Game flamin heat, c'mon\n\n[Hook]"

My brother is Mafia, yea I got family in inglewood\nWelcome to Killafornia, its where I live\nThe zip code is 187 and the city is\n\nMurda Murda, leave mine alone\nBetta mind your own,(the reds)\nMurda murda, When the heat is on\nBetta ride with chrome(or its)\nMurda Murda, If that beam is on\nYour life is gone in it\nMurda"

How will it ever end\nWhen men killin men over women in 600 benzes\nPray for the haters near me\nUntil I'm laid and buried\nThese are hoop dreams and the court is my sanctuary\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Fades out with Hook]"

See that black semi\nBlood spillin' blood on them black pennys nigga that's gutter\n\n[Hook]\nGutter, gutter\nNigga that's gutter\nGutter, gutter\nKeep it gutter\n\n[Verse 2]\nGuess that's my mind frame\nNiggas can't kill me cause they ain't tryna find Game\nEven if they was I'm at the Staples, Louis Vuitton frames\nFeet on the wood, nigga I could trip Lebron James\nI keep it hood\nBandana with that bang bang\nRed rag .45, that's the same thing\nI take the same route home in the same lane\nSame car, same nigga, just the fame changed\nI walk around like I never heard the same Game\nWatch Menace 2 Society became Caine\nThen I became king leader of the chain gang\nStill park my Rolls Royce and hop back on the same train\nThen hop out on the same street\nWhere the dealers and the fiends eat\nWhere the killers and the everything in-between meet\nGet your face covered with that white sheet\nThat nigga died over Twitter beef\nTryna keep it gutter\n\n[Hook]\nTryna keep it gutter\nKeep it gutter\nTryna keep it gutter\nGutter, gutter\nNigga that's gutter"

North Kakalak freaks\nAnd the shit we be smokin' could melt the Mac off they cheeks\nThen we headed to that magic city, he ain't seen no ass and titties\nIn about a decade, these hoes about to get paid\nThey took him to the back, I ain't seen his ass in two hours\nTwo time felon taken a shower in the motherfuckin' strip club\n\n[Hook:]\n\nInhale, inhale\nBlow it out, blow it out\nInhale, inhale\nBlow it out, blow it out\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nWhen my nigga come home, that's on everything I got him\nYou know why? Cause we was like that, and we came from the bottom\nYou know how many bitches I was mad that I took\nCause I couldn't throw up the hood, the police had me shook\nAnd all he wanted was a super head's book\nSo I sent it cause I meant it, now the clothes is for crooks (?)\nAnd ya girl?

Can I breathe? Or will I die with this flag on my sleeve?\nWhat else, what else\nIs it war? Is it pain? Will I survive 'til the end of the game? What else, what else"

It's the cops!\"\nNo is not, (woohoohoohoo)\nIt's just the ambulance, put another clip in and let the hammer dance\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI swear to God, these niggas runnin' so fuckin' fast that\nOne nigga tripped so I shot him in the ass\n\"Why you make me do that?\"\nI'm usually a cool cat, like Kool Herc, Kool G, or any other cool nigga that rap\nBut I ain't come to talk, I came for revenge; to avenge the death for my hip-hop friends\nI know, I know you never meant to get 'em killed, never meant to drive the car\nThey never handed you the steel\nApologize now. I know when you see him you will\nBut I got one question:\n\"Nigga how does it feel that they're going now, and you're going now?\"\nPut it to his dome, (BLAAAOW!) He is going home now, bye\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nMy Air Force Ones are comfortable, but they not built to last\nEspecially when you chasin' motherfuckers up and down the ave\nNiggas hit a couple fences, ran through some backyards\nAnd I am not Reggie Bush, I'm heading back to my car\nAs I walked around the corner, I was like\n\"Damn! Los Angeles PD's behind my Lam - Bo.\"\nRunnin' my plates, before I can hit the gate\nI can hear the cops yelling out, \"Wait!\"\nSo I turn around, approach my shit\nHe said: \"Aren't you the guy that used to sing with 50 Cent?\"\n\"Why, yes I am.\"\nThat was my reply\n\"My daughter loves your songs, good day.\"\n\"Good bye!\"\n\n[Hook]"

Yeah when you born worthless\nCatch the bus to Beverly Hills and snatch purses\nPreachers call us serpents, when they worship, so it\u2019s us against them\nLet the steam hit the skin when that pot working\nFrom random tears to chandeliers\nPouring 40s for my peers, but my enemies\n\n[Hook]\nI\u2019ll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in\nWalking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in\nShooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them\nEmpty out the clip then I\u2019m hopping on that 110\nFreeway, that i10 freeway\nTo that 405 freeway, and that 101 freeway\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I\u2019m on that 105 freeway\nHeaded to that 710 freeway\nChickens on the move, nigga it\u2019s a relay\nI got them unmarked bills in that briefcase with that new face in that blue tape\nThrowing Wingstop up out my window\nYou don\u2019t like my flow, I guess it\u2019s time to switch the tempo\nI can pull a model bitch inside a Pinto, fresh as Mentos\nWhere you get them Js? Jordan sent those\nGot my Glock cocked \u2018case a nigga think he fit those\nGet his shit blowed, like it\u2019s endo, over them custom kicks though\nHeart been cold, hot chain been froze, but it\u2019s plated in gold\nRide around in those\nRed Octobers in July, you got 'em, you lie, in red puddles\nPeyton Manning with the cannon, nigga no huddle\nNo rebuttal, when you the king of the square, it\u2019s no trouble\nWhen the city love you\nBut them haters nigga\n\n[Hook]\nI\u2019ll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in\nWalking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in\nShooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them\nEmpty out the clip then I\u2019m hopping on that 110\nFreeway, that i10 freeway\nTo that 405 freeway, and that 101 freeway"

I'm in the Phantom, nah nigga I ain't scared of no ghost\n'Cause all the dead rapper's albums are sellin' the most\n\n[Hook: Sam Hook]\nIn this heartless world that I live in\nI have learned that I can't depend on love\nIt hasn't made me a cent\nSo I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard\n(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nSome say the third verse puts niggas in the hearse\nSince I was born Jay, guess I'm The Gift & The Curse\nLot of Bloods out here, but nigga I did it first\nSpill blood out here that's why I'm up in the church\nStill repenting for my sins, but not all the way\nCause I just rode up in the Benz and handed homie the K\nWhat he 'gon do with it? Prolly 'gon run up on your crew with it\nThat's what I call rap beef, lucky I'm through with it\nNow I just lean back, '72 with it\nSell it to a nigga down south, he act a fool with it\nBack to them haters and them stool pigeons\nYou too busy tryna judge us stars, but how are you livin'?\n\n[Hook: Sam Hook]\nIn this heartless world that I live in\nI have learned that I can't depend on love\nIt hasn't made me a cent\nSo I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard\n(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard"

But why think about it?\nWhy just knock it off your rocker, fuckin' drink and shout at\nWhat's wrong with the world so you can learn some shit you think is outlet\nSlit your wrist to it, listen to Chris' music\nKeep pumpin' your fuckin' fist to this bullshit\nPiss on the flag that has nurtured you\nOffend your rights, persecute, do some dumb shit\nLoose on the run from the fuckin' law that shoot your guns at\nCause you're the fuckin' gangster you claim to be aren't you?\nToo fuckin' dangerous and harmful for just one statement or lawsuit\nThis money and label's painted across you\nBut that's not gonna make us remorseful"

(it's 50 Cent)\nMom, there's ghosts under my bed!\n(G-Unit, G-Unit, G-Unit, G-Unit, G-Unit, G-Unit, G-Unit...)\nAw, shit never mind, it's just the Ghost Unit\nFuckin' faggots\n\n[Hook: Kid]\nThere's somethin' strange in your neighborhood\nWho you gonna call? Ghost Unit\n50, Buck and Banks in your neighborhood\nWhat are they called? Ghost Unit\n\n[Verse: Game]\nIt's time to put a end to the bullshit\nWanna scrap with young homie? Jump in the bull pit\nFake ass wanksta, you ain't no crook and\nI got G-Unot all over Queens and Brooklyn\nCompton and Watts, ATL and Chi-town\nAfter 300 Bars your whole crew locked down\nAnd all you gon' do is sing about me\nCause you can't do a motherfuckin' thing about me\n\n[Bridge: Kid (G-Unit Members)]\n(It's 50 Cent) I ain't afraid of no ghost\n(Young Buck!) I ain't afraid of no ghost\n(Lloyd Banks) I ain't afraid of no ghost\n(Talk of New York, Tony Yayo) I ain't afraid of no ghost\n\n[Interlude: Kid]\nIf you guys are still under there I got the Documentary on my iPod, bitches\nOnly little wiggers listen to that Massacre shit\nMan, no ones scared of you guys, just shut the fuck up\nWhat the fuck is Yayo doing with his hands and shit\nThe motherfucker looks like Castro fabulous\nFake ass Flavor Flav and shit\n\n[Hook: Kid]\nThere's somethin' strange in your neighborhood\nWho you gonna call? Ghost Unit\n50, Buck and Banks in your neighborhood\nWhat are they called? Ghost Unit\n\n[Interlude: Kid]\nMan, I won this fuckin' G-Unot contest (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nAnd I got to bring Olivia to my school for show-and-tell (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nAnd the bitch whipped out her fuckin' dick, man (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nThat was the hottest fuckin' shit in school history, man (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nNow I got all these bitches on my dick and shit (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nEven black chicks man, they love me (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nAnd Game told me, I'm the only white kid in the world (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nThat can call you a punk ass nigga! (Game: I approve that) (I ain't afraid of no ghost)\nBIATCH\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\n50's punk ass ain't never in the streets\nSo he poked his chest out and signed Mobb Deep\nNigga, you a bitch, when it's time for beef\nAll he gon' do is hide behind M.O.P\nAnd I can respect that, they just gettin' they cheese\nThey thugs, but what about M-A-dollar sign-E\nEven worse what the fuck you gon' do about me\nPush Yayo back to Christmas Eve"

   "lyrics": "[The Game]\nStraight outta Compton, Chuck Taylor in Brooklyn 8 deep\nAnd the Desert Storm blew in Ghetto F-A-B\nThe only difference between us\nIs the coast and the length of the ninas\nAnd the rainbow paint on the beamers\nOut here they call me \"All Star Game\"\nAnd every nigga with a gun is waiting on the '04 All Star Game\nSo while you in the Staples parking lot\nI'm watchin the corners, with the safety on like Ronnie Lott\n\n[Fabolous]\nStraight outta Brooklyn it's the same youngan\nSlangin that same onion\nSmokin that Cali bud that my nigga Game brung in\nI keep a dame tongue on my dick\nThe chain huggin my dick\nThe cane brung by the brick, it's ghetto!\nThe fiends sprung on me quick\nBut I still got 20s of dope that'll have yo brain strung on a fix\nThese haters can't stop the rock I pushes\nCause a nigga move around with more arms than them octipusses, nigga\n\n[The Game]\nI got a winchester that will turn your vest into confeddi\nI'm Chuck Taylor, the same nigga that put the 6-4 in Chevy\nIt's the same nigga that keep the .44 in the Chevy\nWith no stash spot, when you in Compton ask coppers\nIf that Aston Martin's the same color as grass hoppers\nI'm runnin the rock, not J, Dame Dash of Hoffa\nSo when you in Compton, you know who to ask for\nThat 21 year old young gun with bricks in the Jaguar, nigga\n\n[Fabolous]\nThe kid push Bentley exaust thru\nAnd if you see my guns you would think Bush sent me to war too\nEven with chicks beggin me for dick regularly\nA nigga known for gettin rid of weight like Dick Gregory\nI'm New York City's fly guy, you bums don't impress me\nI already got the lead waitin for someone to test me\nYou don't wanna be in the news\nCause when I'm lookin for you\nNot even Bin Laden wanna be in your shoes, nigga\n\n[The Game]\nEvery ghetto in America, I know that niggas lettin clips fly\nSo I keep that in mind when I'm out in the N-Y\nNiggas see the Aftermath chain they like F 50\nCause we flyin; through Queens in that Ferarri F-50\nBitches see me in the video, wanna have sex with me\nSo keep a box of Magnums and a bag of X with me\nKeep a .38 Magnum stashed in the vette with me\nAnd it's 'fuck yo life' if you ain't signin check with me\n\n[Fabolous]\nNigga I'm eatin, and you be snackin like you on a diet\nThat's why you window shoppin actin like you wanna buy it\nActin like you gonna roit, like you gonna shoot\nWhen in fact you gone be quiet, like you on mute\nThat's proof, you a punk, and you lucky\nThere ain't enough room to fit a nigga in my roof or the trunk\nI got a box to quickly hide the gun\nYou shouldn't move if you seen Boyz N The Hood\nAnd when Ricky tried to run\n\n[The Game]\nNiggas know when them hollows airin'\nI'll turn your Antoine Walker into a throwback Robert Parish\nWith 2 holes under the Celtic\nAnd you will think your 'Boston Warm-Up' jacket hot\nTill the desert eagle melt it\nI'm a gangsta, and the birds, they love it\n20 with a baby face, and sit on base like Kirby Puckett\nIf you can't afford the new Bentley, fuck it\nCop yay from Jay, the bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage\n\n[Fabolous]\nIn my hood the slower you move, the quicker they get you\nSometimes it's somebody in your click that be with you\nThat's why my vest is thicker to get thru\nAnd I keep 2 nines on my shirt like Dickersons shit do\nWhy waste my breath when I'm bickering with you\nI'd rather waste my techs till they flicker and hit you\nYou sick cause my shit blew\nAnd you ain't goin' nowhere for a while\nA commercial where Snickers will fit you, fucka!\n\n[The Game]\nAin't nothin but a gangsta party when I'm spittin to Pac\nThe paint fall off your Miskeen when I'm spittin the Glock\nBefore I was 16, I was liftin the drop\nSpittin on cops, pitchin the rock\nLike Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks\nNow you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab\nOn a New York bench, while you old niggas in rehab\nAnd if I can't be a hip-hop legend, I'll just die in a ski-mask\n\n[Fabolous]\nWhen a gangsta like me ride\nIt be suede in it, be shades in it\nTires that got the rims that Spree made in it\n1 of the prettiest hoes be laid in it\nBlowin the kid faster than pre-paid minutes\nAnd I'm guessin these haters\nDon't know I keep Wesson & 8ters\nFully loaded with the vest penetrators\nBut if they want it, ya'll can get it\nYa'll love the way the coast to coast G's did it, nigga!"

Everybody, let's ride\nIf I could fit the whole hood in the club\nHop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back\nI turn into a strip club\nCall it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass\nIf I could fit the whole world in the club\nTell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch\nPop bottles and twist up\nRoll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath\nSomebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at?\nYou fuckin' on the first night? Meet me in the back\nI got a pound of chronic and a gang of freaks\nMove bitch, who the fuck you think they came to see?\nThe prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 of the D R E\nTake a picture with him and you gotta fuck me\nAnd you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve\nGot somethin' on my waist, say 'You can't touch Eve'\nThat's my gangsta bitch and like Crips and Bloods\nI'm in the club on some gangsta shit\nSo nigga, twist up, light another dub\nBitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club\n'Ain't Nuthin' But A G Thang', baby, it's a G thang\nBounce like you got hydraulics in your G-string\nI fuck a different bitch seven days a week\nHit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat\nIf I could fit the whole hood in the club\nHop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back\nI turn into a strip club\nCall it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass\nIf I could fit the whole world in the club\nTell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch\nPop bottles and twist up\nRoll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath\nNiggas thought I wasn't comin' back, look at me now\nHoppin' out the same cherry 6 4 with the motherfuckin' top down\nI'm The Game, nigga, call your bitch\nShe ain't home, she with Game, nigga\nRemember that, Dre? You passed me the torch\nI lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray\nRidin' three-wheel motion 'til the ass scrapes\nTurn Sunset into a motherfuckin' drag race\nNow watch it bounce, hit the switch\nLet it bounce 'til the police shut the shit down\nWhen you hit the club, tell 'em you came with me\nWe gon' twist up in the V.I.P\nIt's a new day and if you ever knew Dre\nMotherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre\nSame Impala, different spokes\nSame chronic, just a different smoke\nIf I could fit the whole hood in the club\nHop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back\nI turn into a strip club\nCall it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass\nIf I could fit the whole world in the club\nTell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch\nPop bottles and twist up\nRoll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath"

So I dashed behind the Honda\nAnd look who's here, my baby momma's friend Rhonda\nIn the car kissin' on this dope dealer Chris, but\nLittle did he know he was suckin' my dick\nI start bangin' on the window \"I don't mean to disturb\"\n\"But Chris can you drop me off downtown on 3rd?\"\nHe said \"why sure, what up, Game, hope in\"\nHe was bangin Slick Rick then I got an idea\nBefore we get to 3rd drop me off right here\nSo I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear\nAs I walked in the store they could see I was in a rush\nSo they bout me some jeans, a t-shirt and some fresh chucks\n\nWalked out the store looked left, \"oh no!\"\nRan back in the store, here comes the 5-0\nSo I ran real quick, made a move to the back\nCold knocked this cute bitch into a polo rack\n\"Sorry\", jumped over her and fled to the back door\nThen I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw\nIts the nigga Chris in hand cuffs pointin' at me\nAnd the cops made chase before they let Chris free\nOne cop tried to grab me and the other one missed\nI got away one more time and they both got pissed\n\nFull speed out the mall, spotted this blue coupe\nDogg Pound on the plates, that gotta be Snoop\nSo I ran up to the car and I said, \"Yo Snoop\nThe cops got me on the run\" \"Need a ride nephew?\"\n\"Hell yeah big Snoop\" \"Lil homie hop in\"\n\"Drop me off in Compton\" and that's where my story ends\n\nNow this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh\nJust another story about the wrong path\nHad a long day so I reclined my seat\nIt was a 20 min ride to the CPT\nWalked straight into the house, pulled out my key\nOpened up the door, it's my girl playing Biz Markie\n\nOh you, you got what I neeeeeeeeeed"

   "lyrics": "[The Game]\nI'm from Compton where them guns bust, watch Poppa George pop\nCats tellin jokes at them car games\nSeen big face hundreds, handle the rock like Nate Archibald\nWhat?  This nigga only sixteen\nAnd I wanted to be, just like him, middle school fightin\nAny nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?\nYou want beef with me?  Now I let the heat speak for me\nNo more talkin, just outline chalkin\nNigga Witta Attitude from birth, \"100 Miles and Running\"\nGunnin bustin shots like fuck the cops\nNotorious for burnin blocks, weavin in and out of traffic and chop\nGame the young Robin Hood of the block\nSteal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggas rock\nSecond comin of this black Alfred Hitchcock\nKick in the door, wavin the four-four\nTen shots to your spleen, let them violins sing\n\n[Hook: Blue Chip] + (The Game)\nYo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game, young'uns runnin with 'caine\nRain hits so we floodin the game\nWhen you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man\n(And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn)\nHey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice\nFuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure\n(Dead presidents is all I represent)\n('Til y'all met me y'all niggas ain't met gangsta yet)\n\n[The Game]\nFast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's\nGangbangin, dope traffic, shit get crazy\nFrom where niggas grow up hard like dicks raised\nThem hustlin guns like Knicks players, we got mouths to feed\n'Til they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek\nIn that pine box, I'm buyin rocks, eyein cops\nFuck a cell block, the young kid makin it happen\nWho you think got them fiends runnin back like Bo Jackson?\nI'm a gangsta, what else could I say?\nI'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K\n2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A\nTaught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play\nKeep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em\nNiggas in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album\nBut the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G\nBet the four slow 'em down like PCP\n\n[Hook]\n\n[The Game]\nReal gangsters never talk shit, handle they business\nFuck the dry snitchin and bitchin, niggas die when them bullets fly\nWho fuckin with him, ha?  Not a nigga alive\nEnd up dead in that 5\nHe got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe\nWatch that chest cave in, what that vest savin?\nMake it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy\nOn the frontlines holdin a 9\nEveryday a new chapter, my own niggas plottin on me\nTryin to hit me but they won't get me, feel the semi first\nFuckin with my dough, is the worst way to go\nY'all know, niggas cry when them bullets burn slow dummy\nIn and out of spots watchin my money\nIf one dollar come up missin bodies start to come up missin\nNo one too heavy for the Expedition, piss on your corpse\nWatch your soul shiver, throw him in the river, bitch nigga\n\n[Hook]"

Yeah!\nGame, spit that shit\n\n[The Game]\nHey yo the kid still at it, woke up from that coma\nSeen hell came back and here comes my first classic\nStill chop it up at the table, still put dope in the bag\nAnd still got dope, under the mattress\nIt was hustle before rappin, nuttin before that and\n12 years old, a lost soul, bumpin \"Illmatic\"\nGunshots tried and almost took the young kid's live\nCan't do it I been through it the young kid survived\nGot the ghetto on my shoulder homie, it's gon' be a long ride\nBear with me, I'mma take you there with me\nShow you how the sun shine in one rhyme, no more stormy weather\nStreets is mine, we gon' live forever\nGet it together 'Pac is watchin, Big is listenin\nEazy is talkin to us, Big Pun is witnessin\nWhile they souls still glistenin in ghettos from Compton to Brooklyn\nThe shells cry, every hood's anthem\nWhere everybody goes to church and prayers are never answered\nAnd they throwin' us curveballs but we Hank Aarons\nA picture with no canvas, streets are so skanless\nYoung'uns jump rope, play ball with fiends and dope handlers\nTeenage mothers, deadbeat fathers, no families\nLost and often runaway or live with grandparents\nLife stories with no authors, see it through, {?} Robinson's cubicles\nWhen time life is so beautiful\nWalk with me we can make it if we try, lost soldiers sometimes\nWe gotta die but it's okay to cry\nMothers strugglin tryin to survive, reach out grab my hand\nI got'cha, won't let you go for nuttin, I promise\nPraises due to Elijah Muhammad, peace be unto Farad Muhammad\nWords of Minister Farrakhan\nBeen true, be loyal, know your roots, water your soil\nStop fightin amongst ourself from birth we royal\nWho's king we fightin over a crown, while lifeguards\nWatch the hopes and dreams of kids and young teens drown\nMore infants bein born with AIDS, more parents mournin graves\nThe plot thickens, somebody show us the way\nTears crackin the pavement, streets breakin up\nThe thrill is gone and it's a long walk home\nSo we might as well start runnin, if it's there gotta take it\n'Member Jada said \"We Gon' Make It\"\nAnd it shouldn't take 9/11 to bring our minds together\nShit rough we'll grind together\nLight a candle we can shine forever or I can pass\nSo I won't miss Aaliyah's concert in heaven\nLive life while we listen to my old heads\nSo I glow like the memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez\nThrough a six-seven Brougham, ride with me through the hood mayne\nWhere street lights flicker and Chuck Taylors hang\nAnd nobody know they neighbor's name 'less they sell weed or cocaine\nA lot of black clouds on a block but no rain\nAnd Game got a lot to say, so they wanna take me down\nIn my own front yard like Marvin Gaye\nCan't do it by myself, people need help\nKeep on tryin to live healthy 'til the end of my days\nAnd when I die won't lead my daughter astray, lookin from heaven\nWatch my people drive my coffin through the Compton parade\n\n[Verse Two]\nI'm in the city where it's strange where killers follow direction\nAnd trail witness protection to get a shot at they brain\nWhere the babies carry semis and swallow pills for power\nCount paper for polly'n, penny-pinch for hours\nTake sacks from cowards when the streets is watchin\nTuck guns in trunks cause real G's is boxin\nAin't no other options if you stand on your own two\nAnd if you came to battle you can stand in the phone booth\nCause we don't wear capes in this part of the land\nCause every youngster from my block has been a part of the plan\nI've been trainin since eighty-seven and famous since eighty-nine\nTeaching came from the Nation, my spirit is from divine\nWhen I, pass the word through these raps on beats\nIt's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak\nTo the streets, when I pass these beats\nIt's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak\nTo the streets, y'knahmtalkinbout people?\nMake the track speak, \"Truth Rap,\" get it right\n\"Truth Rap\" mayne, for the people, get it right, \"Truth Rap\""

Nigga, MIA!\n\n[Verse 1]\nSwear a nigga stuntin', but I do this everyday\nHad them hoes bouncin' on my dick like a Chevrolet\nPut on for my city, nigga city on my face\nAnd I'm 'bout to throw a party, tell Diddy send a case\nFuck a square nigga, I'll say it to his face\nRap niggas quick to tell like it's a snitch nigga race\nMy nigga Frank told me, \"take your time bakin' cakes\"\nGotta get to the money at a Indiana pace\nNigga said he gob' rob me, bitch you could miss me\nStay strapped up like I'm 5150\nMo' K's than the mothafuckin' pitcher\nGet your ass smoked like a Swisher\n\n[Hook]\nI keep three heats on me\n.45, Glock and a gauge\nLeBron James, Chris Bosh and D. Wade\nAny nigga try to stunt get sprayed\nWhat happened to the body? Nigga, MIA!\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the mirror, \"where you headed nigga?\" To the fuckin' gun range\nFuck the paper, nigga shoot the whole fuckin' gun range\nYellin' at the cop car \"soo-woo\", here I come Wayne\nBail only a hundred thousand, nigga that's chump change\nBack on deuces, front's on dubs\nBet a Bentley and a Phantom that this bitch don't run\nWhen you worth twenty mill, you can shine when it's sunny\nJust turned thirty, so I can't be from Young Money\nThere's Young Money and there's young money\nNiggas from the crew then there's nigga with young money\nHatin' on a real nigga cause he on and you not\nCut your head, got some tats, now he think he 2Pac\nNigga pull up at the club tryin' to floss\nBoy done grew a beard now he think he Rick Ross\nSay he sellin' birds can't tell you what it costs\nHow the fuck you gon' get a chicken off\n\n[Hook]\nI keep three heats on me\n.45, Glock and a gauge\nLeBron James, Chris Bosh and D. Wade\nAny nigga try to stunt get sprayed\nWhat happened to the body?

Rap\nWent from hustlin sacks to heavy weight, shufflin crack\nKids and preachers know me, young Game the O.G\nAsk the reverand kept the church from fallin, young'uns from starvin\nI'm the project like Marcy or the Nickerson Gardens\nComfortable dawg, Compton to Harlem, any city ghetto or hood\nKick back, blowin, listen to Marvin\nGet head, count dough and just sit in the apartment\nAK in the sofa, I'm the illest, who come closer\nTo the late ones or great ones fightin over a crown\nGet shot off that throne, who the illest now, huh?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Sean T]\nSome say the gangster mentality is dead, imagine that\nWhen fools pullin straps out with infrared\nWe're livin in a time of plagues and corrupt life\nWhen homies in the circle end up all trife\nTryin to shine bright, but lookin all dim\nMeanwhile I stay sharp like a ballpoint pen\nI see the smirks and grins but I just laugh\nCause I'm gettin lucrative loot, endless math\nIf you only knew the half of it, you wouldn't hate\nBut niggas just pig and talk shit behind Jake\nMan you cain't knock the hustle, I ain't fin' to be greedy\nI want an exit out the game kinda like Paul Vitti\nI'm tryin to slang CD's in cruise control\nInstead of sellin illegal pharmaceuticals\nShould I ask for your advice?  Like you would know\nFuck it, I'm out to get it, I'm a fool for dough\n\n[Hook]"

Bet the S-5 pink on it\n\n[Hook]"

Hooked up with Get Low Records\nPuttin this shit together, my nigga\n\n[Verse 1: JT]\nIt ain't a nigga in the game that could hold me down\nI've been independent forever so they know me now\nAnd I'm the cat they gotta find when they wanna get signed\nYou wanna get your paper right you gotta study my grind\nI'm like Rush in \"Krush Groove,\" a nigga that bust moves\nRight out, and tuck tools, bullets that bust dudes\nAin't no beef in the briefcase, just beef for Pete's sake\nWe round up cats, to beat 'em in a street race\nWe count paper up, to make a nigga change his plans\nThey under weight so they ain't gettin off they gram\nYou mad at my boys, cause we choppin 'em in\nThey make twenty then the Fig want 10\nThat's the rules that the Get Low, play by\nThe block boys stay high, California stock with K-5\nIt's the rules that the Get Low play by\nThem block boys stay high, the California K-5\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nHuh, it's the Blacksox doin a joint together\nThe whole world stoppin to listen, ol' breakers poplockin to this\nAnd white boys headboppin in 6's, niggas boxin in prison\nShit bang hard like a conjugal visit\nAnd the game ain't big enough for niggas so move over\nMatter fact, move out, we takin over\nThem boys is comin, and they aimin straight for the neck\nThe B-L-A, C-K, S-O-X\n\n[Verse 2: Bluechip]\nYo, yo, well it's the B dot L dot, you know the rest\nWanted by the feds, hated by the ATF\nYou can catch me at the DuPont Inn, two dykes swallowin gin\nShorty sucked me out of my Timbs\nMy bad, that's your wife?  Fuck your life\nAnyway, I heard you workin for vice\nYou ain't real man you hide behind ice\nYouse a impostor, snatch him off the roster\nAlways live by the rule, get dough, or die trying\nHardcoded into shinin\nPass the bucket now I'm back on bet it\nIf, beef was erased man my tool gon' finish\nNever been the loudmouth type\nSugar Shane of this rap shit, southpaw when the mac spit\nListen rookie, don't make me mad boy\nOr you gon' be like Big, a dead Bad Boy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nHuh, niggas think they got the game sewed, yeah right\nI'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes\nIf the Navi outside, I might be there\nBlack hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs\nRock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare\nYou see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear\nAnd when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head\nAnd if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead\nThen I'm goin goin, back back\nTo the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop\nNiggas know I'm good with the Glock, they call me Chick Hearns\nCause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots\nI'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX\nThen get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box\nAnd when I die, bury me with the Glock, and a bucket of shells\nIn case niggas want drama in hell\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Game]\nStraight outta Compton, Chuck Taylor in Brooklyn, 8 deep\nAnd the Desert Storm blew in Ghetto F-A-B\nThe only difference between us is the coast and the lift of the ninas\nAnd the rainbow paint on the Beamer\nOut here they call me All Star Game\nAnd every nigga with a gun waitin for the oak floor all star game\nSo while you in the Staples parking lot\nI'm watchin' the corner with the safety on like Ronnie Lott\n\n[Fabolous]\nStraight outta Brooklyn, it's the same youngin, slingin' the same onions\nSmokin' that Cali bud that my nigga Game brung in\nI keep a dame tongin' my dick, a chain hung to my dick\nThe Caine run by the brick, it's ghetto\nThe fame sprung on me quick\nBut I still got 20s of dope that'll have your brain strung on a fix\nThese haters can't stop the rock I pushes\nCause a nigga move around with more arms than an octopus's\nNigga\n\n[Game]\nI got a Winchester that'll turn your vest into confetti\nI'm Chuck Taylor the same nigga that put the '64 in Chevy\nIt's the same nigga to keep the .44 in the Chevy\nWith no stash spot, when you in Compton ask coppers\nIf that Aston Martin the same color as grasshoppers\nI'm runnin' the rock, not Jay, Dame Dash or Hoffa\nSo when you in Compton you know who to ask for\nThat twenty-year-old young gun with bricks in the Jaguar\nNigga\n\n[Fabolous]\nJay push Bentley ISR's through\nAnd if you seen my guns you'd think Bush sent me to war too\nEven with chicks beggin' me for dick regularly\nA nigga known for gettin' rid of weight like Dick Gregory\nI'm New York City's fly guy, you bums don't impress me\nI already got the lead, waitin' for someone to test me\nAnd you don't wanna be in the news\nCause when we lookin' for you, not even Bin Laden would wanna be in your shoes, nigga\n\n[Game]\nEvery ghetto in America I know that niggas lettin' clips fly\nSo I keep that in mind when I'm out in the NY\nNiggas see the Aftermath chain they like \"F 50\"\nCause we flyin' through Queens in that Ferarri F-50\nBitches see me in the video, wanna have sex with me\nSo I keep a box of Magnums and a bag of X with me\nKeep a .38 Magnum stashed in the Vette with me\nAnd it's \"fuck your life!\" if you ain't signin' checks with me\n\n[Fabolous]\nNigga I'm eatin' and you be snackin' like you on a diet\nThat's why you window shoppin' actin' like you wanna buy it\nActin' like you want a riot, like you gon' shoot\nWhen I'm back you gon' be quiet\nLike you on mute\nThat's proof you a punk\nAnd you're lucky there ain't enough room to fit a nigga in my roof and the trunk\nThey got a box to quickly hide the gun\nYou shouldn't move, if you seen Boyz N the Hood and knew Ricky tried to run\n\n[Game]\nNiggas know when them hollows airin'\nI'll turn your Antoine Walker to a throwback Robert Parish\nWith two holes under the Celtic\nAnd you would think your Boston warm up jacket hot till the Desert Eagle melt it\nI'm a gangsta and the birds they love it\nTwenty with a baby face and sit on base like Kirby Puckett\nYou can't afford the new Bentley? Fuck it\nCop yay from Jay, the bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage\n\n[Fabolous]\nIn my 'hood the slower you move the quicker they get you\nSometimes it's somebody in the click that be with you\nThat's why my vest is thicker to get through\nAnd I keep two nine's on my shirt like Dickerson's shit do\nI waste my breath when I'm bickering with you\nI'd rather waste my techs till they flicker and hit you\nYou sick as my shit blue\nAnd you ain't goin' nowhere for a while, a commercial where Snickers'll fit you, fucker\n\n[Game]\nAin't nothin' but a gangsta party when I'm spittin' to Pac\nThe paint fall off your Miss King when I'm spittin' the Glock\nBefore I was sixteen I was liftin' a drop\nSpittin' on cops, pitchin' the rock\nLike Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks\nNow you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab on a New York bitch\nWhile you old niggas in rehab\nAnd if I can't be a hip hop legend I'll just die in a ski mask\n\n[Fabolous]\nWhen a gangsta like me ride it be suede in it, be shade tinted\nTires got the rims that Spree made in it\nOne of the prettiest hoes be laid in it\nBlowin' the kid faster than prepaid minutes\nI'm guessin' these haters don't know I keep the Wes in the ators\nFully loaded with the vest penetrators\nBut if they want it, y'all can get it\nYou love the way the coaster coast chiefs did it"
