  "plain": "Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn (b. November 20, 1983), popularly known as Future, is an American rapper and singer from Kirkwood, Atlanta, Georgia. He is signed to Epic Records. He is the cousin of Rocko and Rico Wade and a former associate of the Dungeon Family. He first rapped under the stage name Meathead.\n\nFuture has made himself known for his extensive use of auto-tune, producing a flurry of hit singles such as \u201cFuck Up Some Commas\u201d and \u201cTurn On The Lights\u201d, among others.\n\nFuture is also known for his hook singing on tracks such as \u201cBuy The World\u201d, \u201cU.O.E.N.O, \u201cLoveeeeee Song\u201d & \u201cPain\u201d.\n\nFuture was at one point engaged to singer Ciara and they have a child, Future Jr., but they broke up\u2014due to Future apparently not wanting a very extravagant wedding. He later went on to say:\n\nI can\u2019t have no big wedding on E! News. \u2026 I can\u2019t have all these different big media outlets cover my wedding and I\u2019m not comfortable. \u2026 I\u2019m not comfortable about where I\u2019m at in my career. I\u2019m not comfortable about compromising about just being the person that I am, being the man that I am. I feel like my better judgment is to go back and record and make music.\n\nHe is closely associated to Atlanta producers DJ Esco, Southside, Metro Boomin, Sonny Digital & Zaytoven.\n\nHe\u2019s the first artist in history to have back-to-back number one album debuts after releasing FUTURE and HNDRXX a week apart from each other in 2017."

You made me pull this gun out\n\n[Verse 1: Future]\nWhere your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?\nWhere your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out\n\n[Verse 2: Future]\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?\nWhere your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects\nWhere your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts\nHad her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping\nRunning through the pussy like a nigga going jogging\nFuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket\nPut a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping\nWhere your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?\nHad to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope\nJackie Chan moves got game in the choke\nGas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco\n12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope\nBurglar bar doors got a young nigga confident\nJuugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest\nBlowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nMan, where your ass was at when we took the city over?\nWhere your ass was at when all they'd ask was \"what's the hold up?\"\nWhere your ass was at when niggas first got the news?\nNow your ass around because we're paying back dues\nWhere were you when all the dogs needed help?\nLawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself\nWhere your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?\nWhere your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom\nMan I ain't got no choice\n'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy\nI'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed\nI'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise\nMan, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?\nWhere your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest\nFuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nWhere your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?\nWhere your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?\nWhere your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?\nWhere your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out\n\n[Verse 4: Future]\n60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic\nHad them bitches fall through fucking like a savage\nHeard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket\nHeard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet\nHeard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet\nServe a lot of dog food, call you a mutt\nWhere your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?\nThe reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?\nWhere your ass was at, dog?

me?\n(8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)\n\n[Refrain]\nPour that bubbly\nDrink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it\nYeah, I'm covered in it\nI was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit\nThat's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches\nThat ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas\nThat ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch\nI'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy\nThat's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely\nI'm drinking bubbly\nI'm drinking bubbly (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 1]\nTake all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah\nAudemar, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier\nDom Perignon, I get down from a brown, I get chauffeured around\nI pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town\nI corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds\nI grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds\nWe order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around\nI say everything triple time\nRollie, AP, Hublot, triple time\nI just know the ones you call upon\nI just had to pay my dawg a bond\nLooking at me like a triple threat\nEvery time a nigga talk, a check\nSmoke the kush up like a cigarette\nRun it back, you hear my intellect (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)\n\n[Bridge]\nCelebrating like the championship\nCelebrating like the championship\nCelebrate like the championship\nCelebrate like the championship\nI told you, I told you, I told you, I told you\nHahah, celebrate\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't tell me you celibate to the mula\nI just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler\nI just went St. Tropez-in' like a goonie\nAbu Dhabi, nigga straight out the sewer\nLike a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it\nI'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors\nI just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'\nTake it back and take a look at yourself\nTake the lesson, put it all in the air\nToo many days gone by\nSittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply\nDrying my eyes, believe it or not\nI could never see a tear fallin'\nWater drippin' on me like a faucet\nI just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle\nSpent another sixty thousand on a Rollie\nAll my diamonds got you brainwashed\nShe sucked my dick, it got my brain washed\nAnd for that shit, you got your man popped\nSee what they did to Biggie and Pac\nPour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' more liquor out\nPour it out, pour it out, pour it out\n\n[Chorus]\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nAll this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy\n\n[Verse 3]\nDrownin' in Actavis, suicide\nWhen I hit the scene, it's homicide\nDiamond pinky ring a lollipop\nFuck the hate, I pull up in a drop\nDiamonds colder than a glacier\nBallin' harder than the Pacers\nI been tryin' to have some patience\nTold my mama she should pray on it\nTold the streets they gotta wait on it\nShe gon' put a nigga name on it\nI just dropped a whole thang on it\nI'm making USD's overseas\nThat's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve\nFucked my white girl, she said, \"Nigga, please\"\nFuck that white girl, she said, \"Nigga, please\"\nPlayin' poker, now we're back in Stroker\nI forgot her name but her pussy soakin'\nWhen I seen her on the pole\nReminded myself when I used to come over\nReminded myself when I used to get loaded\nRemindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded\nThe coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded\nThis whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded\nI try to control it\nLet's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus\nLet's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably\nI fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank\nRockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies\nMarried to this motherfuckin' money\n\n[Chorus]\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nAll this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou thought I forgot about us?\nI know that you know I don't fold under pressure\nI'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal\nWe live by the codes of the ghetto\nI'm closing this out with my memo\nI'm treating this shit like a demo\nI'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more\nI'm in that Dolce Gabbana\nI might get after Madonna\nI get it crack in the summer\nStrapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer\nFronted a pack to my partner\nAll this lingo got her panties to dropping\nFuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving\nAll this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it\nI'm an addict and I can't even hide it\nDon't you panic, panoramic companion\nThey was tryna serve me at the arraignment\nNever comment on it, never complaining\nI'm taking everything that come with these millions\nI'm taking everything that come with my children\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Refrain]\nPour that bubbly\nDrink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it\nYeah, I'm covered in it\nI was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit\nThat's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches\nThat ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas\nThat ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch\nI'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI've been in the stu late, workin', no residuals\nIf we never speak again, I'm just glad I got to tell the truth\nI ain't done countin'\nYou wanna come to paradise?\nMatter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?\nHaha\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe told me she was an angel\nShe fucked two rappers and three singers\nShe got a few athletes on speed dial\nI'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial\nAnd these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child\nNo this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child\nI used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child\nAll these cameras on, fuckin' with my mood, wild\nAnd these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud\nThey know damn well this wasn't promised\nI know damn well this must be karma\nLeft every pair of Margielas at the condo\nTechnically I never packed up and leave\nLeft 80 racks in the dresser, you can keep\nAnd I got this bad ting at disposal\nI cooked it up and then I went global\nMy baby mama push a Range Rover\nHad to make sure I got it fully loaded\nCan't be the one and then you get exposed\nIf you the one, then God will let me know\nBut at the same time, I like to vibe with one\nI'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one\nAnd I had to 'splain to her last night\nHad to send this one freak on the last flight\nHad to send this one freak on the last flight\n\n[Chorus]\nWon't get a response from me, ain't no confessions\nBefore I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'\nAny time I got you, girl you my possession\nEven if I hit you once, you part of my collection\nEven if I hit you once, you part of my collection\nEven if I hit you once, you part of my collection\n\n[Verse 2]\nStandin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock\nIcin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock\nYeah, maybe it's the drop, yeah\nWe get in our feelings, yeah\nI don't know how you would feel about if I ain't have millions, yeah\nI'm conversin' with you, I hope you hear me, yeah\nKeep my promise, take my love with you everywhere\nAnd hell no it ain't about no braggin' rights\nBut even if it was, shit I got it\nPinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti\nShe told me she was an angel\nShe fucked two rappers and three singers\nI'ma keep it genuine and tell the truth to you\nI got this jawn, she know what to do with me\nAnd right now I don't know what to do with you\nI don't wanna sound like I'm bein' rude with you\nShe caught a red eye, leavin' L.A\nI shoulda gave her to the valet\nAnd I had to tell her 'bout Miami\nAfter she came with no panty\n\n[Chorus]\nWon't get a response from me, ain't no confessions\nBefore I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'\nAny time I got you, girl you my possession\nEven if I hit you once, you part of my collection\nEven if I hit you once, you part of my collection\nEven if I hit you once, you part of my collection"

Real talk\nWill-Will-Will-William\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy savages, my savages, my savages\nI'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin\nI grew up in a ruthless ass environment\nI'm on the phone with Yo, I ask him how the trial went\nThirty-five racks is how my day was spent\nI gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get\nYou got me thinking all these bitches artificial\nThe way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga\nRoll some herb up, pour some syrup up\nThey tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us\nI told you way before what happened, they was hating on us\nYou know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us\nAyy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?\nHow we let these bitches get between us?\nHow we let these niggas get between us?\nI got love for all my savages with itchy fingers\nI got love but it ain't like the love I got for India\nShe held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity\nMy lil' dawg caught a murder, gone for infinity\nDumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me\nR.I.P. my granddad Quick, he should have seen this shit\nTwenty thousand on some child support, I seen this shit\nRiding around with all them choppers, I done seen this shit\nThese rappers mad at me, but these niggas ain't doing shit\nAnd I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit\nI went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership\nThe fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships\nIf Esco didn't love me, would've been done jumped ship\nAnd it's the love from my fans got me still here\n\n[Interlude]\nMonster, ah\nSay I'm Illuminati\nThey tryna make me catch a body\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't know when I'ma flip, nigga\nGet me some codeine and sip, nigga\nBig Bank saying wipe a nigga's nose\nMy girl changed the lock on the doors\nSaid fuck that shit, poured up a four\nAin't falling in love with no ho\nThat what you want for me?\nThat what you really expect?\nYou thinking I'm sitting up depressed?\nI'm somewhere countin' up me a check\nI hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret\nDrag the mink on the floor\nPut Cuban links on my ho\nTen whips in a row, who would think we were poor?\nWho would think we was poor?\nThere's money laying on the floor\nGot some hoes laying on some hoes\nGot lil' shawty with me, she a pro\nKnow she'll never meet another nigga, not another nigga like me\nEven if he got a billion dollars, he can't make her cum like me\nWho compliment you like me? It better be about an image\nTell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented\nBecause the Spur wasn't tinted, I told 'em ain't got nothing to hide\nTold 'em I'm through with the pies\nTold 'em fuck all of my wrongs, I don't even write\nMy savages, my savages, my savages\nWe gon' leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin\n\n[Outro]\nFree all my niggas incarcerated, you heard me?\nLoyal for life, you heard?\nFreeband Gang\nWe global now"

How can I not? How can I not?\nHow can I not get this guala and flip all this guala\nBecause a young nigga was starving\nHow can I not make this music for dealers and killers and niggas who out there be robbing\n\n[Verse 1: Future]\nRun in your spot, smashing your ho, fuck on your couch\nQuit running your mouth, pimping my pen beginning to end\nTelling the plot, look at my watch, fuck all your thoughts\nI appreciate you niggas I appreciate you bitches for keeping me relevant talk all you want\nBrag all I want, how can I not make you niggas regret\nHow can I not go and get me a check\nHow can you not get hooked on percocet\nHow can you not be the one who was star\nHow can you not be the one who was king\nHow can you not come around and I stare at these niggas and niggas be rocking this bling\nCum bitch then cum again, how can I not want to fuck your friend?\nProper game make em all wonder how it feel being with a pimp\nEveryday something different money cars clothes different\nMe and money got a chemistry, me and you a big difference\n\n[Hook: Future]\nHow can I not make a movie\nHow can I not do this shit that these niggas don't love\nHow can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup\nHow can I not take my style back from niggas\nWhen niggas was taking my style way before\nHow can I not?

Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Future!\n\nUm, that Drunk in Love song, was that your song that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z did?\n\nCause I'm honest, I didn't, when you, they put you on the MTV -uh, what was it-, the top 10 best rappers, I don't know what the number was, I was like 'why is Future on that list?'\n\nIs that, is that, I might've mistaken, I might've read it wrong. I might've seen a one before the five. Is that a fifteen-carat diamond ring?\n\n[Tons of news reports layered]"

Fish and Grits!\nTake a pic Snap a flick kiss my kicks they pay attention\nMust they finally realize you in the murkin mix\nYou gone pull in line or we gone spit that venom\nI'm thinkin 10 steps ahead I want my own denim\nWe were goin in them stackin every penny\nStretching every nickel over the same strippers\nI gave it to you straight up, right down the center\nWe don't like rappin this car is foreign right down the center\n\n[Hook]\nI'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)\nImma mofukin boss (I can't make this up)\nYou ain't no extraordinary (I can't make this up)\nMe and money got married (I can't make this up!)\nDo it playa do tha shit (I can't make this up)\nI seen u niggas back in '06 (I can't make this up)\nTurn a club into a crib (I can't make this up)\nBought a ticket in a club (I can't make this up!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get this big without tryin\nI'm matchin' by mistake I want that yacht I'm on my grind\nI learn from my mistakes\nYou want it daddy go and get it\nDon't never hesitate\nI'm burnin hotter than some lava and I ain't takin off a day\nThey on my trail, like they tryin' to build a case\nThese rappers worser than them few\nThey watch you spendin' cake\nThey want ya style\nAnd they often imitate\nI set the trend\nAnd I watch them duplicate it\nI'm satisfied with none of this money I'm getting hungry\nI'm breakin' bread with a team young nigga we hit Columbia\nSalute the troops we in them coupes like caprices\nOld school player ridin' in a foreign feature\nChange em up like rentals yeah we change em up like rentals\nRidin' like the president.. I'm presidential\nBlowin' green like ya thought I would\nIt's simple\nI'm coming straight up out my temple\n\n[Hook]\nI'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)\nImma mofukin boss (I can't make this up)\nYou ain't no extraordinary (I can't make this up)\nMe and money got married (I can't make this up!)\nDo it playa do tha shit (I can't make this up)\nI seen u niggas back in '06 (I can't make this up)\nTurn a club into a crib (I can't make this up)\nBought a ticket in a club (I can't make this up!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nDo You take the cash to be yo lawfully wedded wife\nAnd Honor this bih for the rest of yo life\nYes I do till death do us part\n365 yay they go hard\nAnd we go home\nCrib so big look like the Georgia dome\nI'm rollin like a rollin stone, they do nothin\nI pick the streets where I belong\nWhat time were we supposed to be\nMaybe its the dro in me\nMy girl got a girlfriend\nLook like she come from overseas\nAin't nothing like these other niggas\nI took the chicken out the bill with her\nShit I done still in her its still in em\nWho introduced you, to jimmy and tory\nChange the color of the bottom of your shoe ya walkin foreign\nGotcha nigga vip\nThat's very important\nI done freestyled\nMore than you lil niggas recorded\n\n[Hook]\nI'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)\nImma mofukin boss (I can't make this up)\nYou ain't no extraordinary (I can't make this up)\nMe and money got married (I can't make this up!)\nDo it playa do tha shit (I can't make this up)\nI seen u niggas back in '06 (I can't make this up)\nTurn a club into a crib (I can't make this up)\nBought a ticket in a club (I can't make this up!)"

Let get 'em {?} out, YEAH!\nPlatinum, got another one, baby! Let's do it!\n\n[Verse One]\nI'm walkin' this walk, I'm talkin' this talk\nThe boys they got my back up, walkin' wit' a swagga\nSneaks stay fresh, white-tee stay cris-py\nLight crease in my blue jeans, y'all try to stay with me\nNate Butters hook my line up, sharp tape in the sides and the front\nJackie Chan style, I do my own stunts, UH!\nBlack man, watch that, man right thurr\nSo much dough in my back pocket, I gotta front\nI got favor, my back's watched, how bout your front?\nNeighbor relax please, cause trust me this ain't what you want!\nToo many soldiers walk with He, be easy\nThe team gives ghosts the heebie jeebies (brotha please!)\nI ain't scared of nuthin' under the heavens\nI throw wack suckerz, doggy start hoein' and heavin'\nListen, yo' flow is +daffy+, start +duckin'+\nCause my flow is hungry and my bar'll eat your team up, AH!\n\n[Chorus 2X]\nSECULAR RAPPERS, I'm COMING, uh!\nYou hear my footsteps I'm coming..\nAnd I mean this brotha to brotha, man\nI hope you suckerz got your bags packed\nCause if not you're gonna feel my wrath!\n\n[Verse Two]\nMy bible got a lot of +clips+, +baby+ (\"Grind-in'\" *brrrrrrrrrr*) *Birdman call*\nSo relax, boy, before they ask \"What Happened To That Boy?\"\n(Did you catch that one?) Won't hesitate a minute to get at that boy\nI make that sin thing diminish and your flesh could go wit' it, UH!\nFuture's flow quite attractive and dapper\nThe chiropractic rapper, I GETS IT CRACKIN', UH!\nHe's so focused, it's nothing that could distract him\nPut a low jack on his ankle, y'all still couldn't track him\nI'm not braggin', but the flow is proper\nAny bro' close to Future flow probably with Hoffa (uh!)\nMeaning dead somewhere under a field\nI give props to Pac and B.I.G., but, that's about it, UH!\nAnd I'm glad Jay finally retired\nHe got out the game just in time, to miss this fire\nBut the rest of you suckerz get ready\nI'm about to have the whole secular industry, +delirious+ like +Eddie+ (WOO!)\nI'm not heady, I'm just so sure\nThat Jesus writin' and Future flow sick wit' no cure\nChitty chitty bang bang, Future doing his thang-thang\nRappers' movin' they mouth, but ain't saying a DANG THANG\n\n[Chorus 2X]\n\n[Verse Three]\nYou secular Iraqi rappers, it's over for you soldiers\nLike Bush and Sadaam, I push buttons and BOMB\nFlow hits so quick, faster than Islam\nAnd deeper than a Buddhist, I'll show you how to do this!\nMatta of fact, I'll show you how to do it the right way\nThese ain't just bars of stuff I'd like to say\nBut these is bars of stuff you might see\nIf you're even in Vegas (Greenville) or anywhere that I might be\nAnd don't think it's a game!\nI'm twenty-plus years old, I stopped playing around thirteen\nAm I the only one that's seeing the world is hurt-IN'\nAnd willin' to spit with substance, not about slingin' and frontin'\nBars is wack and empty, not rappin' about nothin'\nEmpty barrels making a lot of noise, and listen\nI ain't scared of none of your BOYS\nI got boys too, and we got favor, what chy'all got is na-thin'!\nI'm simply too much for ya!\nYou can't fool with the brotha, if you do he'll bust ya!\nDuck tape your flesh up, doggy, and Bible-butt ya\nYou better chill before it get real and you get touched brah!\n\n[Chorus 6X]"
