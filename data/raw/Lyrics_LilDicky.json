Let me down Tim\nHopped off, lookin' puzzled at the round rim\nSaw a ball up in the corner on the ground then\nRussell started dribbling and giggling astounded\nThen he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it\nAnd when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin' sound friction\nUp in a swish make and he was confounded\nBecause he knew that he had found him\nBut right now; it was still for the fun\nJust a way to kill the time when the farming was done\nThen the walking turned to running, and the hoppin' turned to jumping\nAnd dunking, and Russell had to keep coming\nBecause the young\u2019n was fucking disgusting and loving it\nRunning it, all of a sudden the public started to come in abundance and fuck wit him\n'Cause he was butter and hungry, hung jury\n'Cause stories of glory, not normally for people like him\nThen the word got around up to ESPN\nAnd they flying Russell down to compete in the gym\nBunch a grown men lookin' to belittle the kid\nBecause to those men, ball was the reason to live\nAnd the G.O.A.T.S. they been all in since they was kids\nSo this goat owning mafucka look like a dick\nAnd even know Russell knows that, he doesn\u2019t submit\nHe just chills with a grin\nAnd then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge\nMake it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men\nLookin' better than his predecessors ever could get\nTurned the animosity to respect\nAnd then the Thunder called him\nSaid they heard a lot about the ballin'\nTold him that they wanna get involved and\nShowed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it\u2019s so appalling\nOklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty\nAwesome, errbody laud him\nErry-bitty lookin' like they really fucking fallin'\nCondominium is so legitimate it\u2019s sprawling\nAnd this muthafucka on the court straight ballin'\nCash all up in that ass, lol\u2019ing at the past like\nWhere the fuck would I be at up on the other path, right?\nIf I never stumbled 'pon the game then think of that life\nShit, who taking care of my farm?\nWho taking care of my farm?\nWho taking care of my farm?\nI really loved that farm, uh\n\n[Outro]\nCAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE\nFive-hundred million now that\u2019s a pound cake\nAccording to Jay Z, and Drake\u2026\nBut greatness ain\u2019t about cake"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDrunk, faded\nBrowned out, looking all shady\nTwo months since I fucked a lady\nYoung Man dick going crazy\nStandard Saturday\nI'm about to get a cab and masturbate\nThen I see a hot girl look back at Dave\nLemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway\nThat's what I thought not what I said to her\n'Stead I walk up to her like, \"I know you heard of the kid\nYou heard what I did, you heard of my shit, the murderous spit\"\nShe's like, \"Naw, you're being weird, what are you talking about?\"\nI'm like, \"Aw...\" Pulling out my phone like a boss\nYouTube 'bout to get her off\nBut as I type the y-o-u, some porno pop up\nI'm like, \"Hold up, how did... that's not even me\nLike, I don't jerk off mobily...\"\nThen her friends coming up and wanna know if everything is okay\nI'm like, \"Naw, this a rape, you can't tell?\nGimme a break, please, get the heck away\"\nI turned to her, \"Let me buy you a drink,\" she like, \"Fine\"\nTold the man, \"Two Patr\u00f3n,\" she like, \"Lime\"\nSaid he tried twice, the card got declined\nI'm like, \"Alri\u2014, is this a\u2014\nCould it be a machine issue?\" He was like, \"Naw,\"\nI was like, \"Obviously there's something wrong\nI got dough, like I'm not broke...\nI got doughnuts with the same card like about an hour ago\"\nHe like, \"Dude, I don't know\"\nNow I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go\nAnd I ain't talking 'bout with me, bro, I mean alone\nI got one more chance to prove myself\nSo I'm like\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\n\"Look, I'm athletic, girl, I've gotten several Rec League MVP's\nAt my crib, I've got some pizza, plus a little bit of weed\nIn my room, I've got a TV, plus I recently did sheets\nGirl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door\nLike with the crushed ice\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know I don't give a damn what your plan right now\nThis is me coming at you as a man right now\nLemme freak, lemme freak, Goddammit, lemme freak\nJust lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe girl from the first verse\nSomehow let me fuck\nFast forward, seven months, we in love\nSome real serious relationship type shit\nDespite this, I ain't fucked for days\nTried last night, but was pushed away\nBut I've been acting well behaved today\nI smell okay, Adele Pandora's playing\nNow she laying on the floor\nAnd I'm praying this bitch is horny, I go and give her a smooch\nShe kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs\nBad move, she don't like that\nBad mood, her boss being mean to her\nVia email, she wanna write back\nI'm like, \"Right now?\"\nShe like, \"Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me?\"\n\"Oh, okay, what's the context?\"\nThen she like, \"Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me\"\n\"Who's Jane again?\" I said,  she like, \"Wow, you should know that...\"\n\"Okay, I guess I forgot,\" she like, \"Dude, that's my other boss\"\n\"Okay, true, so shouldn't your first boss\nGo to the other boss, before you? Right?\"\n\"But Jane isn't hands-on!\" she yelled\n\"Okay, well I just don't understand the dynamic then\nI don't work with these people,\" she started crying\n\"Wait, stop, what the fuck is this?\"\n\"Naw, you don't ever take my side\"\nAbout an hour later 'til I'm on her good side\nWe in bed, hands on her good thighs\nI try to kiss, she like, \"Goodnight\" but I'm like\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\n\"Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee\nI've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing and weed\nYesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet\nAnd supportive aunt during the fourth quarter, of the Eagles\nNow reward it\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know I don't give a damn what your plan right now\nThis is me coming at you as a man right now\nLemme freak, lemme freak, Goddammit, lemme freak\nJust lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak\n\n[Verse 3]\nFast forward some more, June 16th, 20-74\nOld LD looking old as fuck, still with the same ho, holding up\nBut my life sucks, legs hurt, friends dead, real terse\nMy dick looking like it's tinfoil\nHer tits looking like they hard-boiled eggs\nOn top of that, she insane\nLike, I don't even think she knows who I am\nOur kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days\nMaybe months, who knows, probably gonna die soon\nPretty scared, I ain't even gonna lie to you\nThink about it all day, on my last legs\nBut I'm going out with a bang\nI got pills they invented back in '57\nI took five, that's a bit excessive\nI look high, take a look at my thighs\nAnd good God that's a little erection, it'll work though\nNow I've gotta find the ho, I'm pretty much blind at this point\nI don't know if I mentioned that yet, but I am\nMade my way into the bedroom and there she is, I'm like\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\n\"Look, I don't know if you're aware that\nYou've been throwing out my shoes\nWhat I do know is, I'm sick of doing nothing here with you\nAll my blood is in my dick, I'm probably dying pretty soon\nAre you even comprehending what I'm saying\nPlease acknowledge that you hear me...\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know I don't give a damn what your plan right now\nThis is me coming at you as a man right now\nLemme freak, lemme freak, Goddammit, lemme freak\nJust lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAyy, what's going on, man?\nIt's your boy, Lil Dicky\nAKA Mr Leftward-Sloping Penis\nI got a story for y'all, man\nPeep this\nYes sir! A'ight, let's go\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow I been dating this girl named Katie, she hot as hell\nAnd her body crazy, vagina shaven and it don't smell\nAnd I don't fall for chickens\nBut this one a little different, body sickening\nPlus, she really good at making breaded chicken\nGot me thinkin she the one, man\nEven fully clothed, shawty really fun man\nGet a lotta hoes, but none of those come close\nI swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposed\nOh yeah there's one more thing\nAnd I know this shit gonna sound insane\nBut I still haven't hit it\nI admit it, I wish I was kidding\nNever been up inside before\nBecause she's only fucked one guy before\nAnd though I really wanna boink this whore\nShe my sweetie 3.14\nSo I'm stayin patient and masturbating\nAnd now my heart is sorta racing\nCause she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating\nHell yeah, I'm down, I'm 'bout to go all out\nI'm gonna pound that crazy, like an elaborate black man handshake\nBut on the way to crib, we pass this kid\nAnd he seem to know who Katie is\nSo I say \"Who this?\" and she say\n\"Dicky, this is my ex-boyfriend Jim!\"\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type\nBut as I'm looking at this dude, I can't believe my eyes\n'Cause he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life\nHe's got the thickest head of hair, chiseled jaw, an egregious bod\nMan, this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian god\nAnd now I'm lookin at my chick, cause his dick's been inside her raw (fuck that!)\nAw, damn\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan this is crazy\nI can't believe this guy used to fuck my lady\nI bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti\nKatie's hugging and squeezing his shoulder blades\nAnd I'm buggin and queasy, this ain't okay\nAnd then they say, \"Let's get drinks\" so I say \"Okay\"\nEven though I was about to get laid!\nMan this muhfucker look like Ashton\nCombined wit a lil Hugh Jackman\nIn other words, he's so damn attractive\nSo damn tan, he gotta have a little black in him\nNow I'm in the back wit him, sippin on some 'gnac wit him\nAnd he payin for it all, he investment banking\nI'm acting like I ain't distracted\nBut I'm reenacting him and Katie bangin'\nAnd now I'm feelin' pissed, so I go and take a piss\nMidstream, I look left and guess who it is\nAnd I had to see, and I was mad discreet\nAnd I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek\n\"Oh my god becky, look at that cock!\"\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type\nBut as I'm lookin at his dick, I can't believe me eyes\nBecause he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life\nAnd now I'm starin at this dude's soft dick with a lot of hate\nBecause the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate\nAnd I don't know if I can date my girl after tonight\nAw, damn\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't know what to do, dude's dick is really huge\nI didn't realize a penis could be so smooth\nI know she's missing that, my penis isn't that\nI'm looking closer, I think that his dick has abs\nSix pack on a dick, now what the fuck is that?\nIt's so long and thick, It's like a punching bag\nI'm saying it's so shaven, head is amazing\nGot my dick looking like a raisin\nSkin tone insane, man he's hung like Saddam Hussein, it's crazy\nWhat the fuck should I do?\nHe gotta Ruth's Chris dick, and mine's a drive-thru....\nI think it's time to tell Katie my goodbyes\n'Cause I simply can't survive\nAfter seeing what was in between his thighs\nSo I tell her\n\n[Chorus 3]\n\"That this dude's got a dick that I don't comprehend\nI had to move my neck to see it end to end\nI mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense\nAnd I think it's for the best if this comes to an end\nBecause the sex with him must have been the best\nAnd I would say let's just be friends\nBut I think I would just think about his dick all the time, so goodbye\"\nThen she told me, \"Dicky, I don't really know what to say\nBecause I dated this dude in the second grade\nSo I don't know about his dick, now let's go home and get you laid\"\n\n[Outro]\nAnd then I took her to my crib, and you know that we belly slapped\nAnd I gave her an O like I was selling crack\nAnd when I came, I pulled out and nutted all over her left thigh\nAnd upper mid-section region, you can call that the pelvis\nSome would even call that the pubic bone\nLeave the pubes at home, making this up on the spot\nFuck you know about it?\nI'm about to go papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 my dick and ride it\nAw, fuck, I think I just actually said I was about to\nMake a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 version of my own dick and ride it\nAnd I could understand how that, that could sound gay\nBut, like, you gotta realize that I was just freestylin'\nSo like I wasn't really in control of what I was sayin'\nAnd, I mean, 'cause it ain't me, I, I\nReal rap I am about to papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 my dick, I won't even lie about that\nI got, you know, the ingredients is right in front of me like laid out\nLike, no bullshit, newspaper\nI don't even know what the fuck you would call that shit, putty I guess\nIt's about to get real sexual up in here, huh\nBut I am not gon' ride it, that, that ain't me\nI mean that's how I free, it came off the, the, the brain\nYeah, you know, if I, if I was thinkin' that then it is what it is but I, I, I ain't gon' act on it\nHeh, you know what I'm sayin', I ain't gonna act on that shit\nBut I am about to put that shit on the wall, though\nThe, uh, the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, cast mold of my dick, so, there's that\nAll right, holla at me"

yeah, I'm so Steve\nNowadays, bitches tryna crack, got 'em ODing\nLike, how them hoes want to get it with L?\nThey know it's cold enough to charge, like a letterman sale\nIf they gon' stand behind the bars, I'm in federal jail\nI'm going far like a general mail\nOn that note, I got the fellas saying \"What up,\" the tape, what up?\nThe same motherfucker playing with his steak cut up\nI'm great, shut up, the flowing, no debate, just us\nI'm out of shape, but I'm straight to fuck\nYeah, you know I got a chicken in the condo\nI was sick of getting off beat, she a bongo\nNow she playing with the hard D, being Rondo\nDrunk and go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow\nHow I'ma do?\nI got your ex coming next like a W do\nI gotta flex, I'm the best, now I'm being direct\nI'm unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press\nI'm kinda vexed by the trash like I'm cleaning a mess\nCause they as real when they rap as a Chia's a pet\nThey old news, stocks plummet, men's leg hair, they ain't cut it\nForget about your era, Pat Summitt\nFinesse writtens\nI wanna get a hundred bitches and fuck with the spitting\nReligious like a couple of post-marital Christians\nI've been official, Dick Bevetta a living\nYou better dig it like you bitches got a mill in the ditch\nI'm killing this shit I been kicking like a villainous ninja\nMy shit is gripping when I run it, how the fuck I be slipping?\nI be intimate with them hoes, she never flummoxed\nI take chick, pee, and smash, I call it hummus\nAnd I be funny with this shit, I'm just playing\nBut still nobody fucking with the kid, I'm just saying, ah\nGot a chicken parm on the date, it seem\nBut I don't even know the broad, she just grating the cheese\nI don't even got a job, I just blaze and free\nBut still they give a boy bands, 98 Degrees\nSo come fuck with me\nI got a couple hundred bitches doing drugs with me\nAnd I got a couple dozen bitches tryna hug Dicky\nAnd I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me\nHey, that's a good ass life\nOnly thing I got left, find a good ass wife\nBut yo, I gotta hit these hoes first, don't tell Mom\nBut in a year I'ma bend over Michelle Obama\nBruh, you know I gotta do it while I'm hot\nI'm tryna get blew in most states, like Barack\nI'm tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock\nAnd put her on D till we O, J Watt\nI never hit the scene, when I do, I'm high and wasted\nI'm fucking with them jeans, love them bitches high waisted\nI run around your team, you a player but I'm Naismith\nAnd I Command V, while you copy, I just paste it, face it\nHotel got 'em puffing on the L, going harder than some hail, you ain't knew it\nIf everybody had to tell the truth and you had to pick a dude spitting better than your dude, can't do it\nTelling me, damn, you got bitches, damn, you got hoes\nDamn, you got money, but damn, I got flow\nDamn, you got riches, damn, you got clothes\nDamn, you got honeys, but damn, I got soul, hold up\nThis shit I'm making's always tight, it's like a yoga store\nThey all up in the other boat, it's why I'm overboard\nI'm taking time to do it right, it's like a soda pour\nCause we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for\nI been packing the band-wagon, the man cracking\nThe man packing the stands, had them clapping they hands\nTagging they Grams, Manhattan was ham\nSlapping the fans, playing having the plan\nFans rapping the jams, sagging my pants\nYou see the type of shit I do on the track?\nHot shit, like I poop in the jacket\nWon't mack your bitch, but yo, I'm bout to come and mack your clique\nYour whole friend group fucking with Dick (no hetero)\nI yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio\nThey ball all retarded, Cuba Gooding up in radio\nI long for the moment I can say that's not debatable\nI'm past that, I wonder who appreciate it like a Snapchat\nAflac, duck the dude, I'm going hard for the grind, but I tuck this move\nI made war with the rhymes, motherfuck your crew\nThese bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew\nI'm too nice, like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo twice\nAs in double as fuckable as he was and dude tries\nTo be subtle and get her cuddling\nVenting her troubles and getting her truffles\nAnd ending up befuddled when she don't fuck him\nAnd someone tell him, \u201cListen, you bugging\nShe never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you\nSo why all the trouble?\u201d but he rebuttal with\n\"I think I just love her, so I would shudder at the thought\nOf being anything other than nice?\" (I\u2019m that nice)\nHeat bang like I caught a body/port-a-potty\nIt wasn't even deep, dang, shit is still a hobby\nIt's two bad bitches sleeping on me, threesome\n'Cause now these bitches want to help, but he don't need none\nI'm all time, like the Wall at the Bank\nYou've no shot, like you drawing a blank\nHonestly, you probably couldn't hang, man, I've been drawing a blank\nGiving you lines, while you sitting there and drawing a blank\nSo go in the rink, chilling like it's dough in the bank\nAnd I\u2019m flowing danker than a grower in Napa\nGrowing the stankest cannabis\nDoing rap and pro-est smacking the hoe-est rappers\nAnd showing the total package, like my flaccid is growing fatter\nSamoan cracker, dapper rapper, had to keep going\nYeah, that rap is a rap, I know you rappers napping, don't know it\nThere\u2019s a dagger pita pappa, tapping on the window\nIt\u2019s a real accurate metaphor of what you having in store\nAnd I be snapping, I mean I be splashing on the - pane me your rain\nFalling quicker than Aladdin for his dame\nOh, you better than me?\n\n[Outro]\nBruh"

I forgot all about this shit\nThis shit is fucking crazy... hahahaha...\"\n\"Holy shit..!\nWow, I'm like, uncomfortably high...\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm getting hungry than a muthafucka\nPut some chicken nuggets in the oven at 400\nWhere'd I put that honey mustard\nLookin all around the cupboard for that muthafucka\nUntil I discovered a custard, I covered wit butter from last week\nHow long do them thangs keep?\nGuess I better ask Jeeves\nGo get ma computer but I'm staring at the damn screen (wow)\nDamn D, you forgetting what ya task be\nThe puff puff pass, gotcha gassed\nNow ya man is fucked\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff\nBut I think I'm way too high\nAnd I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit\nBut I think ma brains too fried\nAnd yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it\nI'm praying that I make it\nAfraid I'm goin to dieeeee\nI'm too blazed, it's too late\nTo save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I'm freakin out up in this bitch\nCan't control it and ma homies passin round another spliff\nSo I bolted to the BR\nConsulted with the mirror\nLil Dicky please step up, you pathetic\nCause the weed in you beating you\nThen all a sudden I'm on the toilet beating ma penis blue\nBut I ain't cummin because as I'm imagining fucking something\nThat pretty girl I'm humping\nBecoming my fuckin cousin, or mother or brother\nOr some other fucking disgusting person\nMa brain is bein strange, cause I'm high as a plane\nI ain't deranged, I'm just saying it's a violent strain\nSo I go back to the back where they packing up cigars\nDipping snacks, kicking back, staring at some Avatars\nThen I flipped, took a decade and a half to make that shit\nYet they couldn't put a second and a half up in that script\nHow the fuck a human being wanna fuck a\nBlueish green 7' 3'' tail having ass thing\nMan I'm high as fuck\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff\nBut I think I'm way too high\nAnd I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit\nBut I think ma brains too fried\nAnd yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it\nI'm praying that I make it\nAfraid I'm goin to dieeeee\nI'm too blazed, it's too late\nTo save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high\n\n[Verse 4]\nRock hard cock, cause I'm watching Katy Perry\nAnd in her video the whole world's made of candy (wow)\nDamn, I ain't even got no candy\nSo now I'm at the fucking C store\nWhere ya man be torn than a mafucka\nPeanut m&m's or a Twix\nCan't commit, so I count the benefits on ma hands\nGoddamn now I'm weary of the man -- yeah the cashier\nHomeland, Nazir!\nS-s-s-so damn tweaked I can't even cross the mothafuckin street\nGotta wait until that muthafucka's green\nNow I'm back up at the crib, and I'm laughin at giraffes long necks\nGotta shit, but the path to the bathroom is complex\nCrafted a long text, took about an hour\nTook a scary shower, now I'm sitting naked on the ground\nMan I'm fucked up. I'm bout to call ma mom up and tell her what's up\nThis sucks I'm high as fuck\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff\nBut I think I'm way too high\nAnd I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit\nBut I think ma brains too fried\nAnd yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it\nI'm praying that I make it\nAfraid I'm goin to dieeeee\nI'm too blazed, it's too late\nTo save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high\n\n[Outro]\nOh my god\nThis shit is not fun, man\nI can't stop thinkin' 'bout weird ass shit\nWatching Lady Gaga\nI can't stop thinking about who the fuck Alejandro is\nWho the fuck is he?\nJerking off, I came during the position change\nLike, in the porn, like when they was changing positions, I came\nAin't nothing worse than that\nNothing worse than that shit, everybody knows that\nAye, but like, I've been thinking 'bout like\nWhen the sun goes behind the clouds, what does it do?\nLike, does it smile?\nLike, what does it do, does it show it's dick?\nIt's something to think about\nLike it's doing something, and we can't see it\nSo like, what's it doin? I don't even know like, what it's doing\nBecause, if it's showing it's dick, I'm tryna see that\nI bet the sun got a big ass dick\nAlright, I gotta go to bed\nFuck, I forgot about them chicken nuggets from the first verse\nThey still in the oven, damn, probably burnt as shit by now\nI guess I gotta go get them, fire hazard\nGoodnight"

All right, you fucking with the god now\nLong growl, pimping handle business like a boss now\nTossed down, talking shit to Simba, 'bout to cost clown\nScar tell the youngun that he killed his pops though\nFor real motherfucker? He revealed his hops bro\nAnd clocked on that motherfucking sucker with a cross\nRocked uncle with a couple then he sunk him wit a toss\nHe don't play that shit, brothers and lacrosse\nReal talk, the dogs done finished him off\nAnd Pride Rock was back where it started at\nThe meals back, fields packed wit the hardest cats\nFor real jack, the animals is feeling that\nThe real is back and I just spit the realest rap, ya know\nAnd Simba must've hit it hella freaky\nGotta keep it PG but you see Rafiki with the peewee baby\nThat right there mean he murkin' it right\nThe dude piped but that's just the circle of life\n\n[Outro]\nHey, I was just fuckin' around when I said that I jerked off\nTo the scene where Nala and Simba like got back together\nI didn't really jerk off, I was too young\nI did get hard though, I was hard as shit\nI ain't gon' lie about that\nI was, you know\nI don't know why I was hard\nBut it just felt like the type of moment where one would be hard"

You know Rae Sremm?\nI like 'No Type,' but I really hate them\"\nLike I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is\nI'm past due on student loans and my rent\nBut I just bought new J's and shit\nGoing way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them\nMy mom says I should go back to classes\nBut I'm in the strip club and I'm tapping asses\nAnd bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis\nBut she lies a lot and can't kick the habit\nI've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards\nAnd they give two cents when I ain't even ask them\nTreat them like exams and I need to pass them\nI twisting dutches, I don't do the Backwoods\nBut this gas station don't carry those\nAnd I'm tryna smoke, man, how tragic\nHere's a 20 and some change, man, you can have it like\nNo\n\n[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]\nOh well\nOh well\nOh well"

That would be... an exaggeration\nI don't think anybody else sucks their own dick\nI also don't suck mine, it was a clear joke\nLike i don't think people need to be homophobic about that\nNor is there anything wrong with gay people\nI don't know like what I can or cannot say at this point\nLike what can I say? Here's what I can say\nIs that on the note of swearing on bible\nIt's crazy to me that like our whole country is run off like principles of religion\nI probably shouldn't say that either but it's like crazy\nLike a president couldn't be elected unless he was like an outgoing Christian\nThis seems like such a... You know like in 200 years no one's gonna be thinking that way\nIt's just gonna become an antiquated line of thinking\nKind of like how you look back at slavery now\nDefinitely can't say that, delete that last part\nBut it's the same you know what I mean like people\nAh, whatever"

Significantly?\nCool, that's good\nIt was super loud\n\n[Verse]\nFirst of all, this shit about me\nI ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing\nI been waitin' pretty long to get on some shit and rip it for Dicky\nSo just consider this my damn theme song, baby\nI been working hella hard, though\nThere's people telling me I'm 'bout to be a star, bro\nBut when I play 'em some of this, they like nobody want the pissed Lil Dicky\nYou the funny kid, that's where your card go\nThat metaphor about my lane, if you're retardo\nI'm bubblin' like I'm in a soda, word to Fargo\nI'm tryna get the fuckin' fame\nAnd it's a tricky little game you gotta play\nSometimes you gotta tell your heart \"No\"\nHere's the problem I been havin' (Uh)\nI wanna make my favorite type of music (Uh)\nAnd the shit I like to bump is not the type I'm brewin'\nI be on that \"Fuck the world, you motherfuckers losin'\" type of shit\nLike all you haters, look at what the fuck I'm doing\nAll my favorite rap is not amusing\nAnd I love my funny stuff, I hope it's not confusing\nI'm just saying, when you doing something time consumin'\nEvery now and then you wanna spazz\nWhy I didn't go with jazz, muhfucka\nGet up in yo ass, muhfucka\nY'all are trash, you ain't even know the half\nI could rattle off a lot if I position the rap game\nBut honestly I'm not in the position for that claim\nTo carry any weight, I just gotta carry on and wait\n'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight\nHypothetically, though, I'd probably tell you that I'm better than you'll ever be, bro\nI probably tell you it's objective, I'm more impressive\nYou pressin' play, and form a perspective\nI'm guessin' more or less it won't be competitive\nY'all adorable, sedative kind of rap is so deplorably edited\nNothin's worse than when a moron's repetitive\nI don't get it, how is everyone the same dude?\nThe rookie walkin' on the court like, \"Man, I can't lose\"\nThey playing Dicky, everybody in the room be like, \"That's some shit\"\nPlay 'em yo' bum ass, they be like \"That's some shit\" (Bums)\nY'all are bubbles wit' the rappin'\nLil Dicky get it popping, you could say he bubble wrappin' (Uh)\nThe irony in all of this is I been funny rappin'\nYet the youngin snappin' to the point where all of y'all look funny rappin' (Uh)\nCongratulations, y'all can write a hook\nAt my graduation, they was sayin' I could write a book\nIf a Rotten Tomatoes site existed for us rappers\nI would be a 97, y'all would hover 'round a 64 (Uh)\nLittle Dicky spit that Pixar\nHope you seeing why I really like to spit hard\nOnly problem is I'm rappin' to rappers\nTo the people that be listenin', that world doesn't matter\nWanna know what the advantage of the rapper who black is?\nThe N-word is his antagonist\nBefore you get all huff and puff about it, think about it, be analysts\nThe fact they always use, it's no accident\nFor example, I could be like \"Go figure\nI don't think I'm one to fuck with all you ho ______\"\nY'all could fill in the blank\nBut that'll make it so they don't gotta rap at a rapper\nThat applies to every detractor\nBut even if I had a word like it, the nerd never disturbed\nIt's absurd but I'm looking 'round and ain't nobody verse me\nI don't think a mothafucka's ever tried to hurt me\nEveryone I see has been supportive on this journey\nLike where my haters at? I'm thirsty (Uh)\nI just really wanna talk my shit, be like, \"Y'all ain't shit\"\nBut y'all ain't shit, like, y'all don't exist\nI could talk about the people that are dicks but I feel like it's whack\nThat'll get old quick, Robin Williams in Jack\nWho the fuck is my antagonist?\nIs it you? Is it you? (Is it you? Is it you?)\nIf it's you, let me tell you somethin'\nYou ain't even got a clue 'bout the shit that's comin'\nYou don't wanna be the dude in five years like\n\"The fuck, I dissed that\nShit was pretty clear, how the fuck I miss that?\" (Uh)\nYou know that I ain't fucking light, bruh\nI just fucked around and did this overnight, bruh\nI just fucked around and quit a fucking job\nWhere I was makin' triple digits then the comma got involved, dog (Uh)\nThis wasn't rappin' or trappin'\nThis was rappin' or a big old fuckin' house wit' a family\nWho the fuck is listenin' that's been making Dicky so angry? (Uh)\nIs it you? Is it you?\nI'm just waitin' on some non-believers\nThe writing isn't on the wall, it's comin' out your speakers (Uh)\nAnybody disagreein' being so facetious, homie I mean it\nForget the website, I'm the only mothafuckin' rap genius (Uh)\nWhere you doubters at? I'm tryna hear it\nMaybe it's the mothafuckas never paying mind to lyrics\nI would dumb it down for y'all to try make it more appealin'\nBut the ones who hang on every word think I'm kinda peerless (Yeah)\nBut even wit' no attention, you can kinda tell this mothafucka killin' this section\nYou can kinda tell this motherfucker still an erection\nBut gettin' harder by the minute, just admit it, it's sexy\n(I'm a boner)\nThe funny fact about this shit, I gotta rap about the fact I wanna rap about this shit\nTo even rap about this shit\nNobody been sleepin' on Dicky\nIt's only been a year and bitches been sleepin' on Dicky\nNobody took over the game with they first tape (With they first tape)\nThis mothafucka hasn't struggled since the first grade (Since the first grade)\nAdd it up, there's no excuse to go berserk, Dave\nCan't debate the shit, you got to skip, you not on first take (Whoa)\nSo what the fuck am I mad for?\nWhat's some other shit that I could actually spazz for?\nMaybe it's the fact that I been stuck in this lab for\nA hunnid fuckin' days straight cookin' up raps or\nThe fact this shit been takin' over every thing in life\nI gotta make it so I made the call to leave it all behind\nThat's my girl, that's my world, that's beyond bein' busy\nNow the only one that gets to David Burd is Lil Dicky\n\n[Outro]\nSee, I told you this about me\nGo on and look up in the mirror, see without D\nWho you hate, boy?\nOnly care about me, said I'm straight, boy\nMaybe I'm the one that gotta hit when I wanna murder shit\nY'all probably thinking \"Who is David Burd?\" and shit\nY'all just wanna hear some LD\nBut I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing\n[Instrumental break]"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Lil Dicky]\nYeah, I feel like people are really weird about admitting when they're scared\nIf you're not scared ever, you're just lying or something. You're being weird\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]\nTen days in the Bay left\nAnd I don't mean to overthink that\nGot a one-way straight to LAX\nAnd I ain't blinked yet\nI know you think that\nI done figured out this whole thing\nLike where his chink at?\nSegue to Lil Dicky getting bigger than Yao Ming\nBut can I shrink that? Where my shrink at?\nI don't know what to feel, everything has gotten totally real\nEverything I always wanted right in front of me with nobody near\nSo it's weird that I'm overly scared, but I'm so unprepared\nHolding a beer, I'm witholding the fear\nNot in the clear but I'm kind of revered\nAnd yeah I might appear like the chill type\nThe veneer's not real in the real-life\nWhat it feel like?\nThanksgiving I was missing, I ain't even miss 'em\nGirlfriend hella distant, I ain't even listen\nOnly shit I really care about is spittin writtens\nThis is the beginning\nI'm just getting into the game\nMy world's not spinning the same\nThe shit looking like it's bigger than Dave\nIt's so crazy\nBut when all this sit in the stake\nI can't brake\nEven if I'm afraid it might change me\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Azadeh]\nBaby if you let me\nYou know I could get deep\nBaby hope you ready\nI'm coming through\nRunning you\nThat's what I do\nJust know that it's all for you\nSo what you gonna choose?\nAfraid to say OK\n\n[Chorus: Azadeh]\nAnd I know I'm not gonna get in the way\nBut I'm afraid\nWho I want to be is what I became\nBut I'm ashamed\nAin't no coming back\nFacing what I wanted\nBut it's all fucking weird\nAnd now I'm really scared\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]\nI ain't made from the projects\nBut you know I treat the game like a project\nSo you know it's not the same kind of progress\nDifferent process, but I digress\nOther rappers didn't blow overnight\nThey ain't have a 9-5 that was totally ripe\nThey was all up on the grind from the moment they write\nAt 25, hadn't even done a show in my life\nIt's like - \"Damn, I'm a rapper, how did that happen?\"\nI was making ass then back when\nOnly used to rapping to my Mac then pack then\nViews came through, like \"Shoot, let's practice\"\nTrying to tell you I'm not bred for this shit\nDespite that, feeling like I'm meant for this shit\nBut like that, everything depends on this shit?\nAnd I ain't betting against it\nBut I ain't had a moment to reflect what I'm betting against it\nI'm next even though it's pretentious, I sense it\nRelentless, but it leave me defenseless\nI guess I should learn to accept it but it's hectic\nOh, you want a condensed list?\nI'm worried that I'm about to give my all to it, 100%\nYou ain't got to know it all to discover what's left\nPretty fucking intense\nAnd I'm worried that I got a lot of gall when it comes to success\nTelling y'all that it's 100%\nBut what happens if I fall short of what I call the surest of bets?\nCause what's 100%?\nWhat's 100% is that it'll take a lot to make me content\nAnd I'm about to chase around a legend that I fucking invented\nWhile I'm neglecting everybody that I love and respected\nBecause I hate the thought of coming in second\nAnd I don't want to do no second guessing when it comes to progressing\nBecause I really couldn't stomach regretting my effort\nWhen I'm at the end and I'm assessing if I could have done better\nI better be able to be it than never, or be the best ever\nBut if somehow I'm really that special then I'm about to deal with mad pressure\nI fear that when I finish my assessment I'mma be in depression\nBecause I'll see a lot of me is regressing\nIt's obvious to me that to be the best a lot of me is repressing itself\nI wonder what I'll see in reflections?\nI wonder if I'll run into a woman, cool, but come in second\nOr if I'm bound to be the fool at the weddings\nAlone and regretting the whole thing\nNow you're seeing why it's so big\nWhat would y'all do if y'all were the old me?\nGet involved and you gotta give the whole thing\nThis is no fling, this devoting\nEvery mother fucking part of yourself\nNo matter whatever the cards you was dealt\nYou going all in\nI don't know about y'all, but I'm gone\nAnd I don't know if I'm balling or bawling\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Azadeh]\nIf you let me\nYou know I could get deep\nBaby  hope you ready\nI'm coming through\nRunning you\nThat's what I do\nJust know that it's all for you\nSo what you gonna choose?\nAfraid to say OK\n\n[Chorus: Azadeh]\nAnd I know I'm not gonna get in the way\nBut I'm afraid\nWho I want to be is what I became\nBut I'm ashamed\nAin't no coming back\nFacing what I wanted\nBut it's all fucking weird\nAnd now I'm really scared"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAyy, man... man\nAyy... Ayy\nI guess y'all on board\nYoung Man couldn't leave that shore\nHad the life they made for him till he seeked out more\nBoat rock, couldn't see that storm, he'll get up though\nHe know he close, it's too late to jump ship (Ayy)\n\n[Chorus]\nAw, damn! Aw, damn! You that motherfucker shit\nI know, this here became a trip: Cabo\nUp in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know\nAnd you too must be rockin' with Lil Dicky: Bono\nIt's like I hit the lotto, I had to hit the wall though\nI couldn't see it for a minute, shit was hidden: Waldo\nThey treat it like I'm goin' crazy, I'm just prayin', I don't\nIt's just I know, it's just I know\n\n[Verse 1]\nI saw the world like, \"Hold up\"\nDamn near fakin' on the side\nLet me take you on a ride\nLet me tell you bout the one who couldn't take the 9 to 5\nUse to take the 95 down to Richmond\nBumpin' Jigga up in the ride\nUse to think along and drive\n'Bout my drive\nUsed to wonder why\nUsed to wonder when the world'l see like I'm seein' mine\nUse to whine\nUse to wanna shine\nUsed to wanna dine\nUsed to talk to bitches in my mind when they were walkin' by\n\"Girl, what's happenin'? Girl what's happenin'?\"\nI ain't really 'bout to get involved that's what's happenin'\nErrything I knew was unevolved like a Baptist\nLayin' on my matress\nPrayin' I could have this, and\nNow when I get Tinder matches\nThey think they've been Catfished\nNow I been controlling how we livin' like a facist\nNow I got this weight up off my shoulders like a strapless\nRemember this shit was hapless\nRemember the day it happened\nAw, you the shit Dave, you be killin' everything you did\nGot the whole world talkin' all about what you did\nGot your old girl talkin' all about what you is\nGot your old world lookin' like it's his you ain't here\nI been fuckin' for the fuck of it\nAnd one of the bitches I been fuckin' with\nBeen wondering how I can work this much and stomach it\nShe wonders what I want from it\nI said, \"We don't gotta get into it\"\nShe like \"Nah, just do it\"\nShe a psychology student\nShe always followin' up\nFind the guy to be amusing as fuck\nUsually I'll answer her truthfully\nBut truthfully, I'm unusually used to being unusually good at internalizing when music is not provided\nBut I humor hoe\nAsk her if she ever saw the Truman Show\nShe like yeah\nI like well, when I saw that shit I was convinced I was livin' like Jim\nA similar situation where I was the basis of everyone's entertainment\nLike really up in the basement talkin to y'all\nIn the mirror because I thought Lil David was some American hero\nI know it's selfish and all\nBut I just felt it's my call\nI was a ten year old then\nBy 2010 I was wrong\nI'm like\n\n[Chorus 2]\n\"Aw, damn! Aw, damn!\nYou the motherfucker though\"\nI know\nThat shit became a trip, Cabo\nUp in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know\nAnd you too must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono\nIt's like I hit the lotto\nI had to hit the wall though\nI couldn't see it for a minute\nShit was hidden, Waldo\nThey treat it like I'm goin' crazy\nI'm just playin', I don't\nIt's just I know\nIt's just I know\n\n[Verse 2]\nTwenty three bars up in my apartment\nI am debarred\nGotta do this shit\nI gotta recharge\nBut I gotta be smart\nMovin' up that ladder company\nStar, fuck it, that ain't nothin'\nI am *the* star\nSpittin' like a retard\nWork was like a prison\nI'm just seein' bars\nMy boss was all up in my camp\nAnd I'm just seein' Lars\nI been a heavyweight, Muhammad Ali\nAnd if he can mold that out of \"Clay\"\nThen I can turn the Lil D\nSo now I'm snappin' like I'm Truman\nBut off and on\nThere's always somethin' in the way\nI should be off and gone\nGirl I'm sorry if this draggin'\nI just need you to imagine\nBein' stuck up on the land without a captain\nWhen everyday is average\nAnd everyday you feelin' like a captive\nAnd feel like somethin' seriously lackin'\nAnd then you fear what could happen if you just leave it on the table like napkins\nBut, yo, you really fearin' hitting them rappin's and leaving everything behind\nCause you don't know what that horizon brings\nBut girl you gotta know what kind of fish you is\nSurvival instinct kicked in\nSink or swim\nI flipped a playlist\nQuit my day gig\nNow, I'm on a boat, Lonely Island\nIrony, and you still been tryin' to figure how I work this tirelessly\nBut girl\nThis is everything I've thought\nThis for everything I've fought\nThis for who I am to me becomes to y'all\n\n[Bridge]\n(Go)\nThey tellin' me \"nah\"\nBut I just be tellin' them \"yeah\" (Go)\nI just be tellin' them \"yeah\" (Go)\nI just be tellin' them \"yeah\"\nTell 'em I'm gone (Yeah)\nI just pretend I ain't scared (Go)\nDon't even know I was there (Go)\nDon't even know if I care\nCause girl this is Truman approachin' the wall\nUntil I'm me I am nothin' at all\nUntil I'm free I will not see beyond\nI had to be who I was all along\nAy *crash*\n\n[Verse 3]\nI think I mighta broke it down\nHoppin' on the fuckin' steps like ain't no around\nOpen up that door, you bet, ship ain't goin' down\nGuess the only thing left is to take a bow\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAw, damn! Aw, damn!\nYou that motherfucker shit\nI know\nThis ship became a trip, Cabo\nUp in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know\nAnd you too must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono\nIt's like I hit the lotto\nI had to hit the wall though\nI couldn't see it for a minute\nShit was hidden, Waldo\nThey treat it like I'm goin' crazy\nI'm just prayin', I don't\nIt's just I know\nIt's just I know\n\n[Outro]\nFuck!\nThat felt good\nWell, that's all I got\nThe show is over, as they say\nHonestly, I just think that part in the Truman Show where his boat hits the wall is really the exact\nMoment that I'm at in my own life right now\nUh... metaphorically, of course\nAnd I'm ready for - I think I'm ready for it\nLike I've been thinkin' about it, I think I'm ready\nI mean, if I'm being completely transparent with y'all\nUh, like my lifestyle hasn't really changed that much\nUh, you know, considering, uh, where I think I'm at musically\nLike I'm still at the point right now where pretty much any bitch that tweets at me anything remotely flirtatious\nI have seen not just one of your pictures, I have seen the entire catalog\nThat's the type of shit that's goin' down over here right now, so...\nI am definitely ready for that, uh, next step, y'know what I'm sayin'?\nI think it's close, too\nI think it's close\nLike, uh, Diddy tweeted about me\nUh, y'know, that... I don't know if he handles his own Twitter\nI would assume he probably doesn't, actually\nBut, like, I'm so confident that I feel as though, like, me and Diddy will have a moment just about this outro\nLike when we're both sittin' next to each other smokin' cigars\nAnd bein' like, \"Ay, remember when you said that shit on that outro?\"\nLike, and I'm like, \"Yeah. That's, this is the exact moment I - I did that for, y'know what I'm sayin'?\"\nBring the - bring the beat back up. I don't know why\nLike, keep, loop everything. I wanna be talkin' for minutes, yeah, uh, y'know what I'm sayin'?\nLike, uh, shout out my Macbook Pro\nHad that shit since '09\nI made my first song ever on it\nLike, when I called myself Lil Dicky\nI made my, like, fuckin' album song on that shit\nAnd we survived, baby\nUh, shoutout Allen Iverson, Larry David, Will Smith, and Kobe Bryant\nFor makin' me the man that I am today\nBoth on and off the court\nShout out my mother\nWhat a great woman\nShe's so mad I recorded these conversations\nShe - she honestly went crazy\nIt took so much convincing to allow this\nBut, she's awesome\nShe's adapting to the rap game, as we all are\nLook, I just want to get this to a place where I can sell TMZ pictures of my actual asshole\nHeh, y'know?\nCause, well, I, I think that'd be such a feat\nIf I could actually create, like, an alt alias\nAnd sell TMZ pictures of my own asshole\nLike, profit off of that\nThat, I would totally do it\nI don't know why Seth Rogen's not already doing it\nI don't, I'm seein' the signs that it's not, I'm\nI think I'm seein' the signs\nI hope I am\nIf I'm really just misreading all these signs\nThen, I am 100% gonna have, like, a legitimate nervous breakdown\nUh, at some point very soon\nSo, we'll find out about that\nBut I see some signs\nLike, like I really am not fuckin' that much\nBut, like, the other day I did fuck a bitch to music\nLike, I fucked a bitch to some Miguel\nAnd that's kind of new for me if I'm bein' real\nLike, I had never actually done it before\nBut I was feelin' like I was some king shit\nY'know what I'm sayin'?\nSo, I was like, \"Man, Imma fuck this bitch to some Miguel right now\"\nUh, actually to be completely real to you, I, I will never fuck a girl to music again\nI found the whole thing to feel, like, completely cliche\nLike, I don't need my emotions dictated to me by, like, music\nIt makes me feel like I'm in a TV scene\nTakes all the, like, realness out of the moment for me\nLike, actually, was actually super weirded out by it\nSo, but still, like, I am about to let my hair down\nAnd, I don't know, I just feel like it's all comin'\nI feel like, like, I'm literally, like, about to find out about everything\nAnd it's exciting\nAnd, I, y'know, I, I had pinkeye last week\nAnd I remember thinkin' that, as I, like, was like, real down\nCause I was, like, trying to keep recording and shit\nBut I was thinking, \"What would Michael Jordan do?\"\nAnd he would play through the pinkeye\nSo that's why I'm in here\nI'm still not fully recovered, y'know what I'm sayin'?\nI, I'm definitely clearin' up\nLike, it's totally on the upswing\nBut, I just want you know I did record this shit through pinkeye\nAlright, I could talk for fuckin' years\nLegitimate years\nThis is an outro to an out\nYou see how long I talk with outros to songs\nBut, goddamn\nLook, I need to get out of here\nI'm 'bout to go take a Khalifa\nRest up\nThat's right, I did invent that phrase just there\n\"Take a Khalifa\"\nY'know what I'm sayin'?\nI also invented \"That's what she said\"\nBut I get no credit for it\nUh, oh, shoutout to Dickheads, obviously\nFundin' this whole operation\nWhatchu know about a Kickstarter, man?\nWhatchu know about the best fans in the world?\nSeriously\nThank you guys, I appreciate it\nHonestly, you made my dreams come true, and that's fact\nCouldn't have done this without y'all\nUh, I'd like to shout out my dick\nI know, y'know, we haven't had the smoothest relationship\nBut, I feel as though by kind of putting our issues out there\nLike, we have become something bigger than we could have been otherwise\nAnd, hopefully soon you will be rewarded for your patience\nAnd I will be rewarded for my patience\nI, and, I respect you\nI'd like to shout out my brain\nMy brain got the hardest verse on the whole goddamn album\nI hope my brain starts gettin' some feature looks\nBut he don't just hop on shit\nFuck, I, I got nothin' left\nI'm out\nI'm a professional rapper\nLong live LD\nAnd in case I don't see ya\n\"Good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight.\""

I Love You is on the TV, Dicky tearin' up\nGo up to the bathroom, I have to\nMy dentist say I gotta make an effort, now it's time to floss\nHoller at my dog, and I call the muhfucker to me, and\nGet a leash and take him out to walk\nRoll around the ave, I put his shit up in a bag\nAnd then a whip pull up, the windows down, this bitch look out and asking how she get back on the highway\nTold that bitch to drive straight\nAnd take a left on Honeycut\nBut stay up in the right lane\nCause  it come up kinda quick\nYou see what the fuck I'm saying? Other people get to rap about, like\nHome cooked crack, and, like, jail and shit\nAnd I gotta spit a lotta shit about a motherfucking kid up in a crib that's got the central air\nIt's not fair, no one cares\nReal talk, I just wanna braid my hair\nAnd rap about whatever, bruh\nMoney, hoes, etcetera\nInstead of being clever every measure but I'm never gonna be...\n\n[Hook]\nRidin' round smoking weed wit my foreign bitch\nRidin' round smoking weed wit my foreign bitch\nMy window down, I'm riding to my new shit (Wish that was me...)\nGot my new bitch, got my, got my new bitch (This dude a G!)\nIon't camp off wit no j's they sell them hoes for free (What the fuck that mean?)\nNever payin' for no pussy, fuck them hoes for free\nThat's a fucking bawlaa\nHow can I become a bawlaa?\n\n[Outro]\n\"Yeah, like, it ain't fair\nLike, Kanye says shit like \"Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?

(on ciabatta)\nIt's stupid emphatic\nStomach is fucked I been poopin' erratic (damn)\nNew Santa Monica dude I just moved in in March\nAnd I'm bout to get into some Madness\nDon't confuse what my plan is\nI never go out (it's depressing)\nI meant that my brackets about get sandy\nThe beach on my house (ehh, more like three blocks away)\nI'm newly an Uncle (Uncle Dicky)\nMy bro had a baby (he did, she cute)\nI'll be on by the time she can talk\nHer first words'll be \"Dicky we made it!\" (that's a BABY)\nCan't wait to be famous (oh)\nThat shit gon' be wild (I bet I'll meet Drake)\nI'm lookin' at Jason Sudeikis like who my Olivia Wilde (I need an actress)\nI love Anna Kendrick (legitimate feelings)\nShe never tweet back (not once, ever)\nI figure she's busy or think that I'm creepy\nBut baby I'm not! (unless you like that shit)\nI just have this vision where both of us living like Bonnie and Clyde\nThat's you as a singer and me as a rapper\nWe could be like Jay and Beyonce for whites (that could be so cool)\nThat would be the life\nI'd buy the Sixers and make you my wife\nNah I'm just kiddin', I've only been smitten\nWith totally fictional characters right? (obviously we'd have to get to know each other)\nYou could be a grouch (that would suck)\nYou could be so mean (I hope not)\nYou could be the type that need warning with oral to avoid the cream (some bitches hate the taste of semen)\nThat's graphic as fuck (I suck my own dick)\nBut some bitches is bougie (I've kissed other men)\nForgive me, I just wanna make this pitch perfect I love all your movies (these ad-libs are fun)\nI need me some pussy (I'd buy it)\nI'm scared of the AIDS (the virus)\nI wish I was reckless\nThere's rappers that's been getting head up on stage (Danny Brown)\nI'm way too afraid (my dick is a pussy)\nMy dick been enraged\nBut soon when I'm fuckin in public post nut, he'll look up atcha boy and say \"Dicky we made it!\" (get 'em D)\n\nI'm just fuckin wit the flow\nYou know I still be on that ya ain't really fuckin wit da boy\nI got 150 different ways to cut dat\nLove rap\nSoon they'll be fuckin wit the dork like a humpback\nYeah I'm bout to bring the fun back\nEvery other rapper need to go and get a dunce cap\nNow I got a one track\nMind till I run rap\nMine till I'm done\nWack rhymes better run rap (run ho)\nMafucka shit is done wrapped (over)\nYou ain't wanna see me come back (nah)\nY'all hot for a summer in July in Arizona\nLil Dicky literally is where the sun at\nKnowing y'all, gotta show you where the sun at (hot)\nAll of y'all been bad where my son at? (hot)\nWhere my son at? (hot)\nWhere my son at? (hot)\nWhere my son at?

You know I mean?\nYour swag is a, is a real thing, I think\nAnd I've been looking at other rappers swag\nAnd being intimidated by it, but like why?\nI'm an impressive young man\n\n[Verse 1]\nI guess I could tell you I'm blowing up big\nAnd I'm 'bout to get money\nAlthough I ain't joking, America also agree that I'm funny\nThe rapping, you like it\nOh, this is some shit I picked up in my twenties\nI'm really a writer, you knew it, it's stupid\nI got an eight hundred, come fuck with that\nLil ho, come fuck with that\nHonestly I could have had whatever fucking job\nI wanted in the country\nBut I fuck with rap, real shit, bro, I fuck with rap\nAnd i don't mean it, like I fuck with that\nI mean it like I run amuck in that\nI talk about somebody cock and I buzz off that\nKnow I'm saying? I'm the man right now\nAct like ya man playing right now\nAct like I ain't get hundred granding in from the fans right now\nAct like I ain't planned that out\nAct like I'm not about to get them bitches from the mag\nPicture that right, cause I rap nice, I'm attractive to that type\nLiving that life and I'm naturally that likeable\nThat right dimple, not like the left, but it's barely worse\nBitches playing marry, fuck, kill, inevitably become Mz. Burd\nGo head and fuck them, I'm real and my jumper is ill\nY\u2019all got swag, but I got reservations\nY'all just boys and I'm the voice of my generation\nLike I really belive that, like I think I'd get us\n\n[Hook]\nRun it back, homie talking shit, pipe down\nI don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now\nYou can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight\nI've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right\nSwagga on a hundred milligram, I can play the villain, fam\nPut your boy in any room, I swear to god he still the man\nLil homie, I am Obama\nYou the man among some bitches, bunch of lying Juwannas\nFlex, run it back, homie talking shit pipe down\nI don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now\nYou can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight\nI've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right\nI ain't cocky I'm right, I ain't cocky I'm right\nEverything I say I do and I ain't stopping tonight\nSwagga, swagga, swagga, swagaa\n\n[Bridge]\nThat's really fun to say like that, y'all should try it\nIf you ever get some free time, or on my level\n\n[Verse 2]\nI never done acting, but somehow, I still get auditions for movies\nThe last one I went after Bob Odenkirk\nAnd that's Saul if you clueless\nThe way they react to my rapping\nIt show me, it's bigger than music\nAt shows they be laughing, then dancing\nThey never seen anyone do this\nCome fuck with that\nLil ho, come fuck with that\nWas in the number one department in the country\nI was one up in my class, coulda run with that\nBiz week, coulda run with that, then Lil D had a run with ads\nLil D wrote a couple for the League, got them on TV\nThen was done with that, y\u2019all high I'm matterhorn\nAnd no offense I matter more\nThe Rec League, like Steve, LD winning back to back\nWith scattered blacks, then smack y'all in scattegories\nYou in a trash, like category, I'm getting ass no statutory\nYou seeing red I'm matadoring\nYa rap is boring and wack deplorable\nLack the morals that make mine allegorical\nI'm the motherfucking man of my time right now\nGot ya whole team looking at the man, like damn\nThat's LeBron, that's Durant, that's Assange\nThat's your aunt, on my cock, say I can't\nEven parents fucking with me\nBro, I'm so comfy with myself, but here snuggle with me\nLike please, come here and snuggle\nSee what the fuck happen to you, you gon' like it, I'm real warm\nI shift my weight, so your legs won't fall asleep\n\n[Hook]\nRun it back, homie talking shit, pipe down\nI don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now\nYou can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight\nI've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right\nSwagga on a hundred milligram, I can play the villain, fam\nPut your boy in any room, I swear to god he still the man\nLil homie, I am Obama\nYou the man among some bitches, bunch of lying Juwannas\nFlex, run it back, homie talking shit pipe down\nI don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now\nYou can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight\nI've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right\nI ain't cocky I'm right, I ain't cocky I'm right\nEverything I say I do and I ain't stopping tonight\nSwagga, swagga, swagga, swagaa\n\n[Outro]\nI didn't even mention how nice I was at tennis neither\nSo, don't forget about that"

The Long Winded Answer\n(The number one on the charts!)\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]\nTwo truths and a lie: I've tried beans, I like wings, I'll die king\nTwo truths and a lie: I'm not gay, I've tried yay, it's my day\nTwo truths and a lie: I might go write a TV show and chill\nI might be up for a nine figure deal\nI used to wonder if Santa was real\nWould you believe that? Would you believe that shit?\nWhat would you believe?\nWe could start with the rap, flowing like malls like 'oh there's a Gap'\nGo on my call logs, dogs wanna chat\nBig dogs, missed calls\nLot of motherfuckers in the league no L\nJust had brunch with Embiid and Noel\nJust got sucked and was fucked by a dumb slut\nUsually I like 'em Ivy League, oh well\nSummer camp I been going ham I was a young man with that chopper\nThat\u2019s rifelry, yeah I like movies, I\u2019m going H.A.M. for that Oscar\nI'm way far on they radar like they know I'm coming that's Doppler\nThey boring to me that's Opera, I'm scoring beauties that's soccer\nMe and Jonah Hill smoke, then we talking shit bout how the rest of y'all blow\nThen we take a dip up in his pool, pretty cool\nNot the pool, shit is hot\nJust a view from a spot, shit is hot\nBunch of blonde bitches laughing all night\nAnd me and Busta Rhymes meet in Venice for a bite\nTalking shit about a comedy singer, shit is so light he tell me\nI can't disagree, get it right he tell me, I mean\nI thought by now he can see that I'm witty\nDown in L.A. I been running the city\nAsk anybody in music or film who got next in this bitch and they all saying Dicky\nI just do it like it's nothing to it\nLife getting pretty sweet like I fondue it\nI'm killing bitches in my lane on some T.

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Lil Dicky]\nAnd now a message from Hannibal Buress\nBlaa, uh, sorry, sorry\nAnd now a message from Hannibal Buress\n\n[Interlude: Hannibal Buress]\nAye, mane, I'm fucking with this shit. It's good to listen to a professional rapper for once, but Lil Dicky is a horrible rap name. That's some weird shit; you got grown men having to call you Lil Dicky in the streets like \"Aye, what's up Lil Dicky. Bars man, you be spittin' bars\". That's real inconsiderate for you to make that your rap name and it's probably - Is that the worst rap name? I saw a dude named Hogman, The Intruder, no, I just made that up, but it's it's not the worst rap name I've heard at all, man\n\nHere's some tips if you rappers wanna be more professional:\nFirst of all, stop rappin' over your own vocals at your concert. Clear your goddamn instrumental and rap over it, I don't wanna hear you rappin' over your raps, muthafuckas. Also, stop have thirty five people on stage - who are these people?! Are you travelin' with these people or did you hire them locally? Did you pay for their travel? Get all of those muthafuckas off of the stage. It's confusing. I don't like it. You can't do that at other jobs. You can't be an accountant like \"Hey I'm about to do your taxes, here's my thirty friends just standin' around doing nothing while I do your taxes\"; fuck outta here\n\nAlso, stop talkin' 'bout the same shit. I don't think you have a fresh take on havin' money. I'm tired of hearing about it, I don't, I don't think it's interesting. These muthafuckas need to mix it up. I think I've heard every perspective on havin' money or I used to have money and I oh I got money, I didn't have money, I got more money than you'll ever get, I never thought I would get this much money, I had money now I'm getting more money. Stop getting soo many chains. You don't need that many chains - you only need one chain. Or if you're 2 Chainz, you can have two chains, but not more than that"

(you won't have to say...)\nI feel like it'd be weird\nIf I said, \"I'm with the blacks\" (it's not like that)\nHow is it referred to?\nDon't worry, I'll make sure that everyone knows you're with us\n\n[Recreation Scene]\nThree o'clock rec ball\nPretty solid courts, real good runs\nWatched on the sidelines, didn't try to run\nCalling for next would be calling for death\nReal good black dude roll his ankle (ewww...)\nMexican guy on the side says, \"ay, carumbo\"\nNow there's a squad, thats only got four players\nAnd in jail the other team picks his replacement\nThey look around and my heart started racing\nOne guy is beelining straight up at David\nCause they probably think I'm a horrible player\nThey like, \"All right, take this white, skinny bitch~\"\nLittle did they know I'm a bad motherfucker on the court\nFirst play hit 'em with a cross, up-fake (swoosh)\nNext play, wide open three, like... wet (swoosh)\nThe yard taking notice, (yo)\nI take a charge, but they don't even notice (bro)\nDon't leave him open, his jumper is potent (ha)\nPat on the back\nFeel like a black\nDap, dap, dap\n\n[Exposed Scene]\nAll the sudden, a Mexican guy\nWalks on the court and says\nStop the game, stop the game, stop the game\nGets in my face\nSays, \"You know what he did?\"\nEveryone's frozen in place\nYou know what he did? (what'd he do? what'd he do?)\nHe raped some kids\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, not true! I said\nHe said, \"One was my niece!\"\nHold on, I can explain, I'm a rapper, I was on stage (you ain't no motherfuckin' rapper)\nYes, I am (we gon' rape you)\nNo, I am a rapper\nI'll spit, you want me to spit?\nI'll fucking spit! I'll...\nYou 'bout to get fucked, pendejo!\nListen, my dick sucks, my dick sucks\nUh.., that's just a hook\nRemember the name, Don Quixote\nThat's the guy that will fuck you later\nOkay, chismoso? (hahaha)\nThen he walked away\nI tried to play it cool, I'm like, \"Back to the game\"\nPunched in the back, (ah)\nThrown off the court\nI'm like, \"I'm with the Blacks!\" (that made it worse)\nSmack! smack! smack!\nI'm like, \"I didn't rape no kids, I just showed my sack\nYou never did that, like, with your friends?\" (ain't fuck nah, pussy)\nIt was just a joke!\nI believe in the art of the joke (that don't sound very funny)\nYeah, but you should've seen it, it worked\nThey laughed, the joke was successful\nThey whipped my ass, (pa pa)\nNow I'm not with the Blacks (you ain't black)\n\n[Cell Scene]\nLick my wounds in my cell, (eeehhuuu)\nTell Raheem all the facts (this guy walked on the court...)\nHe like, Oh, no, Don Quixote?\" (yeah)\nThat's the most dangerous Mexican (really?)\nAnd now all the Blacks not protecting you\nYeah, no shit, and by the way\nThey didn't take kindly to me saying I was with the Blacks\nWell, now...

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYep, ayy\nYep, ayy\nMan, you know who it is\n\n[Verse 1]\nFriday fucking night, we 'bout to do this right\nDicky rollin to the club, he about to find his wife\n'Cause he fresher than a kid that called his mom a fuckin' hoe\nBunch a bitches getting low, pimpin'? You already know\nI'm 'bout to get up on the flow and then bring the chicken to my crib\nGetting drunk up in this muthafucka, fuck you think this is?\nThen I see a bad bitch with a booty and a half\nI make a move on that cutie, \"Excuse me, do you wanna dance?\"\nThen she looked at me and laughed like I didn't have a chance\nLike I shouldn't even ask, so I proceeded to get trashed\nThen I'm at the bar now and it's so loud, but I'm takin' shots and I'm throwin down\nAnd I see a pretty lady, so I send her some of that cold brown\nAnd she turned around, and then turned it down\nBecause in her words, she \"Don't like to flirt with clowns\"\nAnd I'm alone and pouting, overcrowded, I need to get up out this club\n\n[Chorus]\nI been inside this club for way too long\nI wanna leave and eat calzones\nNone of these females wanna bone\nMy self esteem is all but gone\n\n[Verse 2]\n'Bout to quit, but I'm bitter I paid that cover\nSo I guess I gotta stay in this stupid club a bit longer\nAnd I'm sweating like a jew in a multicultural sauna\nThey been playing fuckin' dubstep for ten consecutive songs\nAnd then I bumped into a guy, he was roughly six-foot-five\nPretty sure it was his fault, but I apologized\nPretty sure you know the type, probly bankin' every night\nVodka sprite, lookin' round to find a kike that he can fight\nOr suckerpunch, I'm kinda drunk, and I been up in the club for way too long\nNow I'm up in the corner, all alone, ESPN up on my phone\nMy self esteem is so depleted, such a mess, I'm overheated\nI regretfully just tweeted some depressing shit, I need to leave this club\n\n[Chorus]\nI been inside this club for way too long\nI wanna leave and eat calzones\nNone of these females wanna bone\nMy self esteem is all but gone\n\n[Verse 3]\nIs this really for the bathroom, are you kidding?\nThis the type of line where people squeeze they dick to prevent pissing\nWhen I get inside the stall it's like a yeti had been shitting\nMan, there's piss all on the ground, so as I'm wizzing I keep slipping\nFuck this hand stamp, club is really damn cramped\nFuck it, I'ma suck it up and take another damn chance\nUghh, here goes nothing (c'mon D)\n\"Ayy girlie, what's the word? At first glance I may look like a nerd\nBut if you let me, bet D, get thee all up in the bed so wet like a mafuckin' jet ski\nReal rap if you tryna go, then put your name right here up inside my phone\nShe took bait, no way, typing out her home, she pressed save\nWalked away, and her name was no?\n\n[Post-Verse]\nNo? She wrote no and no number. She just wrote the word no. Ooh, I get it. She's a bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nI been inside this club for way too long\nI wanna leave and eat calzones\nNone of these females wanna bone\nMy self esteem is all but gone\n\n[Outro]\nFuck this club, man. I knew I shouldn't have worn this shirt. Or at least I should've buttoned the top two buttons. My chest hair poking out, looking like taco meat. So Hard."

Goddamn. Das a misinterpreta-tion\nHate it when they stiff. Over-tipping 'cause I'm cak-ing\n\nTake in errything a mafucka say\nBeen about rap, figured out that from the basement\nI ain't talkin bout rap city on black entertainment\nTalkin bout the place I was raised in\nPlate full uh bacon\nMaking a bagel and bake on occasion\n\nBack then woulda made rap for grades\nNow a mafucka make rap for pay\nAnd them bitches too\nChickens that I'm bangin' so appealing\nThey been Shagging on ma balls, like they practicing they fielding and\nI Sorta make 'em pop off\nMake 'em take they socks off\nRound the fuckin' bases then get pounded like a walk off\n\nAw naw...\nThis a fucking statement I'm making\nThey been hesitating to give Lil David space at the table\n'cause they label a capable able Jew gay and too playful\nWatching cable naked, the AC blowin' major like Slater's dad\n\nWhy you hater's mad?\nMaybe I should get a couple tats\nMaybe I should get in trouble and be dumbin' down the rap\nLook at Mac\nWhite as fuck but lookin' thugger than a trap spot\nNeed another mac 'stead of luggin' round this laptop\n\nBlackballed\nFrom the muthafuckin' rap blogs\n'cause I rap odd, never talkin' bout a fuckin' black card\nIon't gotta play da black card, 'cause I rap hard\nIon't think it mean I gotta act hard\n\nFuck it tho\nDespite dat LD straight fucking hoes\nMa chickens stay hot, no buffalo\nMa hand been up in her bod, no Muppet ho\n\nWhatcha know bout a mafuckin' kid up wit a job\nCoulda fit in wit the mob, had a kid and a garage\nBut I didn't now I'm spittin' like a mothafuckin' slob\nDoin' shit up in garageband, better than the gods of the game do\n\nY'all better know ma name soon\nI ain't no clown, when you laughin' out loud\nDon't forget you getting down to a great tune\n\nMake room\nI'm coming for you muthafuckin rappers spittin' dog shit\nYeah I'm fuckin' funny, but this muthafuckin' dog spit\nAw shit...I could write a TV show tomorrow\nBut before I get dat Emmy I'ma make you bitches sorry that I'm gone\n\n[Outro:Lil Dicky]\nYeah, and once again no disrespect to Mac, Mac I actually follow you on Vine, I'm fucking with you, it looks like your having a pretty ridiculous amount of fun,\nSometimes your at a pool, sometimes your smoking weed and rapping\nWould love to be a part of it,if vine is any indicator your life is awesome\nOkay I got to go to work, see ya"

I can barely slug a half a dozen tops\nUsed to chug a lot, now I'm fuckin buzzin off a shot whoa\n\nClubbin wasn't nuffin to me boy\nUsed to walk up in that muthafucka stuntin like whassup, I wadn't coy\nAin't nobody gave a fuck if I'm employed\n\nErrybody drunk and fuckin lovin it, rubbin, and huggin\nMugging, chugging and fuckin but now these bitches\nIs up on some other shit, wanting a husband\nClubbin got me buggin and blushing cuz I'ma young'n das confronted\nWit a hundred abundantly rugged, and coveted, funded muthafuckas, it's humbling\n\nThink about the age range\nThey get to date way older and emotionally open homies goin gray\nNow I'm up on first dates\nSober like it's first grade\nHoping when it's over that I close it wit some first base shit\n\nMa face getting fuckin fat\nIt's April, hay fool fill your fuckin taxes out\n\nLong ass days, getting blazed, and tappin out\nBack is naggin now, mac is laggin now\n\nBecause I bought it back in college\nSo if you comin lemme run a little knowledge\nIf you was wondering if fun isn't acknowledged\nWell Wednesdays, I be watching workaholics"

   "lyrics": "If you have been involved in a motor vehicle accident, it is likely that you\u2005are\u2005confused as to\u2005what your next course of action\u2005should be. This is very common in that when in a motor vehicle accident takes place, the parties thereto are initially in a state of shock. However, once that shock wears off, they begin to question what their next steps should be.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the parties to a motor vehicle accident are not in the state of mind to make any decisions or any statements. It is very common that the most important thing to the parties is their physical well-being and condition of their vehicles. Once the shock and the adrenaline has worn off, the parties are able to think clearly and that is the time to consult with and retain a Los Angeles accident attorney.\n\nThere are several reasons to retain an auto injury attorney. First is that the car accident personal injury lawyer is trained in handling the immediate next steps following a motor vehicle accident. Most often, these immediate next steps are filing a claim with the insurance carrier for the offending vehicle and filing a claim with your insurance carrier so that your medical expenses can be paid.\n\nBy and large, the parties to motor vehicle accidents are not in the frame of mind post-accident to deal with the numerous factors that are required of personal injury plaintiffs. Negotiating with insurance carriers, sending photographs, making witness statements and dealing with medical billing companies are not matters that injured parties should be concerned with. The reason for this is that an injured plaintiff has enough on their hands in terms of dealing with the recovery from the serious and possibly permanent personal injuries they sustained in the accident.\n\nRecuperation from personal injuries can be very time-consuming depending upon their nature and extent. It is likely that an injured plaintiff will need to treat with their physician 3-4 times a week if not more. Chiropractic care, physical therapy and diagnostic testing are all routine courses of care that should be sought by personal entry plaintiffs immediately following their accident.\n\nThis leaves very little time for plaintiffs to take phone calls from insurance carriers and handle medical billing claims. Such matters are best left to a car accident personal injury lawyer since they are better prepared to handle such matters.\n\nTherefore, the immediate two steps following a motor vehicle accident should be to consult with and retain a Los Angeles accident attorney, file a claim with the offending vehicle\u2019s insurance carrier and file a claim with your own insurance carrier so that your medical benefits will be paid.\n\nBeyond these main initial three steps, you should gather all of your relevant insurance documentation such as the declaration page for the policy insurance that covered your vehicle on the date of the accident. If you have photographs of your vehicle or your injuries, they should be printed and provided to your attorney on the date of your initial consultation or within at least a few days thereafter. These documents are vital to your auto injury attorney so that he or she may best advocate your case during the course of time they are negotiating with the insurance carrier for the defendant or their attorneys if your case needs to be litigated.\n\nYour auto injury attorney will file your claim with the offending vehicle\u2019s insurance carrier and attempt to settle your case before filing a lawsuit. However, if your case is ubable to be settled for a fair amount, your attorney will seek damages by filing a lawsuit in a Court of competent jurisdiction. This means that your case will be assigned a presiding judge and that the offending vehicle will retain counsel to defend the case.\n\nIn every motor vehicle accident case, there are two main aspects: liability and damages. Liability is where the question is asked \u201cwho is responsible?\u201d. Depending upon the type of accident you had, liability maybe clear-cut (hit in the rear accident) or it may be disputed (left turn in front, broadside hit, T-bone accident). These are matters for your Los Angeles accident attorney to determine only after a full evaluation of your case.\n\nAs for damages, permanency is the key to the kingdom. If you have sustained permanent injuries, your case will be evaluated favorably and you will be paid for your pain and suffering. You are also entitled to compensation for lost wages and future medical treatment. Your attorney will put together a \u201cspecials\u201d package that will make a demand upon the insurance carrier for the defendant based upon your theory of liability and the damages you sustained as a result of the accident.\n\nIt is for these reasons that you should immediately consult with and retain an experienced personal injury attorney if you have been involved in a motor vehicle accident. Your attorney will be able to recommend a skilled chiropractor and physical therapist so that you may begin to rehabilitate from your injuries. If you have a physician that you have been treating with your entire life, it is recommended that you schedule an appointment to be examined by that physician.\n\nTake the immediate steps following your motor vehicle accident seriously since every decision you make will have far-reaching effects. If you have injuries at the time of the accident and are not feeling like yourself, do not decline medical treatment-have the ambulance take you to the emergency room so that you can be checked out. If you do not, the insurance carrier for the defendant will certainly hold this against you for as long as your case is pending. They will invariably say \u201cif the plaintiff was that injured they would\u2019ve gone to the emergency room\u201d. This is a common rebuttal asserted by the defendant\u2019s insurance carrier.\n\nThis is only one example of how crucial each decision you make is during the pendency of your case.\n\nWith that in mind, once you have settled down post-accident, contact an experienced person injury attorney and consult with them so you may take the first step toward rehabilitation, recuperation and receiving compensation for the damages you sustained in your accident."

   "lyrics": "How does it feel when employers don\u2019t pay their employees despite putting relentless efforts in their job duties? Working for 8 or more hours a day is hectic but it\u2019s quite frustrating when employees don\u2019t get pay for that. It\u2019s a law in California that the non-exempt employees have to be given minimum wages, overtime wages, and wages of accrued vacation by their employers. If the employers fail to pay the due wages on time, they can be sued by the employees.\n\nHowever, workers should consult with overtime attorneys for legal advice. In this context, it\u2019s important to know the steps that the employees can take if their employers refuse to pay overtime wages.\nFirst of all, employees can resign from the job without any notice and then take a legal action against the employer. If employees are wondering that how do I write my two weeks notice need to understand that in wage and hour violations, no employee is bound to give any notice! Besides this, there\u2019s no compulsion in California to submit an advanced notice of two weeks. This is because employment in California works on an at-will basis.\n\nCalifornia has stringent protection laws directed for employment protection. One such law is the protection of the employee from employer retaliation due to filing of a lawsuit against them.\n\nWhat is the overtime wage violation?\nBefore proceeding with the other steps, one should know what overtime wage violation means in California. The maximum time of work is 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week in California. If an employee is made to work for more than 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week; the employer should pay for that. Failure to pay overtime wages is a violation of the California Wage and Hour Laws. Employees should seek professional help for overtime wage violation in:\n\n\u2022\tOvertime violations\n\u2022\tMisclassification of employees as independent contractors\n\u2022\tIncorrect breaks\n\u2022\tDenial of paying commissions\n\u2022\tMiscalculation of wages\n\nHowever, an exempt employee cannot make any claims or file a lawsuit because the California law doesn\u2019t entitle them to minimum wages or overtime wages. Exempt employees are salaried persons and they are the ones involved in executive, administrative and managerial tasks. So if employees are denied overtime wages, they can file a lawsuit against the employer.\n\nMiscalculation of wages/Commissions:\nAt times, employers often miscalculate wages. If a worker feels that the wages have been miscalculated should seek professional help from an attorney. They can calculate the wages and commissions and will be able to tell if it is correct to file a lawsuit. They can suggest alternative options to sort out the matter with the employers- for example, front to front discussion with the employer. However, if none of the solutions work, then filing a lawsuit would be the last resort.\n\nMissed meal and rest breaks\nEvery company should offer meal and rest breaks to the employees. Under the California and federal laws, all the non-exempt employees are entitled to uninterrupted rest and meal breaks. However, if the employer makes the employee work even during the break periods, then it will be considered as a violation of the labor laws.\nIt\u2019s important for the workers to seek professional help from attorneys if they\u2019ve been denied the overtime wages."

   "lyrics": "Different types of torque wrenches deliver different amounts of torque. There are two main types\u2005of\u2005torque wrenches used\u2005in auto repair: manual and pneumatic\u2005wrenches. Within these, there are some subcategories. For all these\u205fkeys,\u205fkeep\u205fin mind that\u205fit is essential\u205fto take proper care of them and calibrate them regularly to keep them working properly. No matter what type of torque wrench you ultimately choose, be sure to buy a torque wrench that meets your specific needs. To facilitate your buying, visit this website and get a perfect idea on different types of torque-wrenches available in the market. Compare the best models and know all the details.\n\nWhat is a toruqe-wrench?\nIt is a wrench that indicates the torque that is being exercised with it. A function not only useful, but necessary: if you want to do mechanical work with precision. Most screws in a car should be tightened with the force indicated by the manufacturer. Turning more vigorously than you can can damage parts that would fail to do their job properly. The tightening torque is indicated in the manufacturer's workshop manual, although information on each model is circulated in various specialized forums.\n\nFew basic aspects to know\nDepending on the type of key, it will work in one way or another. If it is a mechanical jump key, it will simply \u201cjump\u201d when we reach the pair that we have selected. On the other hand, if it is a digital torque wrench, it will emit a sound or a vibration when we reach that point. There are also torque wrenches, which mark the torque using a needle.\n\nSelect the pair \u2013Choose the necessary torque for the screw in question. On mechanical jump wrenches, it is done by turning a thread until the gauge is where you need to be. In the thread there is also a kind of ruler, which will allow you to tune more.\n\nSlow movements \u2013Torque wrenches should be turned slowly and steadily. This is how they work with their maximum accuracy.\n\nFor as soon as the indicator jumps \u2013On the jump keys a clack will sound when it reaches the correct pair. On the digital keys it will beep. When that time comes you should immediately stop squeezing.\nDo not use it in the opposite direction \u2013If you use a wrench of this type to loosen instead of tightening, the most normal thing is that you end up miscalibrating . This means that it will no longer offer a correct torque measurement.\n\nOpinions and final conclusions\nThere are professional torque wrenches with great precision and a very wide range of torque measurements. However, its price can be 10 or 15 times higher than the most mundane keys. If you are going to do mechanical work, it is better to get two different wrenches to cover a range of Nm wide enough. Your investment will be much less than if you bought a professional key. The torque wrench provides the necessary precision for mechanics."
