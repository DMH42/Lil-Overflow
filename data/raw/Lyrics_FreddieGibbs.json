  "plain": "Freddie Gibbs is a talented underground midwest gangsta rapper from the city of Gary, Indiana. He has been dropping mixtapes since 2003 till now. His first solo studio album was entitled ESGN (Evil Seeds Grow Naturally) dropped 10 years after he started rapping.\n\nThe year after that he then released Pi\u00f1ata or \u201cCocaine Pi\u00f1ata\u201d along with legendary producer Madlib. The album has been recognized as a classic to even doubters of Freddie Gibbs' skill. A second collaborative album, Bandana was released five years later to widespread critical acclaim. Whilst he did gain a lot of clout off these collaborative albums, he was prior to this release already on GTA 5 with 2 songs on Los Santos Radio station, \u201cStill Livin\u201d from the Baby Face Killa mixtape (2012), \u201cSmoking & Riding\u201d a GTA original with BJ The Chicago Kid. \u2018Sellin\u2019 Dope\", a track with Mike Dean, was added to the enhanced re-release of the game."

interstate with some gorilla weight\nShit that can get me like 200 years\nDuckin' the pen', I need forgiveness\nI'm livin' like a every decision a sin\nI know my niggas don't want me to win\nJealousy, choppin' off all of my friends\n\n[Chorus]\nI ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in\nVVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen\nTricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian\nSpent my last 200 thou' on a bird and a Mercedes Benz\nMy dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300\nFresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?\nFirst these hoes ain't want it\nNow they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)\nMama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I-I-I-I be kickin' shit like Solange in the

wrote\nThese hoes get in your ear and burn that ass quick like Galaxy Notes\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in\nVVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus

I can taste it\"\nPut em on their faces: what you know about kidnapping\nAnd holding a nigga's whole family for ransom?\nWhen your stomach empty it's easy to understand it\nGot me out here taking them penitentiary chances\n\"Born in this world of tears, will die laughing\"\nPut that on the headpiece right above my casket\nStill in the game, my batteries still lastin\nBout to put some gas up in my Caprice Classic, and...\n\nRob me a nigga\nRob me a, rob me a nigga\nBills too high, this nigga right here too fly\nRight now I just might rob me a nigga\n\n[Verse 2 - Alley Boy]\nAs I look at the charm, thinking of a strong arm\nSeen his watch as he reachin for his car alarm\nBet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice\nFore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come\nAll they seen was my golds and a black mask\nThrow the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags\nAll these niggas wanna flash, Ima put it to they ass\nWith the K out, ask a nigga, \u201cWhere da sack at?\"\nGive it here, you wanna die for that rolex?\nYou can either get your life or that watch back\nIma shoot you point blank, I\u2019m just hoping you think\nYou can take it as a loss, you can get it back\nNigga, buck and get shot, that\u2019s the street code\nI\u2019m leave you there, do you, that\u2019s how the shit go\nJust another episode, A-K explode\nIn his head, left a smoke hole\nBe a shamed if you died over fake shit\nBut that\u2019s a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit\nCome and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry\nThey be murkin for a quarter brick\nKnow they kill a whole fam for the whole thang\nAll the shooters up in Gary on the same thang\nAll the little homies strapped, so they look plain\nGun shots rang out, nigga, see flames\nWe be takin so much, now the shit fun\nWe be lookin for your shit fore your shit come\nForty eight hours, nigga round my way\nEveryday nigga lookin like a sitcom\nIn this game of lose or draw nigga\nYou can be the one that get robbed\nOr be the one to rob a nigga\nBut we all gotta eat, so we get no sleep\nWe gon wait it out and kill a nigga"

Swallow forced beliefs like police justice\nIf my city is like yours\nThen serials scratched, fingerprints is wiped off\nIf people seem to always have somethin' to fight for\nBut still end up in the state pen or the psych ward, it's lights off\nThey catch so many casualties, it's like war\nThat's the reason I don't believe in the hype y'all\nThe devil talkin' 'bout he wanna extradite y'all\nNow I'm the nigga they shinin' the searchlight for\n\n[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]\nYeah, nigga\nAnd if the devil die today, I'ma treat it like it's a holiday\nYeah, yeah\n'Bout to Michael Jackson, beat it, I mean it, I got a pot of yay\nNigga, what, haha\nAnd nothin' funny, but I play with the money like it's Monopoly\nYeah, yeah, bitch\nAnd if the devil die today, I'ma treat it like it's a holiday\n\n[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs]\nYeah, yeah, uh\nHere we come, yeah, here we come, yeah (Yeah, nigga)\nHere we come, yeah, here we come, yeah\nHere we come, yeah, here we come, yeah (Yeah, freestyle nigga)\n\n[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]\nHomie showed me a nine milli and nine nickel\nMan, I'll stay on point like icicle\nSay you got that yola, your fishscale lookin' fickle\nThey like Jordans out of the gas station, they ain't official\nI got thousand dollar jeans on my ass cheek\nCousin got her lights and her gas cut last week\nHow that make me look if I don't help her get up on her feet?\nShe keep a different nigga, now she in there pregnant every week\nI pray you take these devils out our life, Lord, that's on Vice Lord\nBaby mamas come with their drama, made her my wife, Lord\nKnow I'm doing, no hope, you see I'm trying to do right, Lord\nShake 'em up and blowin' the dice, I pray the price, Lord, Lord\n\n[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]\nYeah, nigga\nAnd if the devil die today, I'ma treat it like it's a holiday\nYeah, yeah\n'Bout to Michael Jackson, beat it, I mean it, I got a pot of yay\nNigga, what, haha\nAnd nothin' funny, but I play with the money like it's Monopoly\nYeah, yeah, bitch\nAnd if the devil die today, I'ma treat it like it's a holiday\n\n[Verse 4: Black Thought]\nYo, my memoirs are like the Anarchist's Cookbook\nMeets the Tom Ford spring/summer look book\nSome people wanna see me hanging from a good hook\nInstead I hang with a language and slang in\nThe anguish and pain fit as well cause it came with us\nAfter all these years carrying this shame with us\nNow the entire planet is going insane with us\nSeven year old kids carrying flame spitters\nFortified fences, mortify senses\nCrossfire missed my little daughter by inches\nChemical dependence, medical expenses\nBut no amount of money on earth can buy vengeance\nWriting a life sentence, sirens, fire engines\nTyrants seen through the eyes of the wide lenses\nSenseless crimes cause some of us want to drive Benzes\nBut are you tryna ride with us or against us?\n\n[Outro: Louis Farrakhan]\nAs long as they kill us\nAnd go to Wendy\u2019s and have a burger and go to sleep\nThey gon' keep killing us\nBut when we die and they die\nThen soon we gon' sit at a table, and talk about it, we tired\nWe want some of this earth\nOr we'll tear this goddamn country apart!\nAssalam ualaikum!"

I been around the block and back again\nNo reruns, but I'm letting 'em know what's happening\nWhen I wake up I'm on my hustle, getting scratch again\nHoping and praying I don't go back to slinging crack again\nDon't think cause I'm rapping that I won't bust a gat again\nPut one in your body, have all of your bones shattering\nSo tell your homies I ain't with the tounge wrestling\nHe gon' fuck with me and end up murdered in that 'llac he in\nThis ain't a game, why you niggas think I'm playing with ya?\nSit back and let me paint this lyrical picture\nI done seen true friends turn into true foes\nAnd these so-called real niggas turn into real hoes\nWhen these niggas get exposed they don't talk, they just walk right past ya\nLeaving me no choice but to blast ya\nMan all I'm tryin to do is feed my people\nYou don't want me busting the Desert Eagle\nI don't fear no evil\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis a stick-up nigga, I ain't playing with your bitch ass\nI'm coming for the work and the cash in your stizzash\nI scoop up the goodies and then I'm gone in a flizzash\nI'm outta town before the word spread like a rizzash\nHate it or love it, man, that's how shit go\nI sit and think about my future while I'm puffing the dro\nHell yeah, I plan on getting riches off my flow\nIf it don't work, I found another way to get my dough\nCause this rap shit is like a popularity contest\nIt's time to give the props to the niggas that rhyme best\nA lot of niggas might take this shit outta context\nHaters can't understand it cause the flow so complex\nI hit the weed and leave my pain in the ashtray\nFuck a 9 to 5 I'mma get mine the fast way\nThe ski mask way\nThe only way I know to get it\nOh I can hit the booth and spit it the way I know to spit it, Gangsta\n\n[Hook]"

I ain't going out like no punk shit\nCar accidents, terminal illness\nDeath is something you gotta deal with\nRest in peace to my homies; the lord called them home\nQuay Shepard, Andrew Jones, and Little Ramon\nYou're gonna live through the kid\nSo, I'll never forget you\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "(Intro)\n(You know) A lot of niggas be thinking I be talking about them in my raps and shit (Yeah, nigga)\nProbably cause I do, nigga\n\n(verse 1)\nMy sentiments exactly, niggas can't out rap me\nAnd if they could, they already dead or they hip-hop hall-of-famers\nDon't run up if you ain't got a whole catalog of bangers\nGary gangsta, guess I'm no longer a stranger\nBitch I get love out on the West Coast like I ball for Lakers\nAsk my nigga Syke, fuck the proof, I'm where the drugs was\nHit the streets with nothing but troops, slaughter your buzz, cuz\nThuggin', I don't be bloggin' like Budden, I just speak through the songs\nFigure the only reason that you was on, cause you's a clone\nMoving right along, we all wrong, but all's well\nSlamming off the phone and chopping stones, we all sell\nSometimes I had work on deck, and sometimes I 9-to-5-ed it\nDo more than boast about balling, I rhyme about surviving\nGetting it in every city I ever lived\nSouth Central to ATL and over the Brooklyn Bridge\nI hit the G and watch them shipping that weight\nServing plates, whipping with my nigga Dominican H\nI need some cash, I know you trying to get straight, so fuck with me dawg\nThem other niggas slamming that bammer, they need a recall\nGot choppers, fuck binoculars, nigga we come to see y'all\nDon't matter if you V, or GD, or C or a B-Dawg\nThe topics from the prophet prevail\nEast-side G.I. 'til I get dropped or I get locked in a cell\nMy nigga Pill said, \"I can't afford to take that L.\"\nSo he lickin shots at the fucking laws\nI call 'em Johnnies (fuck the police), he like to call em twelve\nFuck the polices and rest in peace, to my nigga Stymie\nPigs killed him front of his family, that shit was grimey\nThat's why everywhere I go I keep a Ruger beside me\nCut the fat from the clique, got them bitch niggas way from 'round me\nThat's how they do you, act like they never knew you\nHo I see right through you, what you eatin' don't make me doo-doo\nAnd if I ain't gon' shit, I might as well jump off the pot\nMighty dollar say I might as well pull a plot on your spot\nI'm trying to clock a knot, pushing as quickly as possible\nHad to be Gangsta Gibbs, wasn't gifted like Glenn Robinson\nAverage hoop skills, but I ride up on coupe wheels\nCustom convertible Cutlass, how you and you crew feel\nWhen you see that? You probably wanna do that just like me\nI set the bar for I-N-D, no nigga don't rap like me\nYou want that killer not that filler, then fuck with yo' boy Fred\nMalcolm of the Mid, probably more like Detroit Red\nAnd I can easily bring you defeat with my vernacular\nI'm too deep in these streets to be beefing with a rapper\nI got niggas that hate me, bitches that love me\nHands do damage so I manage to stay handsome when shit could get ugly\nNow every nigga rhyming think he a mob boss\nBetter keep it tucked cause pups get fucked like Shad Moss\nNiggas was puffing that huff 'til I sent a few quads off\nShot my nigga some kush and couple of zips of that bomb soft\nAttracting addicts, when I pick them beats I be selecting Statik\nRap ain't nothing but talking shit; I'm just the best at it\nAt every stage show, I'm puffin that tree\nBeen putting it down since '03, but y'all wasn't fuckin with me\nI threw my tape out on the streets and watched my tape lift off\nWith out a verse from Weezy, Kanye or the fake Rick Ross\nFuck a cosign, I hold mine close to the hip\nCrushin' feelin's, leaving niggas on some emotional shit\nGangsta Gibbs\n\n(Outro)\nAnd I love the rap game (We love it, baby)\nI love to see niggas getting, you know (Getting money, nigga)\nGet shit cracking, gettin shit popping, you know what I mean\nTime to bring that money to the motherfucking G, nigga\nMotherfuckers been doing this shit for years\nIt's time for them motherfuckers to be getting in this thang, baby\nAnd if you ain't from G, nigga, don't come to the G\nCause you ain't gon' understand the G\nYou gon' be laying in the G\nShoutout to all my niggas in the G, nigga"

muthafuckin' food on the table\nThat's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able\nTo get up some bread for the rent, lights, and cable\nThe gas and water\nShe actin like I'm tryna starve her\nAnd I know the baby growin' and her belly gotta eat too\nOnly thing I got left is this gun on my belt, If I can't feed myself how I'mma feed you?\nHow I'mma ride with this tank on empty, sellin yola hoping that the jakes dont get me\nCause when I leave the crib man that thang go wit' me\nMy nigga from the jets got stained for a 50\nSack of the hard\nTryna match you a broad\nGot 'em shot up in his car by a muthafuckin' dope fiend\nA bitch tryna get a fix, put my nigga in a ditch, we been hittin them licks since we was 14\nNow they say you in a calmer place\nI couldn't tell by the looks on yo' momma face\nNow everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace\nShe disappointed by the dreams we was lookin' to chase\nCause we was cookin' the base and we was flippin' the spinach\nAnd if a nigga violated then we handled our business\nWe never knew one day the street shit would catch up with us\nAnd I don't roll with many niggas, you was one of the realest\nI'm like\n\n[Hook]\nDamn, it can't

problems\nI'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man\nSometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man\n\n[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]\nDamn, open my mailbox and all I get to see is bill after bill\nShit kinda slow ain't no real money be comin' in but yo, I still got ten on the kil'\nTen on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison\nMy nigga Rich doin' a bid they sent the boys in, to get him if I would've been wit' him I woulda joined him\nAnd now I'm out here lurkin' the streets wit' no work feelin' like my throat been cut wit' no plug\nYou know just what I mean if you ever done sold drugs, finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love\nAnd I ain't got no qualification for no career move, people up in corporate America probably fear dude\nGettin' shine off of my rhyme for like a year or two, still got the police lights up in my rearview\nDamn, as I sit behind a tint, in a car full of smoke\nHopin' this officer don't do nothin' to make me have to hurt him cause it's over if I get caught up with this dope\nGive me a coal, might as well hang me from a rope\nCause the government lynchin' niggas more than ever before\nSort of like the slavery days but if we're afraid to change\nThen how the fuck is we supposed to grow?\nThey got a nigga like damn..\n\n[Hook]\nDamn, it can't get no worse than this cause I done hit rock bottom\nI'mma get up on a muthafuckin' sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems\nI'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man\nSometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man\nDamn, it can't get no worse than this cause I done hit rock bottom\nI'mma get up on a muthafuckin' sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems\nI'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man\nSometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man"

I'm trading bullets with the opposition, definitely Destined for prison\nOr the grave, I need to get my life together\nA new age slave, man I can\u2019t live like this forever\nAnd yeah it\u2019s a shame, because I know can do better, then holding loaded Birettas\nReady for whatever to get the chedda' nigga!\nIt\u2019s the same from your hood to my blocks\n\n[Hook]\nI wake up in the morning to the sounds of gunshots\nAnd I can\u2019t sleep, living with beef and police\nI'm just caught up in the cycle, stuck in the streets\nI said the ghetto is the same from your hood to my blocks\nI wake up in the morning to the sounds of gunshots\nAnd I can\u2019t sleep, living with beef and police\nI'm just caught up in the cycle, stuck in the streets\nWhen will I ever wake up?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDamn, I'm back in these handcuffs\nOfficer pulled me over said, get out with my hands up\nBut livin' in Gary, on the daily we get harassed by police\nGot narcotics in my pocket, and my heat under the seat\nI ain't fucking with nobody just tryna' get on my feet\nBeen unemployed for weeks, so this is how I gotta eat\nA lotta' people say I'm just another waste of a black mind\nHustling on the same grind, killing my own kind\nPut my life on the line for a couple of bucks\nYou considered the risk I'm taking this don't pay me enough\nHaving babies with different ladies, living life in a rush\nThe truth is, I don't give no fuck!\nWhen will I ever wake up?\nOr will just end up another statistic?\nJust a number to the government?\nStuck in the system maine!\nThis shit will make you go insane\nEveryday, I'm losing homies in this muthafuckin' game\nAnd the ghetto is the same from your hood to my blocks\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, blame the system, they blame it on hip hop\nThe content of my lyrics, got these young niggas brainwashed\nBut I got out the streets to do this shit for a livin'\nAs rappers we should pay attention to the message we sending\nI ain't trippin', go get your money because I'm tryna' get mine\nBut I know niggas that will sell they fucking souls to shine!\nI swear the business ain't appealing to me!\nThere is niggas dying over petty ass industry beef\nI must admit sometimes I spit and think my label don't really know what to do with me\nAnd I be broke, before them crackers make a fool of me\nBefore I be a puppet, they be reading my eulogy\nMy music a reflection of my community\nSo nigga wake up!\nLead us away from the devil\nLord show us a sign\nPut up your metal, your ghetto ain't no harder than mine\nAnd it's a muthafuckin' shame, everyday I'm losing homies in this muthafuckin' game!\nAnd the ghetto is the same from your hood to my blocks\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nUh, When will I ever wake up?\nYeah, When will I ever wake up?\nYeah\nWhen will I ever wake up?\nI said the ghetto is the same from your hood to my blocks\nI wake up in the morning to the sounds of gunshots\nWhen will I wake up?\nWhen will I ever wake up?\nWhen will I ever wake up?"

Fleezy]\nLike when you feeling good, cause bitch I feel so right\nLike moving out my body, purple paint and fanta got me tight\nI introduce you to my life, come take a look inside\nBitch, wipe your feet and wipe me down, bitch we don't play around\nI'm [?]\nHow you stay focused and function, bitch we gon' blaze a pound\nSo when the last time you heard that, yeah we really made for this\nSo go and send the word back\nRight about now, time to tally up a staple\nGot them ready, willing, able\nMolly-popping, make 'em get down on the floor with the business\nAnd they live for the getting it\nPlayer, out here with it, and that's me\nThe real player with a G\n\n[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]"

Meet me half way\nBreak 'em down and move a couple bands on the bad day\nMight not rap forever so I'm thuggin' 'til my last day\nBitch I said the world is my motherfuckin' ashtray\nNiggas got them zones, quarters, halves, meet me half way\nBreak 'em down and move a couple bands on the bad day\nMight not rap forever so I'm thuggin', like it's my last day\nMotherfuckin' Gibbs"

   "lyrics": "(Ozzy Osbourne)\nClose your eyes\nClose your eyes\nYou gotta close your eyes for me\n\n(Freddie Gibbs)\nYeah\nKeep 'em closed\nHaha, yeah\n\n(Verse 1)\nImagine this, livin' in a spot without a pot piss\nOr no windows to open up so you can pour out the shit\nLivin' dead cause you ain't really livin' without a grip\nHella shit to pay, baby on the way ain't that bout a bitch\nIt's 1982, she gave birth to you and dropped outta college\nRaised you in the Atlas but full of addicts and alcoholics\nNo place to live, yo momma and her momma crib\nNo paper for labor, her pockets broke before her water did\nNot just a ghetto kid, she was a survivor\nMum a hard working women but daddy's a womanizer\nSaw him cheat her and beat her then leave her like he despised her\nSo when you grew up to be that way it didn't suprise her\nThe thug in your blood, she love you but can't control you\nConditions that you livin' are starting to shape and mold you\nShe say the devil in your head\nHe introduce you to the streets, yo my name is Fred\nI'm in it til my coffin close\n\n(Hook)\n(Close your eyes)\nCan you imagine that?\n(Close your eyes)\nSit back and blaze a sack\n(You gotta close your eyes for me)\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nAlways lay down with my heat\nGotta jump back on my feet\nI'm in the street, until my coffin close\n\n(Close your eyes)\nCan you imagine that?\n(Close your eyes)\nNigga, sit back and blaze a sack\n(You gotta close your eyes for me)\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nAlways lay down with my heat\nGotta jump back on my feet\nI'm in the street, until my coffin close\n\n(Verse 2)\nYeah\nStreets cold, these youngin' niggas is gettin' bold\nMurder on the daily this funeral shit is gettin' old\nYa soul searchin' for another way to make it through\nCollege, military, that 9 to 5 shit don't work for you\nSo what you do? Load another clip, we plot another lick\nYou got a thing for music and your homies like the way you spit\nThe lords showin' you a sign you can't ignore the shit\nPut your pain on paper, hit the lab and go record the shit\nYour fan base is gettin' big\nThis Jewish kid from California working your label now you got this cracker on your dick\nTold his boss the Judas shit and everybody feelin' him\nHe took advantage of your thirst and signed you for the minimum\nThe rap stopped sellin' and he started acting funny\nYour manager just managed a way to jerk you for your money\nBut them crackers said they had your back\nYou got a record deal so why you back to sellin' crack?\nThey wanna see your coffin close\n\n(Hook)\n(Close your eyes)\nCan you imagine that?\n(Close your eyes)\nSit back and blaze a sack\n(You gotta close your eyes for me)\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nAlways lay down with my heat\nGotta jump back on my feet\nI'm in the street, until my coffin close\n\n(Close your eyes)\nCan you imagine that?\n(Close your eyes)\nNigga, sit back and blaze a sack\n(You gotta close your eyes for me)\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nAlways lay down with my heat\nGotta jump back on my feet\nI'm in the street, until my coffin close\n\n(Verse 3)\nYeah\nYou right back where you started, careless and broken hearted\nOne shot away from being part of the dearly departed\nThese haters bustin' choppers at you so you bustin' back\nThat rapping dream you had that's out the window, you like fuck that\nYour girl says she pregnant\nYour grandma just passed away\nYour homie took one in the head\nYour cousin just got murked today\nPsychologically this shit done sent you on a rampage\nNiggas look at you wrong and you bustin' off that 12 gauge\nAll you do is hell raise\nLet that bottle solve your problems\nLiquor with the pills, codeine, Xanax, and OxyContin\nDrug habit off the hook\nStep away from snorting powder\nParanoia waking you up out your sleep like every hour\nThis is not a movie cause every day niggas get devoured\nBy the street, losing they life, they enticed by money and power\nUntil the game bring a nigga to the end\nI just pray the lord forgive me for my sins\n\n(Hook)\n(Close your eyes)\nCan you imagine that?\n(Close your eyes)\nSit back and blaze a sack\n(You gotta close your eyes for me)\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nAlways lay down with my heat\nGotta jump back on my feet\nI'm in the street, until my coffin close\n\n(Close your eyes)\nCan you imagine that?\n(Close your eyes)\nNigga, sit back and blaze a sack\n(You gotta close your eyes for me)\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nAlways lay down with my heat\nGotta jump back on my feet\nI'm in the street, until my coffin close"

   "lyrics": "Yeah, yeah, I'm high upon a new wave of confidence\nI'm trying to ride it to a few different continents\nKnown in the country that I'm from but anonymous\nTo most of the populous and dominant\nAwkward places, I'm from New Zealand and I'm use to seeing different faces\nAnd they don't ever turn the radio to different stations\nI gotta do it though cause Mum's getting sick of waiting\nWhen I was young she used to tell me \"Have some f*cking patience\"\nBut she loved the baby boy, raise the bar like I'm on roids with my game playing with the joysticks\nI'm grateful for the voice I've been given\nBig boy now my purple whip about to have all of the sort of bugs flicking\nSippin' vodka soda with the twist in\nI don't say it should be different it's still hip hop in the vein\nSmurnoff in the brain, always been a cool dude I'll let you know if you can say\nI'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday\nAin't letting all the bullshit get in my way\nKnow that I stay caught in a daze\nCaught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze\nYou don't mess in my heart, things are looking up\nYou can see in my eyes, so you know I'm\nCaught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze\nPicture caught up in the day, holdup with these police again\nAnd these vehicles we\nThat's why they hate\nCustom colors is my\nIn up on 60's\nIf you ever trying to find my I'd probably be\nWith me\nOpen up baggy stuff like muffins\nOut of dope enjoy your crisis ain't in my buddy so f*ck it\nI stuck em up and got on the highway, ready\nGet fried like everyday is Friday\nIn the place I reside I keep that iron cause them goons gonna be lurking\nKeep my dough spot popping in my\nPut me on a licking anybody move I'm a murk them knock them off their shoes and get their ass to\nThat's for certain bitch\nYou flirting with death if you f*ck of mine\nShit you walk up and take your life in this life of crime\nIn this life of mine I took recent put my life on a line\nAgents ask me for a statement I decline\nI'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday\nAnd let me know the bullshit get in my way\nKnow that I stay caught in a daze\nCaught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze\nYou don't mess in my heart, things are looking up\nYou can see in my eyes, so you know I'm\nCaught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze\nIt's all they can never\nDown, deeply rooted in the ground\nWay I spit it's so profound, know the sound like some shit you heard before\nBut it ain't everyone's a\nNow but I'm using different paint man\nI'm using different egg for the story, this is guts this is glory\nIt's the rush of performing it's the slut when you're horny\nIt's the feeling that you get when you wake up in the morning\nAll that feeling that you get when the sun's dawning on another day\nAnd you ain't seen your life another way\nWorking at the same job for next to nothing pay\nPlugging away it's the dreams trying to hold this shit together\nWhile the worst tuck in away, the same sick\nStruggling it ain't no fame, one you looking back\nBut f*ck if you ever\nTry to\nFrom that\nSo why you see it like a vintage car\nYou put your all in your writing, I once\nYou can rise\nYou talk about it with your friends as a symbol of a hard work\nThis is all of me sewing there looking that doing lenses\nIt's probably right\nAnd my voice is so committed\nI'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday\nAnd let me know the bullshit get in my way\nKnow that I stay caught in a daze\nCaught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze\nYou don't mess in my heart, things are looking up\nYou can see in my eyes, so you know I'm\nCaught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze"

I skipped it like scratching your favorite disser\nI spend my whole life down on the ground and its time to live up\nThe 26's make it sit up, gotta lift my whip up\nI'm wrappin' up a pack and rap circles around these amateurs\nCan't hang with Freddie Kane on that stage, ain't got no stamina\nI damage ya, straight wrecked out, shows stay packed out\nAll my cars is antique, it's satin blacked out\nOld school more than your new school, I cashed out\nRidin' in that back seat passed out, I'm yak'd out\n\n[Hook:]\nRidin' in my back seat, wind in my hair\nSun in my eyes but it don't really matter cause we don't really care\nWhen the light hits the pane it shines till the sun creeps low\nBut it all goes when the smoke blows\n\n[Verse 2:]\nCruisin' down the 110\nDrop the top off my dunk and let my bald head hit the wind\nAs I take another sip of gin\nGot two cold pieces driving me, I'm talking cold as Michigan\nGot to get her cousins and her sisters in\nThey want that all star, all access, play with them rap vets\nBeen to every spot on your globe map or your atlas\nFive star feet, walk on waves and won't get wet\n\n[Outro:]\nYea, Gibbs and I won't get cursed\nStraight wrecked out, shows stay packed out\nStraight wrecked out, shows stay packed out\nOld school more than your new school, I cashed out\nStraight wrecked out, shows stay packed out\nOld school more than your new school, I cashed out"

It's none other than the Steel City stick up kid\nThe young gorilla\nNever been afraid to bust my gun for scrilla\nAnd I never, ever been the type to run from niggas\nI'm in the lac with the mac blowin' ganja nigga\nWe straight cruisin' with plenty of heat\nYou know the niggas from the G gotta keep the semis under the seat\nPlus my clique roll deep like the nation of Islam\nBut when it's beef we don't set up meetings with Farrakhan\nWe bomb on these niggas trynna stop our bread\nPut something hot in their head like Detroit Red\nI could care less about my enemies\nI leave 'em for dead\nI try to chill but these niggas pushin' me to the edge\nThey won't be satisfied til i pull the chopper out the holster\nDown for the cause, i'm a motherfuckin' soldier\nPlayin' my position I ain't bitchin' like other guys\nAnd i'm a G, without the G\nYou see these niggas sippin' 40s in the Tahoe\nThen they out in Beverly Hills sippin' on cosmos\nHomie you done stepped outta ya zone\nSo I hope ya gotcha\nGangsta Gibbs nigga"

(preach)\nGary, Indiana, Chi-Town man (tell 'em som')\nY'all know better represent my boy Freddie Gibbs spittin' that hot shit (let's go)\nCome on\n\n[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]\nYo, I'm the deal so a lot of labels wanna recruit me\nI got rank in the game nigga, you should salute me\nStand at ease when I rap, it's a breeze when I rap\nYou fat, you can barely fuckin' breathe when you rap\nI ain't the biggest dude but my rhymes push a lot of weight\nGo and do some exercise, lyrically you outta shape\nBut on the other hand, I'm nicely built\nSo on or off the mic you might get killed\nI swear to God you don't want no part of me\nI spit that sick shit that clog yo' arteries\nI have yo' ass gaspin', holdin' yo' chest\nAnd leave yo' body in a state of cardiac arrest woah\nRap for you is a waste of time\nAin't nobody gon' buy you like that P-Miller clothing line\nOr an album from No Limit\nThis is no gimmick, when I spit it's so prolific\nI ain't worried about these local cats\nI only listen to a lil' bit of local rap\nCause these cats try to diss you behind ya back\nBut  they really want you to rap one of they tracks ha\nNah, I listen to a couple of dudes but fuck rap man I'd rather bump rhythm and blues\nLike some Isley Brothers, some Frankie Beverly and Maze, a little Stevie Wonder, or some Marvin Gaye\nUgh, you talkin' shit I ignore you chumps\nNo Tamin' and we ain't got no love for punks\nAnd you know that we be makin' them hits\nFinger Roll make the beat, I write the rhymes while I'm takin' a shit\nThen I, hit the booth and I'm ready to spit\nFreddie the shit, all the bitches on my dick\nCause I shine and they see me glow\nBitches wanna give me ass cause the see me on the T.V. show\nMan just wait until my album drop\nI'ma have this whole city on lock, cause my album's hot\nAnd i know that y'all been waitin' a while\nSo I'mma hit you with this Full Metal Jackit like Private Pyle, ugh\n\n[Outro: Finger Roll]\nYo, what the fuck is up\nIf you don't know what the fuck is up then back the fuck up\nFull Metal Jackit blastin' at y'all niggas for the 2004\nFreddie Gibbs, Finger Roll lacin' this shit, holdin' it down\nPuttin' ya voices on his that hot shit\nShit's hot man, but y'all go ahead and chillout man\nI'mma go take a shit, holla at ya boy man\nFreddie Gibbs, 2-double-O-4 ya lil bitch\nUgh, muthafucka"

Yo, when I was growing up, everybody was tryna put it into\u2005my\u2005head that I\u2005had to be a doctor, a\u2005lawyer, work for some, you know, rich white man's corporation to survive, you know what I'm sayin', get up out the hood. But, deep down inside, you know what I mean, I wanted to be like my uncle; my uncle was a hustler, here to flip money, anyway he could to get it, bam bam, you know what I'm sayin'? So as a kid, I ain't really have no interests other than sports, you know what I'm sayin'? Then I got interested in rap, you know what I'm sayin', in my late teens. It's time to bring the raps back to the streets. My name is Freddie Gibbs, and this is my hustle. Yeah!"
