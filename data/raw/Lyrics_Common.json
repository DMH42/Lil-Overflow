  "plain": "Lonnie Rashid Lynn, Jr. (born March 13, 1972), better known by his stage name Common (previously Common Sense), is a Grammy and Oscar-winning rapper and actor from Chicago, Illinois. Common\u2019s inspired mix of poetic flow and hip-hop soul has helped him earn his status as one of the most respected rappers in the game.\n\nAfter being a ball boy for his hometown Chicago Bulls as a teen and attending Florida A&M University for business administration, Common Sense kicked in and he left school to become a rapper. He gained national attention after being featured in the Unsigned Hype column of The Source magazine in 1991. He released his debut album Can I Borrow a Dollar? through Relativity Records in 1992, followed by his breakthrough second album Resurrection in 1994, which features his hip-hop classic single \u201cI Used To Love H.E.R.\u201d\n\nAs his career began to take off, he was sued by the music group Common Sense over the name, leading Common to drop the \u201cSense\u201d and allude to the change in the title of his third album, One Day It\u2019ll All Make Sense (1997). He has released several critically acclaimed albums, including Like Water For Chocolate (2000), which features his J Dilla-produced hit single \u201cThe Light\u201d, and Be (2005), which was released under fellow Chicago musician Kanye West\u2019s G.O.O.D. Music imprint. He also joined musicians Karriem Riggins and Robert Glasper to form the group August Greene, and the trio released their self-titled album in 2018.\n\nCommon has appeared in several television shows and movies, including American Gangster, Selma, Suicide Squad, The Mindy Project, The Simpsons, The Wiz Live!, and The Chi among others. Common and John Legend won both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe in the Best Original Song category for their song \u201cGlory\u201d from Selma. Common also won Grammy Awards for his collaborations with Erykah Badu (\u201cLove of My Life\u201d) and Kanye West (\u201cSouthside\u201d) in the categories of Best R&B Song (2003) and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (2008), respectively."

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Common]\nNight blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work\nA warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt\nWish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed\nTrippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors\nThe age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies\nUncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me\nMy mother gave birth but she really never had me\nLeft to the hood to play daddy\nRaised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae\nWith weight so they weigh they status on the streets\nLicense plates that say they, motto\nThis is Chicago in the heyday\nSimilar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ\nA skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures\nSo many niggas, stacked upon each other\nIt's the black upon each other that we love so much\nWonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch\nUsed to gangbang, ain't really thug that much\nRather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch\nWent to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years\nMy college career got downed with a couple of beers\nCame back home, now I gotta pay back loans\nSame nigga, same block, same shit they on\nOnly thing different, quicker, they click that chrome\nIn my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone\nMan to man, I'm good workin' with my hands\nMy generation never understood workin' for the man\nAnd, of being broke I ain't a fan\nNow I stand in the same spot as my old man\nMy life I planned not to be on this corner\nI still wanna see California\nBut this is my world\n\n[Hook: Bilal]\nIt's your world\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nLife and death flow around us\nFour pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners\nIt's hard to stay grounded\nWe stay high, that's why old folks down us\nLost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us\nAin't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us\nWe paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures\nRemoved from Earth, only to return through birth\nKnew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth\nBetween God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass\nWith a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed\nShe know dairy so she say cheese to get bread\nIn the area where it's more weaves and less dreads\nKinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads\nSaid it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt\nShe was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt\nVery well in a world where self hate is overt\nHer stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike\nShe got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures\nDoin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her\nIn the ass, it used to be thicker\nLife is fast, some choose to be quicker\nI remember in high school she had a passion to sing\nNow she see herself in a casket in dreams\nThese are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack\nSelf-esteem, yo we forgot the dream\nOn our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme\nIn the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team\nThis queen never seen herself on this Corner\nShe still wanna see California\nBut this is her world\n\n[Hook: Bilal]\nIt's your world\n\n[Interlude: Kids]\nI wanna be a pediatrician\nI wanna be a governor\nI want to be a artist\nI wanna be a veterinarian\nI wanna be a model\nI wanna be a doctor\nI wanna be a ballet dancer\nI wanna be a football player\nI wanna be a astronaut\nI wanna be a obstetrician\nI wanna be a doctor\nI wanna be a nurse\nI wanna be a fashion designer\nI want to be a gym teacher\nI wanna be a architect\nI want to be a duck\nI wanna be a wrestler\nI wanna be a dancer\nI wanna be the first African-American female president\nI wanna be a police officer\nI wanna be a rock star\nI wanna be a gymnastics teacher\nI wanna be a captain of a police station\nI wanna be a drummer\nI wanna be an actress\nI wanna be a superstar\n\n[Outro: Pops]\nBe, be here, be there, be that, be this\nBe grateful for life, be grateful to life\nBe gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000\nBe-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie\nBe little black Sambo with bad hair\nBe aware of Willie Lynch-ism\nBe, be boundless energy\nBe a four star ghetto general, be no one except I\nBe a strong academic student, be an A student in Sociology\nBe food for thought to the growin mind, be the author of your own horoscope\nBe invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful\nBe a proud run, only to return to fight another day\nBe peaceful if possible, but justice at any rate\nBe high when you low, be on time but know when to go\nBe cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East\nBe absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves\nBe visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin\nA nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartographer\nA map maker, be able to find Afro-American land\nSearch thoroughly, it may be close to black land\nBe amended 5/5ths, be amended 5/5ths human\nBe the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life\nBe cupid, to world government\nBe found among the truth, lost tribe\nBe at full strength when walking through the valley\nBe not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top\nBe a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth\nBe loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King\nBe that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house\nBe... eternal"

And I just wanted to tell you- I just wanted to thank you because your lyrics are so positive for the women out here\nYeah, I appreciate that, I appreciate that, sister. You know, it's like I think we gotta portray women in a better light. You know how- you know most rappers is talking all this other stuff, making women look bad. You know, I was raised by my mother. You know, I got a daughter, so it's like-\nWait, 'scuse me- hold on- hold on- 'scuse me, one second, sister- 'scuse me, one second, sister\nBitch! Bitch, didn't I tell you to get out there! I don't give a fuck if there's police out there; I don't give a fuck if it's snowin'. I want you out there hoein'. This a business; you ain't gone too far to see that yet. You know what I'm talking 'bout. Get yo' ass out there on them streets! Get on goin', get my paper\nSorry about that, sister. Sorry for...\nOh my goodness! How you gonna disretropect me like that"

The sweet taste of victory\nGo head and breathe it in like antihistamine\nI know they sayin' \"Damn, Ye snapped with this beat!\"\nFuck you expect? I've got a history\nGroupie love now, gotta be them wheels!\nHaters back down, gotta be that steel!\nI know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!\nLook how they did D'Angelo ask him how do it feel!\nMy best friends worry bout me\n'Cause they know when you famous\nAnd you had made cash\nThe media aims at us\nAnd you be up so high\nIf you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash\nBut God don't ever give me nothin' I can't handle\nSo please don't ever give me records I can't sample\nSo I could vacate where it ain't no channels\nBut it's quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals\nThey say because of the fame and stardom\nI'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum\nI guess it's messin' with my health then\nAnd this verse so crazy when I finish\nI'm just gon' check myself in - again\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nThey say \"What's happenin'?\"\nWe say the facts and if, they lie\nWe comin' back for them\nThey might say... but they don't know!\n(They say, they say...)\nThey don't knowwwww\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nThey say \"Dude think he righteous\"\nI write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers\nAmongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is\nOn my paper, whether its weed or Isis\nThey say \"life is a game,\" so I play hard\nWritin for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job\nThey say \"Sef kept the hood together\"\nI tell the young, \"We can't play the hood forever\"\nPlay my cards right, they say I went too left\nThey showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F\nPlayed chess in this game of, pawns and knights\nNow I claim \"King\" like Don, or Frank White\nThey say my life is comparable to Christ\nThe way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice\nThey say \"The crochet pants and the sweater was wack\"\nSeen the corner, now they say \"That nigga's back,\" uh\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nThey say \"What's happenin'?\"\nWe say the facts and if, they lie\nWe comin' back for them\nThey might say... but they don't know!\n(They say, they say...)\nThey don't knowwwww"

Sound of my heart when it drop\nThe night that I met her, it might be forever\nI hear people saying that they like us together\nI ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better\nWith you, I admit I had issues\nLike ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence\nIt's more than clothes can say for you\nWhen I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you\nI pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust\nAnd accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust\nFrom the cloth\n\n[Hook]\nOh you're worried about when people stop and stare\nThat's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear\nCut from the same, cloth you just want to wear\nBut that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh\nLa la la la, la la la la\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is tailor-made love, fit like a snug\nAnything we can bear so let's have some cubs\nYou were there when my cuz passed away\nNot only does love, but life hatches day\nI appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you\nStrong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you\nLooking at things that we've been through\nThings that seem simple\nI know when to go hard and when to be gentle\nSentimental laughs and expressions\nLet's stay in the present, no time for second guessing\nYou said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked\nThe truth we address it, that's so unexpected\nYeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead\nYour hunger for affection will always be fed\nThank God we never sped and let love take its course\nCause what's inside of us, no need to outsource\nThe cloth\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey lover we can cover each other\nThrough the coldest nights, tight never smother\nIt's two things that seems to hold us together\nGod is our tailor and forever\nIt's two things that seems to hold us together\nGod is our tailor and forever\nIt's two things that seems to hold us together\nGod is our tailor and forever\nIt's the cloth\n\n[Hook]"

And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from\u2026\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nHot damn, black America again\nThink of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind\nThe color of my skin, they comparing it to sin\nThe darker it gets, the less fairer it has been\nThe hate the hate made, I inherited from them\nBut I ain't gon' point the finger\nWe got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie\nNeed to hear them songs sometimes to believe me\nWho freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?\nDrinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?\nEndangered in our own habitat\nThe guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back\nAs a matter of fact, we them lab rats\nYou build the projects for, now you want your hood back\nI guess if you could rap, you would express it too\nThat PTSD, we need professionals\nYou know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust\nFrom schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us\nTell your political parties invite us\nInstead of making voting laws to spite us\nYou know, you know we from a family of fighters\nFought in your wars and our wars\nYou put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two\nAnd then, maybe then we'll believe you\nSee black people in the future\nWe wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident\nAll men and women are created equal\nIncluding black Americans\n\n[Sample: James Brown]\nYou know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from\u2026\n\n[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Common]\nYo, we gotta start respectin' life more y'all\nYou look at your brother man you gotta see yourself\nGotta see the God within him\nWe brothers gettin' changed real quick over nothin'\nWe losin' too many of ours\nGotta recreate y'all\nYo, check it\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nKnowin' you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours?\nCause I created you, irresponsibly\nSubconciously knowin' the act I was a part of\nThe start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world\nHad myself believin' I was sterile\nI look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl\nTurnin' this woman's womb into a tomb\nBut she and I agree, a seed we don't need\nYou would've been much more than a mouth to feed\nBut someone, I would've fed this information I read\nTo someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave\nInstead I lead you to death\nI'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry\nBut I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially\nHavin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me\nPlus I wanted you to be raised within a family\nI don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma\nWeekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father\nFor a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do\nFor me to live forever I can only do that through you\nNerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun\nMust have really thought I was God to take the life of my son\nI could have sacrificed goin' out\nTo think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control\nCause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul\n315 dollars ain't worth your soul\n315 dollars ain't worth it\n\n[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]\nI never dreamed you'd leave in summer\nYou said you would be here when it rained\nWhy didn't you stay\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nSeeing you as a present and a gift in itself\nYou had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt\nBut you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are\nThrough our trials and tribulations, child's elimination\nAn integration of thoughts I feel about the situation\nBack and forth my feelings was pacin'\nHappy deep down but not joyed enough to have it\nBut even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it\nIs this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust\nBustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust\nOr is it that we don't trust each other enough\nAnd believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together\nGirl I want you in my life cause you have made it better\nThinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together\nWe talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives\nIt's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives\nI wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding\nBut I want our parenthood to come from planning\nIt's so much in my life that's undone\nWe gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one\nIf you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from\nBut I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God\nSo I can, discipline my son with my rod\nNot have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed\nThough his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame\nI had a book of African names, case our minds changed\nYou say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy\nSo quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy\n\n[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]\nI never dreamed you'd leave in summer\nYou said you would be here when it rained\nWhy didn't you stay\nI never dreamed you'd leave in summer\nNow the situations made things change\nWhy didn't you stay"

Diamonds are for the day\nThat means to shine, you find a way\nStayed on porches, backyards, and gangways\nLearned strange ways between Cole and Langley\nChampagne ambitions\nI pour it out for my man who made  his transition\nWars about paper, pussy, pride and ego\nBorn to fly, call me the bald eagle\nOpen shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though\nBoys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin\nThe hero that came from zero\nMy bars and my PR like Puerto Rico\nThis bra from the DR said I was fr\u00edo\nThat\u2019s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo\nPinot noir style, better with time\nI\u2019m gambling with watches getting better with time\nSo I\u2019mma ride this out for long as God allow me\nThey say \u201ctime is money\u201d, forever is my salary\nI shine tomorrow with what I do today\nYo, get this money, put the diamonds on display\n\n[Hook: Big Sean]\nOhh\nWalk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin\u2019\nChampagne poppin\u2019, bad thang poppin\u2019\nHeaded to the door, and ain\u2019t a damn thing knockin\u2019\nNooo\nWalk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin\u2019\nCampaign poppin\u2019, champagne poppin\u2019\nHit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin'\nNooo\n\n[Bridge: Big Sean]\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nTryna get it every way, every day, day, day\nTryna get it every way, every day, ay, ay\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nTryna get it every way, every day, day, day\nTryna get it every way, every day, ay ay\nTryna get it every way, every day, day, day\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nBars in alignment, stars in alignment\nRaw off consignment, God\u2019s in the diamonds\nEvolve from the science, power and refinement\nRead between the lines, hard to define us\nNiggas that\u2019s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us\nIn the Benz leaning like we biased\nI\u2019ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me\nYou can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash\nThe moment is to live it like your last\nMoments that we have never living in the last\nMy time, man, precious like diamonds\nLook through the glass, see what I magnify man\nI'mma be shining 'til I die man\nI\u2019m a rare diamond that\u2019s hard to find man\nClimbing to the mountain top, MLK day\nTo the streets I speak my piece like an A.K\n47 to 87 to the hundreds\nJewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted\nDreams reflect clarity, ain\u2019t no disparity\nBetween peace and prosperity, so marry me\nDiamonds\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nReminiscing when I had everything on layaway\nI\u2019m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day\nWay before the ballin\u2019 that was back off in the training days\nI used to hit the barber chair and say \u201cI need that fadeaway\u201d\nHad a crush on what\u2019s her name, the feelings never fade away\nOlder brother gang bang, banging like an 808\nSaid you can\u2019t take his chain away\nReal player you can\u2019t take this game away\nSlang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller\nBut you can\u2019t take my dame away\nDevil in a red dress, but she got that angel face\nI could teach her how to get it day-to-day-to-day-to-day\nThe G code is my combination\nCatch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces\nCatch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases\nWeed, money, pussy, liquor, that\u2019s my favorite compilation\nDiamonds\nDiamonds"

I know you groan\nWhen I'm in you, I feel home\nWe in the house of love, no lie\nAppreciate you more as time goes by\nWhen it's truly true, it don't die\nI see you in L.A., I see you in N.Y\nI see you in the A, I see you in the Chi\nI hear you when JAY still make the song cry\nTruthfully, I wanna rhyme like common sense\nYou the one that gave me that confidence\nYou the one that told me 'bout consciousness\nAnd said see beyond my metropolis\nYou put the booga-booga loop, pop lockin' this\nWe too far, ain't no stoppin' this (We're too far, now)\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nHere, here, here, here, here, here we go\nThey say that, that love makes you grow\nYou've been sen-sen-sensational\nInstrume-e-intational\nIn my life, you've been vocal\nBut at times, I felt like I didn't know you\nNow I know you had to grow too\nAnd experience life so you can know you\nWe all change, for what it's worth\nYou an angel and still down to earth\nIn many ways you like my religion\nWhen no one else did, to me you listen\nGangstas, gods, you hugged and kiss 'em\nNo matter, you stayed in my system\nYour eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin'\nAnd gettin' people out of prison\nThrough the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle\nThat's why we all love you\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nYou gave me a voice in the world\nIt's been hard to choose another girl\nThey trip when you mumble, they trip when you sing\nBut you gave us a chance to dream\nIn young thugs, you see a future\nYou recognize little uzi ain't here to shoot ya\nAt 21, you knew I was savage\nBut you said, \"Common, you will never be average\"\nIt's a cold world, we need JAY\nIf you could dot com, you could dot K\nYou rock two chains, keep your mind free\nYou see a Malcolm X in a YG\nYou told me I'm the mane like Gucci\nWith a chance to rap and make movies\nYou gave mills to the meek, to inherit the Earth\nBefore me too, you said, \"Ladies first\"\nThings get rocky, you there ASAP\nRocky or Ferg, you there to swerve\nI want you to get the love you deserve\nMy will made it on a mic' with words\nWith no name, I was a hard MC\nLove and hip-hop, on some Cardi B\nNow you a part of me, creatin' Tyler style\nA future ain't odd to see\nFree spirit, with young will like Jaden\nWhen I see you, you never agin'\nMade in America, for the world to see\nYou everybody's but you my girl to me\nI'm forever yours, to the tic-toc\nI'm still talking 'bout you, hip-hop\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you so just be who you are\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you so just be who you are\n\n[Outro: Common & Daniel Caesar]\nUh-uh, uh-uh\nYeah, yeah, we keep, uh\nWe keep, yeah, uh-uh, we keep\nYeah, keep, uh, we-we keep, uh\nWe, uh, ke-ke-keep, uh\nWe, ke-ke-keep, uh\nWe, we ke-ke-keep\nI-I ke-ke-keep it on\nKe-ke-ke-keep it on\nYo, let's, let's, let's go up\nYeah, we-we go up, yeah\nLet's, let's, let's go up, woah\nWe-we-we-we go up, uh\nLet's, let's, let's go up, uh\nWe-we-we-we go up, yeah\nLet's, let's, let's go up, uh\nWe-we-we-we go up, uh"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Common]\nAfter bein' 25 you know just trying to survive in the world\nAbout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?\nAnyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves\nSo bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nYo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn\nBegan, began with time\nBeing my bloodline is one with the divine\nIn time brother, you will discover the light\nSome say that God is Black and the devil's White\nWell, the devil is wrong and God is what's right\nI fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear\nThe rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear\nAs a child, given religion with no answer to why\nJust told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die\nCuriosity killed the catechism\nUnderstanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to\nAnd became a slave to master self\nA rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health\nMy mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons\nQur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital\nAnd got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys\nYou just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief\nBut one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em\nAnd use religion as an emblem\nWhen it should be a natural way of life\nWho am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right\nThat's who got you doing right and got you this far\nWhether you say \"in Jesus name\" or \"Hum do Allah\"\nLong as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you\nYou let that show towards others in the things you do\n'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne\nOnly 144,000 gon' get home\nOnly 144,000 gon' get home\nOnly 144,000 gon' get it, baby\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nI've lived and I've learned\nI have taken and I've earned\nI have laughed, I've cried\nI have failed and I have tried\nSunshine, pouring rain\nFound joy through all my pain\nI just wanna be happy with being me\n\n[Verse 2: Cee-Lo]\nLet me voice my concern\nSo many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn\nOur ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence\nSubconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince\nI've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place\n'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place\nSo I try to find the clue in you\nBut evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do\nWhy're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden\nDamn, something in me wanna know who I am\nSo I began my search, my journey started in church\nIt gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief\nHustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets\nTaught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with\nAnd I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school\nIt almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal\nTakin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran\nSearched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites\nHold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White\nSome leads were granted with insight\nAnd it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand\nHe still created with the imperfection of man\nSo, with following I disagree\nBy no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but\nI do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind\nThat's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas\nYou gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity\nBut one side you gonna have to choose\nAny chance to speak I refuse to misuse\nSo how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession\nBecome an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson\nIf a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\n\n[Hook]\nI've lived and I've learned\nI have taken and I've earned\nI have laughed, I've cried\nI have failed and I have tried\nSunshine, pouring rain\nFound joy through all my pain\nI just wanna be happy with being me"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Common]\nIn the Spirit of God\nIn the Spirit of the Ancestors\nIn the Spirit of the Black Panthers\nIn the Spirit of Assata Shakur\nWe make this movement towards freedom\nFor all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle\nYeah. yo, check it-\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nThere were lights and sirens, gunshots firing\nCover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent\nSeemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle\nBlood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh\nNo room to rest, pain consumed each breath\nShot twice with her hands up\nPolice questioned but shot before she answered\nOne Panther lost his life, the other ran for his\nScandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her\nComprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on\nTo life; she thought she'd live with no arm\nThat's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight\nThey moved her room to room; she could tell by the light\nHandcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin, it bit\nPut guns to her head, every word she got hit\n\"Who shot the trooper?\" they asked her\nPut mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her\nHer mind raced till things got still\nOpened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed\nShe got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next\nHurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex\nThey lied and denied visits from her lawyer\nBut she was building as they tried to destroy her\nIf it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse\nI read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse\nI wonder what would happen if that would've been me?\nAll of this just so we could be free\nSo dig it, y'all\n\n[Chorus: Cee-Lo]\nI'm thinking of Assata, yes\nListen to my love, Assata, yes\nYour power and pride is beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nIt seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her\nWalkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her\nThough she kind of knew\nWhat made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue\nArrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning\nUneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in\nA cell, one cot, no window, facing hell\nPut in the basement of a prison with all males\nAnd the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes\nShe'd exercise, paint, and begin to read\nTwo years in a hole, her soul grew weak\nAway from people so long she forgot how to speak\nShe discovered freedom is a unspoken sound\nAnd a wall is a wall and can be broken down\nFound peace in the Panthers she went on trial with\nOne of the brothers she had a child with\nThe foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed\nHeld tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed\nIn need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed\nOut of this situation a girl was conceived\nSeparated from her, left to mother the Revolution\nAnd lactated to attack hate\n'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate\nHer emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates\nThey fabricated cases, hoping one would stick\nAnd said she robbed places that didn't exist\nIn the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites\nThrough dark halls of hate she carried the light\nI wonder what would happen if that would've been me\nAll of this just so we could be free\nYeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me\nAll of this just so we could be free\nSo dig it, people\n\n[Chorus: Cee-Lo]\nI'm thinking of Assata, yes\nListen to my love, Assata, yes\nYour power and pride is beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nYo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring\nNews that she had had a dream\nHer dreams always meant what they needed them to mean\nWhat made them real was the action in between\nShe dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens\nThe fact that they always came true was the thing\nAssata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't've done\nMedical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun\nIt's time for her to see the sun from the other side\nTime for her daughter to be by her mother's side\nTime for this beautiful woman to become soft again\nTime for her to breathe, and not be told how or when\nShe untangled the chains and escaped the pain\nHow she broke out of prison I could never explain\nAnd even to this day they try to get to her\nBut she's free with political asylum in Cuba\n\n[Chorus: Cee-Lo]\nI\u2019m thinking of Assata, yeah\nListen to my love, Assata, yeah\nWe\u2019re molded from the same mud, Assata\nWe share the same blood, Assata, yeah\nYour power and pride, so beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\nYour power and pride, so beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\n\n[Outro: Assata Shakur]\nFreedom? You're asking me about freedom? You're asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, because I've never been free. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is\n\nThe way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to\nBlossom. Freedom is-- is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do--"

   "lyrics": "[Hook]\nSo we made it to this same end of the road\nAnd we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold\nHow I made it out with my soul\n\n[Verse 1]\nAshtrays and cigarretes, last days, indigenous people\nThese are adventures of young black millionaires\nI am the voice of the meek and underprivileged\nThe smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this\nOn the move like black slaves through the wilderness\nI write it, and still get invited to white Christmases\nWhen I was born, three wise men came to visit us\nOne a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner\nThey cracked the bottle then started giving gifts\nYou from Chicago, we want you to deliver this\nShow the walking dead who the true and living is\nSeparate the fake from who the real reals is\nHot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris\nHats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis\nFrivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings\nI guess it's my addiction to women\nI was in France, in to see Hennessy blending\nWriting my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams\nNow it's new beginnings like a born again Christian\nOn the mic, victorious, story is redemption\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone\nI'm standing here with my soul\n\n[Verse 2]\nFeed our souls with two fish and five loaves\nTeach a man to cook it for survival\nMy dad said it rained on my arrival\nNow a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow\nLike I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo\nOn the rock and roll with the coldest live show\nFor those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em\nLyrical gymnast, you set the bar low\nThis is the Kilimanjaro, like Twitter you can follow\nIt may be hard to read like hieroglyphics\nWritten on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival\nTruth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido\nCrash parties, any live yo\nIs libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang\nFrom the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow\nAli MC, I fight for more than the title\nYour idol\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Produced by No I.D]"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBow! Bow! I came through the door\nWith the raw Martin Margiela\nSuperstar status, everything stellar\nWith some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers\nNiggas already jealous\nWe in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers\nShe already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous\nGo to the bar to get around like a propeller\nThe barmaid's name is Stella\nI'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me\nAm I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party\nWanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah\nNiggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah\nSeen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah\nWanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha\nHmmmm! Well let me take my time\nShe ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight\nSeen that ass cause I got hindsight\nShe was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight\n'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt\nShe said \"You rap?\" Yea mummy\nI'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money\n\n[Hook]\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\n\n[Bridge]\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was all couture, in a Tom Ford\nSecurity guard let me in cause I'm lord\nOf finesse, the under, the rings, the dress\nCode is to always stay fresh\nAware of a chest cause I stay abreast\nShe was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest\nThis nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess\nKnocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled\nI'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove\nI won't have to take it back to high school\nRewind! No need to take me back in time\nKeep my mind on the grind and the great feline\nCause what's in front of me is this behind\nUp north, she's thick; down south she's fine\nTuned in to what I'm doing\nI'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing\nThe ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade\nShowing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me\nSaw me talking to slim and started acting shady\nDude got foul like crack in the 80s\nUh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo\nYou never know who got a Tec up in the disco\n\"You Hollywood.\" Nah nigga, I'm Chicago\nSo I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle\n\n[Hook]\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\n\n[Bridge]\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it"

It's the same thing over and over again. Feel me?\n\n[Verse 2: G Herbo]\nHave you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?\nFolly boy, O block, eastside\nWhere it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride\nCan't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?\nNiggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying\nUsed to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign\nI've been out there three days and I got shot at three times\nFelt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine\nI be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind\nI know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up\nBut they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper\nWhere I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major\nSmall crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us\nNo food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit\nSame niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with\nBetter watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit\nHomie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit\nI came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it\nFeds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean\nYou ain't never seen the shit that I seen\n\n[Outro]\nComing inbound, forty six minutes from 355.

I'm bad to the bone marrow\nThe Earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows\nWith Allah, my supernatural bodyguard\nNiggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage\nMC's who compete with lyrics and beats get crushed\nI'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch\nWhat?\n\n[Scratching]\n\"Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron\"\n\"I ain't scared of no nigga\"\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nI pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair\nOther nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs\nOn knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet\nSupposedly nice, taken for granted like life\nI write twice and drop singles in record pools\nNiggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle\nFuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit\nThe clique that you came in with, accents you flavor with\nLike moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours\nI'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for\nFar more advanced than a rapper whose career\nYou could only take a glance\nCouldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance\nI stand in a circumference of humbleness\nBut in the Chi rumble, it's mistaken as a weakness\nWhen poetry's in motion, like a picture, I'm the main feature\nAmongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers\nI make my living off of singles like Latifah\nIn between sheets like reefer with blunted senses\nYou couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence\nI'm cold with numb intentions\n\n[Scratching]\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Yo, sick with it\"\n\n[Verse 4: Canibus]\nYo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible\nComing to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you\nI be the all-seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral\nWith three-hundred sixty degree visual\nWhen the signal was given, MC's get bitten\nWith venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em\nMy style will get in 'em, way up in 'em\nMy face don't belong in The Source\nIt belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain\nI grab mics and murder shit\nIt's wicked as Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services\nYou heard of this, new lyrical verbalist slash herbalist\nThe wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless\nRap snaps, get your ass cracked like bear traps\nContaminate your air sacs like tear gas\nAnd I swear, black, try to battle me, you won't last\nI'll turn your ass into \"The Artist Formerly Known As\"\nYou gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics\nStrip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard\nSo fat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars\nPeople know who you are\nNow I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me\nUp in The Source chilling on page forty\nPut this in your CD-ROM\nWWW-dot-Canibus-dot-com\nYou can find me on the internet talking to chicks\nThat was sweating me off the \"Music Makes Me High\" remix\nI be talking mad trash, trying to get 'em to laugh\nSee, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass\nBring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave\nLet your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab\nYou know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2\nA Beast from the East Pt. II, coming to see you\n\n[Hook: Common and Canibus]\nIt's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear\nY'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared\nNow that I made the name Canibus a name you fear\nYou still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared\nThat's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\"\nSince I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear\nY'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared\nAnd since I made the name Canibus a name you fear\nStay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared\nThat's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\"\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\"\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\""

   "lyrics": "[MIGO (Channing Tatum)]\nUm, where are you takin' me?\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER (Common)]\nAha, so many questions. I think it's about time I give you some answers\n\n[MIGO]\nWow. What is this?\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nYou see, Migo\nThere was a time when Yetis lived beneath the clouds\nWe were alive and we were thriving till we came across a crowd\nOf Smallfoot, that's right, we used to live down there\nBut there were actions we could not forgive down there\nAnd though they used a different nomenclature\nMan, or human, they showed us human nature\nA dangerous species that we approached with wonder\nThey attacked with their spears and their smokin' sticks of thunder\nThey called us Sasquatch, they called us abominable\nThey chased us, pursued us, their persistence indomitable\nWe had no choice but to run and hide\nOtherwise, we surmised we were facin' genocide\nSo we climbed this mountain just to stay alive\nYou see, we knew that up here, Smallfoot cannot survive\nSo it was here the first law was written in stone\nIt was named and proclaimed as a truth to be known\nOur world is an island, it floats on a sea of endless clouds\nThat's how it would be\nAnd then we wrote more laws, more rules to obey\nFor the sake of us all, it was the only way\nTo protect us from all of the human ravages\nHeaped upon us by those human savages\n\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\n(Now you know, now you know) And new rules apply\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\nSo it's best just to let it lie (Let it lie)\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\n(Now you know, now you know) And you can't deny\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\nThat it's best just to let it lie (Let it lie)\n\n[MIGO]\nBut my Smallfoot, he's not like that\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nThey're all like that. Tell me, when you found him. Did he greet you with open arms?\nThey don't care about us. They don't care about anything but themselves. Which is why we must do the same if we care about our future\n\n[MIGO]\nWait, we're below the clouds\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nOr so it would seem, but look closer\n\n[MIGO]\nThose aren't clouds, it's steam\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nThe stones are working\n\n[MIGO]\nThe stones?\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nEvery job and every task is pointless as it seems\nAll of it ensures that this important machine\nKeeps turning and turning and spinnin' around\nSo those below don't look up and those above don't look down\nAnd they'll look 'cause even if they hear of these atrocities\nThe only thing stronger than fear is curiosity\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\n\n[MIGO]\nWait so, so none of those stones are true, they're all lies?\n(Now you know, now you know, let it lie)\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nGood lies to protect our world\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\n\n[MIGO]\nBut they need to know the truth\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nOh, do they?\nYou feel emboldened by your noble quest to find the truth\nI chalk it up to the naive innocence of youth\nSo let me share a secret that you'll learn as you grow older\nWhat's true or not true is in the eye of the beholder\nSo do you wanna prevent our own annihilation? (Yes!)\nThen our only goal should be to control the flow of information\nUnless you wanna see the Smallfoot conquer and pillage (No!)\nThen protect the lie and you protect the village\nLives are at stake, Migo. Your friends, your father, Meechee\nShe's curious and you know what they say: curiosity killed the yak\n\n[MIGO]\nSo what do you want me to do?\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nTell everyone you were lying about the Smallfoot\n\n[MIGO]\nBut they've already seen it, they--they're not gonna believe me\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nYou'll be surprised at what they'll believe\nYou think knowledge is power, Migo?\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\n(Now you know, now you know)\nQuestion is\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\nWhat are you gonna do with that power?\n(Hmm)"

Who do it better, we used to move together\nNow we not together, is this our new forever?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nHell nah, I'm waiting on your call\nTold you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls\nIssues that I had\nSome say it comes from not seeing my dad\nKeep moving on\nHard for me to stay away and stay in touch\nGirl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch\nThought I was okay but nights that I stayed up\nAss got me layed up, girl I never gave up\nOn you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough\nI know your young and you gotta live your life ma\nI thought it was the right time for me to wife ya\nI must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest\nSo confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless\nWho do it better, we used to move together\nNow we not together, is this our new forever?\n\n[Hook]"

I'm that boney homey from Stony\n(Common) You know me!\nOff the GP niggas see me on the TV\nTalkin' Take It EZ, and they was like \"He ain't hardcore!\"\nBut hardcore is far more than bats and gats\nIt stems back to the roots of being true\nIt's gonna get me Me, you just get you You\nWhat I look like, talkin' about some shit I ain't do?\nI ain't shoot nobody, I ain't shank nobody, I ain't kill nobody\nIt wasn't us, it was them\nThe Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to sho-gun\nIt takes one to know one, and no one can\nTell me how to be, 'cause I'mma be me, aight?\n'Cause I'm a man, now check it\n\n[Hook: KRS-One sample & (Common)]\nI love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me\n(Common)\nI love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me\n(Common)\nI love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me\n(Common)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling!\nWhen I'm chillin' at the flat, lookin' at the wall\nWondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit\nOn the mic I be talkin' shit\nBut some say my talk don't make no Sense\nI'm tryin' to make dollars\nMy momma told me to go to school and be a scholar\nBut school ain't for me\nSo don't even go there, I'm comin' out of nowhere to go where\nProbably in about seven years, I won't have no hair\nBut not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client\nI come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark\nA Raider that never Lost the Ark, on the shot\nBut now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath\nMy boy Adefo wanted to be a chef\nBut he went down South, and fell in love, call me love\n'Cause love is gonna getcha \u2014 I'mma getcha!\nI'm like B.J., my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya\nStyles from East to West, all across the country\nI'm like that big fat woman 'cause cats wanna bump me\nI probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster\nBut I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love\nI love my music, I love my momma\nI love myself, I love you, and you love me\nAnd this is, I'm out\n\n[Interlude]\nYo, I wanna say peace to my moms, my grandmomma\nLil Chandra, and John, yo rest in peace to my Aunt Stella\nRahsaan's moms, Ron's moms, Dawn's moms, Corey's moms\nWho are you?

I'm nice\nReal friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman\nFriendly like neighbors, not Jim\nBut like Gomer I got piles of loot\nAttention salute, I kill loot but won't dilute\nEven if I threw garbage on the ground I couldn't pollute\nMan, I'm too rich for that, bitch!\n\n(Ynot got the money)\n\n[Hook]\n(Common) So what's your name?\n(Ynot) I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht\nI got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet\nAnd when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy\n(Common) Cause without the money\n\"Ain't a damn thing funny\" (5x)\n\n[Common]\nYnot, let me tell ya a story\nOkay it was a black man a white man and a Chinese man\nThe black man of course he was po' (yeah)\nThe white man, he was rich (uh-huh)\nAnd the Chinese man, he owned a sto' (aight c'mon)\nOkay the black man lived on Beat Street\nThe white man lived on Wall Street\nAnd at the Chinese man's store is where they all meet\nNot really on the good foot\nCause the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes (damn!)\nAnd in his shoes there were holes\nBut the white man didn't care, shit;\nHe didn't have to wear it (uh-uh)\nThe scratch that he had, he got from his parents\nWith his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway\nEveryday the black man would ask him to spare change\nBut at him, the white man would stare strange\nSo the black man got fed up\nCause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him\nAnd took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him\nThe Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon\nAnd now the black man own the store\nAnd the name of it is Leon's\n(...What's that?)\nBarbecue, that is!

He's one of the greatest producers... greatest musicians of our time. For real, I really know that\n\nLike, I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats being made. You know, I really, really used to walk by and be like, \"Man, I'm blessed.\" I really felt that, like, during the time when he was making it, not like, I don't look back and have to say \"I was blessed, I know I was blessed.\" But during that time I looked and say man, I'm gonna see Jay Dee make beats every day, you know, as long as he was healthy, he was making music\n\n(J Dilla)\nCommon, ok for me, ok it's definitely not a Common album\nBut, it's Common"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Common]\nFlowers bloom, the early part of June\nNoon is the time\nStay in tune, there's a lot going through my mind\nGot up this morning, smelling like fumes of wine\nMy man had his bachelor's, an exclusive time\nWe're getting ready now, he 'bout to walk the aisle\nA pimp's funeral, but we're gon' walk in style\nI'm feeling proud, yet I'm feeling funny\nAnd it ain't cause his niggas still owe me money\nCause it's my buddy here\nWe've been through lots of years\nLot of beers, lots of fights, lots of nights\nDreams about our career\nNow we're here in these tuxes\nI remember back when we was hustlers\nMove work, doing dirt, girls say we ho'ed around\nStill doing it, we're just older now\nFixing his bow-tie, his collar, I fold it down\nI'm the best man, I'm supposed to hold it down\nWe're sober now, but I'mma be lit tonight\nOne of these bridesmaids, I might have to hit tonight\nHe said \"The Light\" is his first song, I'm honored\nIt's already been drama, she don't like his momma\nMaybe that's karma, huh, he's a good cat\nA good cat ain't supposed to be with a hoodrat\nI knew her back, back, when we went to FAMU\nAnd like a black college, a lot of niggas ran through\nScandalous, the type you can't trust\nWhatever you get her is just never enough\nPlus, about her, I know too much stuff\nOf being straight bogus, she's on the cusp\nI'mma hush, cause today is his big day\nThese colors we're wearing, yeah they're a bit gay\nBut anyway, I told him when we first started\nNow we must toast for the sincerely departed\nAm I being jealous-hearted, I'm debating\nMaybe cause my guy's in love, I'm just hating\nWe're waiting on Reverend Clayton and for her to get ready\nThe church bells is ringing and the ring is real heavy\nHeavy, heavy, heavy, heavy\n\n[Interlude]\nYou remember that, man\nYou remember that, yo\nYo, I ain't even, I ain't even gonna lie\nYeah, I can't really make it in step with this girl\nNah man, it's what a man's gotta do\nIt's a good thing for you, man\nYeah, we gon', yeah\nIt's gonna be right\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nIt's a Black wedding, you know it started late\nFamily members arguing on who gon' get a plate\nHis relatives saying they just can't relate\nTo her being his Mrs., it's a big mistake\nI feel the same way, I'm tryna be supportive\nIt's hard when I think of ball players she then courted\nBut I ain't gonna agitate, I congratulate\nIt's like a weave, half is real, half is fake\nThey knew the caterer, so they got it half the rate\nHer father, Mr. Cook, looking like he half baked\nPimped out in red velvet, his suit match the cape\nLooking at his watch, damn, how much these pastors make?\nBut wait, oh shit, there go his ex-girl Shawna\nMan, I hope it don't be no drama\nThat lady in the big hat, that's his grandmama\nFor him taking a step, I at least gotta honor\nCause maybe she changed, and I'm just tripping\nWe're walking down the aisle, the CD is skipping\nI read between the lines, see, that's the sign\nKind of mixed about when it will be my time\nTo settle down\nHer little niece Sherice throwing petals down\nLooking at marriage\nNarrow is the aisle, as they were saying their vows\nA ghetto phone went off with the song all loud\nWiping my brow, cause now I'm nervous\nShe looking beautiful in her dress, I'm looking at her curves\nIt's natural to look, I try to look off\nHe said, speak or hold your peace, I gave a good cough\n\"Are you serious?\" The reverend smelling filthy\nBut on the real, I'm the one feeling guilty\nCause if this was court and I had to tell the truth\nI should have told my man before he said I do\n\n[Outro - Cocaine 80s]\nI gotta tell you what's good, think it's all bad\nI congratulate you like it's all that\nGot my dress, I'll stand up for your celebration\nEven though it's love imitation\nImitation, imitation\nImitation\n\nCongratulations, my man\nFor real, good luck with that\nHey, you can't appreciate the sunshine\nIf it never rains\nAnd it's gonna rain"

I'm the comma comma chameleon\nI use to pop a wheelie on my blue and gray stingray, it had mags\nThat was when bitches had Gucci bags\nAnd wasn't rockin' Starters, looking harder than niggas\nHoes wore clothes, that exposed they figures\n8-7 stepped in the jam, next the police come\nFights there would be one, numbers I'd get at least one\nWe'd come to the get-together with whoever\nYou wouldn't know how deep we was, we all didn't sit together\nEat up all your vittles, drink your brew\nAnd then step to the next cue, let's do it again y'all\nThat was when mad was tall and phat was cold\nThe days of Old Chicago and Fun Town\nAs shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down\nBut the shit ain't as fun now, and the city's all run down\nWe'd troop down to Jew Town, talk a cat down on some gear\nHave enough for a Polish and car fare\nI stare, at what use to be better\nAnd think about who use to cop our liquor\n(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure\n\n[Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)]\nI'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh\n(Niggas be rollin)\nAin't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I\n(Niggas be rollin)\nGotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um\n(Niggas be rollin)\nWe gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm\n(Niggas be rollin)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got more rhymes than The Manor got folks\nHad style since I went to McDowell, wearin' boats\nAnd penny loafers though I had the nickel in mines\nWe use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme\nIt's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop\nSkeeter would hit from the same spot\n'til Marlon tore my shit down, get down\nPut your body in motion only the strong survive\nBut on the 6 or the 5\nLive is how the sets used to be, at the Racquet\nBall Club with music by, Andre Hatchett\nOr either a beat by Pharris at them country club parties\nWe'd be hot as hell and House studs would yell \"Aight, now money!\"\nSauers I would go there, hip-hop clubs were so rare\nI liked the music anyways and it was always hoes there\nWhitney Young and Kenwood was said to have the best chicks\nBut mostly Hyde Park and V hoes is who I messed with\nThe best shit was troopin' to the loop in your precisions\nCut class to get ass, but still go to division (I remember that)\nOver Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work\nBust a spoolie on the spread, but still have some on your shirt\n\n[Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)]\nI'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh\n(Niggas be rollin)\nAin't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I\n(Niggas be rollin)\nGotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um\n(Niggas be rollin)\nWe gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm\n(Niggas be rollin)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI tuned into BMX, and taped Farley on the tonemaster\nTook the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster\nThen HPK was the only station that would fuck with rap\nYou was on The Shore by yourself cats'd (would) say \"Up your hat.\"\nWhat you could you'd make of it, if you was a gump they'd take your shit\nEither fight or break for it, we'd go to the lake and get full\nMy drink then was Boone's and Red Bull\nI remember swimming in Avalon, and peeing in the pool\nI thought I was cool, with my \"Members Only\" and a bald fade\nWalk to Walgreens to get the Sportin' Waves pomade\nAnd soft brush, as we got older we would stalk, rush, and bang fags\nGo to Marshall's and change tags, I snagged 'nuff niggas\nIn games of Off the Wall, and softball, \"Piggy one\" I would call\nWhen I first got my three way callin', I caught marks tryin' to lie\nHome of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shy\n\n[Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)]\nI'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh\n(Niggas be rollin)\nAin't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I\n(Niggas be rollin)\nGotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um\n(Niggas be rollin)\nWe gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm\n(Niggas be rollin)\n\n[Scratched]\n(\"I'm Petey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago\")\n\n[Outro]"

I like to say \"was\" cause we gon' bring it to fruition wishing that it's gonna stop. You know and uh, all the violence that was going on - it happens in Chicago but it's happening around the world in many ways. You know, it may not be to the numbers that's happening in Chicago but it's happening in the inner cities all over America so we's talking about the conditions of what's happening when I said \"Nobody Smiling\" but it's really a call to action"

   "lyrics": "[Verse]\nHow should I begin?\nThis is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn\nAs I say it, the spirits enwhip me\nHe was raised in the belly of the city\nChicago, discovered by du Sable\nA Black Frenchman that I had to mention\nExtensions of a young man livin' on a low end\n47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline\nKnow Grandma Mable did the best she could\nYou know how young niggas want a testy hood\nThere he stood, taller than most black boys\nOne of the best ballers out of Illinois\nCollege in Ohio, this is like his bio\nTalks that we had, man, they was never idle\nHe talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible\nHe talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival\nHe talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital\nHe said y'all niggas love the bang 'cause you tribal\nSpiral of life, Chicago to Denver\nAnywhere he went, of attention, he's the center\n6'9\", big heart, big mind\nHe he spent a lifetime tryin' to be big time\nHe did in a way, he made to the ABA\nAnd the things he say on my record\nWhen I was a shawty, he bought me \"The Message\"\nIt was his messages in the life I would step with\nDidn't see him much, spirits are connected\nThe Father creates it, the son can reflect it\nHis perspective: sometimes seemed crazy\nHis perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant\nHis perspective: somehow it shaped me\nHis perspective: undoubted I feel it\nHe'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him\nI said, \"Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em\"\nThe fight that he had with cancer was a brave one\nTook Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication\nBreathing heavy, he talked reparations\nHe said, \"Son, we live through our generations\"\nOffspring, coughing, Gene Ammons playing\nIn the background, he was talking, I was praying\nOur Father, take care of my father\nAs far as he went, may I go farther\nMay our dreams and legacies live through our children\nThough I can't touch him, I can still feel him\n\n[Pops talking]\nYou know the other day I got a phone call. I got a message says pops you been gon from home too long. So I set my bags down and headed to 87th street. I was just back in the neighborhood ya know cruising the same street that I used to cruise in my long black Fleetwood. Listening to the Minister and Dr. King and my beloved brother Malcolm. First thing is see I'm boundless with spiritual energy. I wanna talk about the moral necessities of human justice. The power and the action of God-given dignity. One can not enter the gate if you hate. You gotta take the lead for the rest of the world, 87th is the street of knowledge. The streets of knowledge are all over the world. We got a possibility again of leading the world. Chi my Chi we gon ask you for safe passage for the kids to walk to school. Alright, my young homies, we got a mission to finish. We got the unborn that we got to provide the truth for\n\n[Tasha Cobbs]\nI gotta be honest it's so much different without you here\nBut I have no fear\nI'll see you when I get there\nTo that city bright and fair\nYou were all I needed you to be\nAnd now I thank you for all you gave for me\nSo Father, I stretch my hands to Thee\nNo other help I know\nIf you withdraw yourself from me\nSomebody tell me where, oh where shall I go?\n\nFather, I stretch my hands to Thee\nNo other help I know\nIf you withdraw yourself from me\nTell me where, oh where shall I go?"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Common]\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYou know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean\nI'm a Person In Making Profit\nSee, I pimp internationally\nI'm nationally recognized, locally accepted\nI pimp with the truth, that's the only method\n\n[Common]\nSeen her on Madison where Vice Lords be travelin'\nAnd Chevy windows be rattlin'\nAnd badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts\nHer body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched\nThick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig\nAsked her the name, one way to approach her\nSee she had game, she needed me to coach her\nExpose her to some paper, freedom and culture\nThe way a righteous pimp is supposed to\n\n[MC Lyte]\nAs he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune\nI ain't having it like abortion\nWalking with this stick holding his tip\nLooked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp\nIt was cold as shit, I'm waitin' on my ride\nAct like I didn't see him I tried\n\n[Common]\nMotion denied (pause)\nI felt the vibe like Roy Ayers\nShe was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators\nTold her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure\nThat's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand\nI'm a take you to a pimps promise land\nWhere no man can break ya, break ya, break ya\n\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nPimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers\nCustomers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god\nPimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers\nCustomers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god\n\n[Common]\n(Hey girl, come on over here, check it out)\nMake your next move your best move, choose me\n\n[MC Lyte]\nHow I look working for a nigga in a kufi?\nIf I was on a track you couldn't produce me\nWith them shits on your wrist looking goofy\n\n[Common]\n(Yeah, OK)\nI pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel\nYou been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level\nYou used to the same game, cats saying the same thang\nNigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream\n\n[MC Lyte]\nNigga, you must not know of me\nI'm the mack here\nOught to have you ho for me (Common: Get real now)\nPimp yo' punk ass, have you write me poetry\nI'm from a lane called cash, you too slow for me\n\n[Common]\nYou know why?\nI'm thinking bigger than baguettes, furs, and slick cars\nOr have you on the corner trickin' in strip bars\nIf you become mine the world would be ours\nRespect the game, and universal laws\n\n[MC Lyte]\nWhat, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall\n(Common: Try it)\nWhy you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball?\nI know pimpin' ain't easy but damn, you barely surviving\nWe can't ride together 'cause you ain't driving\n(Common: Oh, it's like that)\n\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nPimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers\nCustomers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god\nPimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers\nCustomers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god\n\n[Common]\n(This, this, this really how I look at it, check it)\nYou and I together is like Ashford and Simpson\nPicture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention\n\n[MC Lyte]\nThink I'm gon' risk my ass then give you the cash (Common: Yep)\nThat shit is the past, I got my own stable (Common: Where at?)\nI oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track\nMatter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract\n\n[Common]\nGirl, you getting beside yourself\nI'm trying to guide you\nHelp you see inside yourself\nI pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light\nHave you covering your body and have you eating right\n\n[MC Lyte]\n(Is that right?)\nI'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Common: Say what?)\nPimp rhythms, pimp flows\nPimp men (Common: And pimp what?)\nPimp systems\nGot stores called Big Pimpin' (Common: Where?)\nDown South\nIn Texas I ran the best ho house\n\n[Common]\n(So)\nI pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo\nHave Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou\n(MC Lyte: Yeah right)\nBring 'em back to the States to turn dates from Europe\nMade the dirtiest of hoes seem purer\n\n[MC Lyte]\n(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)\n(Common: Why you laughin'?)\nI'm laughin' 'cause you funny\nI make bitch niggas like you have my money\nI get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly\nYou'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki\n\n[Common]\nYo, whatever happened to loyalty?\nDon't you want to become royalty?\nOn the streets selling ass and oils for me\nBut you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you\nFuck you then I'm about to be a preacher\n\n[Common talking and Bilal singing background]\n\n[Outro]\nWell there you have it y'all\nThe story of pimps and hoes, y'all know how it goes\nIt's been the oldest profession\nThe whole thing is like a lesson\nAin't no second guessin'\nPimps y'all, hustlers\nAll that good shit\nYeah, yeah, 2000 and forever\nIt'll be here\nUh, uh aiight cool\n\n[Instrumental Outro]"

Y'all do the math\nNow the third, you probably heard from MOP\nThey say use them rocks to make 'em envy\nEnvy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony\nWhen niggas fucking with you but commit infidelity\nThey hate it, to see you celebrated\nCounting my paper, nigga, you could have made it\nLet me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth\nWhere niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth\nWant you to break em off, getting money it costs\nFor you to be a boss, ain't no taking off\nNow the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat\nIt\u2019s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street\nIt\u2019s a dude that\u2019s getting paid in full, cars and jewels\nSo his plate is full, but the way this nigga move\nHe is never full and he gon' want your food\nDon't overdo it, that's an underrated rule\nThe sixth is a fix that's in all of us\nWhen I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust\nWhen the drawers go down, the guards go down\nCause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now\nOkay, the seventh is a seed that many believe\nIs the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed\nKnew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other\nGreed is a mother, it\u2019s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff\nCops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off\nBefore I sign off, in the sins we livin'\nThe good thing is we can be forgiven\n\n[Outro]\nSeven deadly sins"

Then what am I stressing for?\nWe tight, then why can't I let it go?\nEverything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor\nLet it rain cause it's ancestral\nCleanse my heart so they can see the best in you\nLet it rain and come down visceral\nFor those no longer here in the physical\nLet it rain cause it's like tears from you\nJust like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do\nLet it rain, I know that it's purposeful\nSo that it can service you and return to you\nLet it rain, let the rain surround me\nAnd never drown me, I was lost when it found me\nNow in a dream is where I'll be\nImperial reign came down to crown me\nNow in a dream is where I'll be\nImperial reign came down to crown me\nImperial reign came down to crown me\nNow in a dream, a dream is where I'll be\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nAnd if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain"

Words stumbled on, she mumbled on\nSomething's on, oh shit, she lit, a habit she got, legit\nWe talked a bit, truthfully I was tired\nYouthfully, she was high with her friends, I said bye quick\nThe phone collided with my sleep again, three minutes later\nBut there's another layer, she said I didn't care\nShe said I wasn't there when she was younger\nSummer tour buses wasn't enough to show what love is\nShe said I did things that a dad doesn't, and that she had questions\nIf I'm a good father, why all the bad judgement?\nI'm looking past judgement, about to ask somethin'\nBut she was bag bustin', inside I'm mad, cussin'\nInside I'm sad, dustin' off my pride\nI thought that I did protect and provide, and I'm a father that's live\nWhat about them rides with you in the backseat?\nYou tellin' me if it's a wack beat, I came to a few track meets\nWeekend movies, I got you tickets to Lil' Uzi\nTruly I try, she said\n\"It's the things that you didn't do, not what you did\"\nIt hurt her spirit when she saw me with another woman's kid\nPeeled back and thought, to love her, I gotta listen\nNow love and action is the new vision, she said\n\"Dad, let your actions be your loudest speaker\"\nAnd now my daughter is now my teacher, with love\n\n[Verse 2: Jill Scott]\nShow me that you're there\nShow me that you care\nI've been looking for you\nBut you don't wanna share\nI've been looking for you\nEven over there\nWill you stay around this time\nOr should I be prepared?\nShow me that you're there\nShow me how you care\nYou like to come around here\n(You know actions speak louder than words, right?)\nShow me that you love me\nShow me that you care\nThis space is feeling empty\nBut you don't see me there\nYou won't feel the pain\nAnd you won't take the blame\nHow you come around here\nAnd you just stay the same\nShow me that you love\nShow me that you care\nWhen is the time for\nYou to pull a chair?\nAnd tell me who you are\nAnd tell me you'll be there\nAnd show up when it's hard\nAnd show me you care\nShow me, show me\nShow me, show me, show me\nShow me\nShow me, show me, show me\nShow me\n\n[Instrumental]"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Common]\nPhone rang\nScreen said caller ID blocked\nBut for some reason, I decided to answer it\nOn the other end, was a French accent\nHe told me we needed to rap quick\nCause he had did some bad shit\nAnd would be gone for years\nBut spending these last two days with his momma and his kid\nWhen he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it\nCause I knew he was a real good person\nAnd this didn't seem like it was in his spirit\nHe couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he had done\nHe said now it's time for him to turn himself in\nFor no longer could he run, from life, from God\nI started thinkin, \"Why is doin' right is so hard?\"\nI thought back to when we was in London\nDiscussin' the New Testament, and how our lives related to it\nAnd how we could make the best of it\nMy voice became desperate, so I asked him, \"Why you gotta go?\"\nHe said, \"You know, turn to Matthew 24\"\nHe said, \"No one knows the hour, nor do they know the day\nBut the kingdom is near; don't let anything lead you astray\nAs long as God is with me, everything will be okay\"\nSo right about then, we decided to pray\n\n[Refrain: Omar Lye-Fook]\nJust lying back, making the smoke disperse away\nDeep into clouds (deep into clouds)\nIt's making things appear to me so clearly\nDeep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)\nJust lying back, making the smoke disperse away\nDeep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)\nIt's making things appear to me so clearly\nDeep into clouds (yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: Cee-Lo Green]\nYour time, is a terrible thing to waste!\nFor there's, not one of these possessions\nThat you can bring to space (yeah, it don't matter)\nIt's a challenge\nBut the chance of seeing it, is quite a dream to chase (yes it is)\nI hope, I remind God of him\nWhen he sees my face (yeah he will)\nHe gon' see it!\n\n[Verse 2: Bilal]\nHigher (keeps on)\nThis feeling just keeps on, hehe, lifting me higher (ever)\nAnd it's ever flowing, it's ever flowing (keeps on)\nWhen everything, puts a smile on my face\n(Ever flowing, ever flowing)\nAnd I recognize this strong goal\nBut I keeps on going\nI keep on going (he keeps on going)\nI keep on going on, ohh\n(He keeps on going, he keeps on)\n(He keeps on going)\n(He keeps on going, he keeps on going)\n\n[Verse 3: Jill Scott]\nAll mighty love, watching over me\nA smile, brilliant\nAll over, constantly\nWarm, comforting (comforting)\nPerfect, like, no-thing\nNo haze, no confusion, no strain\nSimply, peace\nSimply, simply, simply, simply\n\n[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]\nNo fear! Heaven is to me\nNo fear of destruction, oh oh oh oh\nUnderstanding who he is\nHis name is Christ, yeah (oh oh oh oh)\nHeaven, Heaven is to me\nWisdom, understanding, knowledge\nOh (understanding)\n\n[Verse 5: Erykah Badu]\nStreets of gold and pearly gates\nHalos wings all dressed in white\nHah (hah) hah (hah)\nAngels sing and cymbols glare\nNo one's rich, no one's poor\nHah (hah) hah (hah)\nPeople dreaming they live free\nMaking love while they in love\nHah (hah) hah (hah)\nWonderful dream\nWake me when you're home\nHah (hah) hah (hah)\n\n[Outro: Lonnie 'Pops' Lynn]\nHeaven? Heaven is being Pops\nHeaven is spending a day with the grandchildren\nListening to they voices, and laughter and play\nAnd then at the end of the day\nWe hug, we kiss, and slowly they walk away\nAnd then suddenly, they turn and rush back to me\nAnd hug me around the knees\nYeah, that's Heaven to me"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nGotta watch out for them critters...\n\nI get the party live, Common Sense'll get the party live, huh (4X)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was born in Chicago, raised on Planet Rock, talking zuh zuh zuh zuh\nCats knock my tape like boots, I'm as fresh as fruits\nYou pussy MC, it's you I rebuke\nRepent! You burn up, you got me bent\nI'm current as an event, got on big hoes at Freaknik\nFrequently you're telling me Whoopty Woo can rock it\nSo? He ain't put no scratch in my pocket\nYo herb, with my hand I cock it\nAnd rock it like that brother in Colors, 'cause I want y'all to live\nMy crew is too live, we sneakin' to the rear\nBut I can't get us all in free (What?)\nIt's just another case of that 2-dollar emcee\nI rock the same clothes 3 days straight\nTo you they wrinkled but to me they straight\nNow I'm straight; are you straight?\nI'm straight as long as I got beer\nI thought about it, Jack, and now I'm outta here\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Maintain the rock, don't stop the rock\") (8X in background)\nI get the party live, Common Sense get the party live\nI get the party live, Common Sense get the party live\nWe get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live\nI get the party live, Common Sense get the party live\n\n[Verse 2]\nI need me some new socks (uhh), I need me some new drawers\nI draws attention, like a letter to a sergeant\nThere's a few good emcees, the wack I'm giving code red\nSlim say I ain't got no body, but when they see me at the party\nThey be like, \"Go 'head, go 'head\"\n'Cause I got's the cuts like Bobbitt, rappers are dickheads\nShoppin' they demo, I do 'em like Big Red\nMy office hours are from 9 to 5\nWhile you avoid the party I make it live\nThe fellas nod and the chicks dance\nWhile I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants\nI'm as dope as PCP; MC's see me and they start having flashbacks\nI don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back\nNowadays blacks don't know how to act\nBesides Larry Fishburne, Charles Dutton, and Wesley Snipes\nMarks wanna test me because I test the mics\nBut I check 'em like sound, and like Goose, I'm down\nPlus I done got better since \"Soul by the Pound\"; I'm maintaining\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Maintain the rock, don't stop the rock\") (8X in background)\nWe get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live\nWe get the party live, 87 get the party live\nI get the party live, Common Sense get the party live\nWe get the party live, UAC'll get the party live\n\n[Verse 3]\nI fall fresh upon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelmin'\nAnd house more hoes than Spelman\nWords I'm weldin' like James Johnson\nMy brains sponsorin' speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson\nRappers I'm fondlin', they try to settle out of court\nBut I could never be bought\nWhat type of rebel eats pork?\nI'll take the cat and never get caught\nU-AC together we fought\n'Cause I can't see my mellows boxin' and me not boxin' wit' 'em\nI don't care who started it, I'mma be a part of it\nRegardless of the odds of how hard\nIt's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with 'em\nI got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes\nBut a 5 becomes a 10 when a brother's off some gin\nI got juice, and this nigga scared\nI'll F your head up, like the LA Four\nWhen I flow like cash I go for broke like Melba Moore\nWhy should a male with a B.A. get more than me?\nWhen Rashid got an MC degree\nAnd a doctorate in rockin' shit, I go to Dock's to get\nA fishwich with cheese\nI don't mix with MCs, 'cause I just don't like them mother\u2014\nBut I'm still maintaining\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Maintain the rock, don't stop the rock\") (8X in background)\nWe get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live, yeah\nWe get the party live, 87 get the party live, yeah\nI get the party live, Common Sense get the party live, huh\nWe get the party live, UAC'll get the party live"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Common]\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nNigga deep in the rhythm, experience speaks\nI'm keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek\nI seekin' it with 'em\nI'm dope, the streets need me to hit 'em\nWith some of that (revolutionary rap) revolutionary blunted rap\nMy peoples want hits, I hit it from the back\nUnder the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes\nMy guys pack heat, enough to bury June\nOn my feet, I'm getting married soon\nWalking in the clouds like Mary Bethune\nThe fumes of a real nigga seep into your room\nOr through fifthteens of the Jeep that you boom\nSon so many cats, they call me high noon\nOfferings to Oshun, hoping war is over soon\nGuard your grill like George Foreman\nTime to build, as far as building, I'm the doorman\nOpening doors, my blood I expose on the floors\nTell them the game ain't only the score\nHold on to your life as I carry these styles\nTo have you tapping your head like Darius Miles\nYou ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line\nIn this business of pimps, many hoes get signed\nOpposed to shine so me holding the blinds\nMixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine\nIn the age of Aquarius\n\n[Hook: Bilal & Erykah Badu]\nThe water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba)\nTo purify the world (do-ba ba ba)\nFlying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba)\nSo watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba)\nAquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nBetween churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks\nWith raps, all over your head like Tweet\nPlaying with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth\nHot for a minute, watch your name just melt\nSame spot where it's joyous where the pain is felt\nAs you build and destroy, yo remain yourself\nThey say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams\nAnd rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme\nOr the struggle of fiends\nI flow over water that's as troubled as teens\nFor the love of the team, trying to double the dream\nBe grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings\nI'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones\nPunchlines like Roy Jones with poems\nWhile you and your dogs foam at the mouth\nThinking rap is the only way out\nThe black human genius will never play out\nI take you way out, where you never been before\nBeen it since birth, sent to replenish the Earth\nThat truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse\nI deaded your shit before you finished a verse\nFrom niggas to gods from bitches to earths\nFrom Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse\nRealness is an act that you cannot rehearse\nHolla back, but listen first\nWe in the age of Aquarius\n\n[Hook: Bilal & Erykah Badu]\nThe water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba)\nTo purify the world (do-ba ba ba)\nFlying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba)\nSo watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba)\nAquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)\nThe water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba)\nTo purify the world (do-ba ba ba)\nFlying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba)\nSo watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba)\nAquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)\n\n[Outro: Bilal & Erykah Badu]\nAquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)\nAquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)"

Don't waste it\"\nThe pain that you had, it was hard to place it\nFor my dad, I couldn't be a replacement\nI yearn for plates with catfish and collard greens\nYou got me into school, off of Mama schemes\nI know I can lean, on you for anything\nAin't have to want for nothing, you my everything\nThey say we don't get to choose our mothers\nSomehow I know our souls chose each other\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nSaint something, please protect this family\nGive cover, from the world's insanities\nI know you got a lot on your plate\nThe stress is on a lot of your faith\nAnd no matter what's coming\nI will be there, I will be there\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nJesus walked across my lawn\nAnd told me you the mom I'm supposed to have\nNobody in my life is as close as that\nIf I'ma write you a song ain't no holdin' back\nNow, I wasn't raised in no cul-de-sac\nYou said, \"Stay in school,\" 'cause you ain't know I rap\nTeachin' me in moments I ain't know was class\nThat's why every girl I go home with be showin' class\nWhen I show my ass, you gave me a whippin'\nThe paradigm shifted and parentin' is different\nBlack woman strength in search of vulnerability\nYou did everything you could and did it willingly\nInstilled in me values of what a child do\nTo say you my Ma, I'm ever so proud to\nYou wrote me letters to get myself better\nI still cherish when we pray together\nThat's a time I really feel the Lord\nI thank you for the your declarations and your vision board\nIt hit a chord, when they rolled you into surgery\nMama, you the sky and earth to me\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nSaint something, please protect this family\nGive cover, from the world's insanities\nI know you got a lot on your plate\nThe stress is on a lot of your faith\nAnd no matter what's coming\nI will be there, I will be there\n\n[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah (Oh-oh)\nAh, ah, oh, oh, ah, ah (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nAh, ah, ah, ah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

I don't know what was on y'all niggas' birds\nTo go up to the boat - and start robbin' old folks\nNow see you done messed with the wrong old lady\nYou done went wild; yo, check it...\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again\nDude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him\nFour in the mornin, my phone ringin\nI'm thinkin, \"Who da fuck is this,\" on the other line screamin\nTold em, \"Geek down,\" but they was breathin hard\nIt was my grandmother tellin me that she had been robbed\nI told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over\nFreezin but this situation made the night colder\nKnew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker\nWith some friends in a club at the boat gettin bub'\nSaid she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uhh)\nNot gamblin but every now and then they'd smile\nThen BLAOW! They up mags\nAnd told everybody, \"Put your shit in the bag\"\nMade people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)\nHad the place took in a minute and some seconds\nAsked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)\nSaid she couldn't remember\nShe was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em\nCause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me\nWith they pants hangin off they ass\nGot her some water - and begin to think\nHow these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?\nSomebody round the crib know the deal (uhh)\nWhoever did it better have Blue Shield for real\n'Cause yo, it's the big payback..\n\n{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}\n\n[Verse 2]\nLater that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up\nThem niggas probably knew somethin plus I needed a cut\nWalked in they was playin Jigga (jihh-gga..)\nDiscussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger\nThese niggas next to me, was talkin bout the heist\nWhoever did it even got Jordan for his ice\nSaid that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin\nHad to use all my might not to ask no questions\nPut down the magazine, went to the pop machine\nNoticin these cats, had the Bling Bling\nThey wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team\nA week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring\nThis hype came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's\nWas braggin bout robbery they had done\nBy now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I\nSee gramps bracelet\nI'mma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run\nIt's the big payback..\n\n{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy imagination roamed as I got in the chair\nThinkin - when shit went\nDown, I wish I was there\nFuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care\nHave your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear\nThese chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it\nSaid it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's\nEight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky\n(Like who?) Like dude, that do drum'n'bass\nThere was a air in the place, that made me suspicious\nNormally, they'd be\nTalkin like bitches\nMy barber cut me with a quickness (what?)\nAsked him where he got the new bracelet\nHe said it was his sister's - I knew then\nWhat made it official, he gave me my change\nThe money clip had gramp's\nInitials (c'mon)\nAs I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up\nPulled up in a Cadillac truck\n{*gunfire*}\n\n[Police scanner]\n...we have an arson, three-alarm fire, murder in a possible homicide\nThe building is entitled \"The Ultimate Barbershop\"\nThere are six unidentified bodies in the building\nThey are all presumed dead\nI repeat they are all presumed dead\nHowever there are no suspects\nI repeat, the subjects are at large\nWe might need some backup..\nInform O'Malley that we need backup, over...\nThe skit definitely needs more siren added to it\nPlus a new writer for the script, thank you...\nSomeone get Prince Paul on the phone please...\nThank you..."

You don't know me?\"\nI'm the black guy in the flick with Angelina Jolie\nBoldly, she told me 'Oh you got moves'\nHer friends said 'No, really though, he's a good dude'\nAfter couple months of dating and pairs of good shoes\nBeing snapped by the papps, we shared the good news\nWe were engaged, though many was confused\nI'm from the windy city, so I will not lose...come on\n\n[Chorus: Queen Latifah]\nI'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close\nSqueeze you tight, the next time that I see you\nI'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart\nAnd I hope I die\nThe next time that I see you\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nShe had a dope figure, y'all can go figure\nShould of listened to 'Ye, cause she was a gold digger\nI ain't a dumb nigga, she was able to pull it\nLove happy, blindsided like Sandra Bullock\nOr could it be, things go the way that they should\nFrom the, unexpected, love could be understood\nAnd in the real game, only love can win\nI got to win, cause I fell in love with her friend\n\n[Chorus: Queen Latifah]\nI'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close\nSqueeze you tight, the next time that I see you\nI'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart\nAnd I hope I die\nThe next time that I see you"

   "lyrics": "[Pops]\nHey, hey old bean\nAnd you to baby sweetness\nYeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio\nAnd I didn't have to break in this time\nI'm back as a special guest by special request\nAnd I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again\nThey may have to rassle to get it back\nYou know, as a result of my son Common touring the world\nPops has acquired a wonderful extended family\nFrom around the globe\nHe has returned with positive messages to my earlobes\nFrom all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan\nAnd of course in the motherland\nEven in the orient, they know what I meant\nNanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan\nSo I didn't come in here to give any shouts out\nI came to give praise and honor and to identify my children\nWho've been saying and doing the right things\nYou know they sat on those nines of 1999\nAnd kept them from turning upside down\nAnd teaching the babies\nTo love, to be able to give love\nAnd to enter the new century with their own prophecy\nThe century of amends\nYou see I deal with the premise that all children are ours\nAnd that we all travel the same path\nIt's just that we don't get there at the same time\n(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime\nAnd to my children running around here\nTalking about how nice is they ice\nThat they've already paid for twice\nWhat karat is they gold\nThat was yours before you were done in the hole\nOr that crew from 1629, buy some land\nThink agriculture; beat that neighborhood\nWhich you claim you love so dear\nAre you mankind or what kind of a man?\nSee, Pops is straight out of the garden\nFrom when the world was starting brand new\nHip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the Underground Railroad\nIn it's purest form\nYeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad\nIf the message is not for you\nIt can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze\nSo when you see me traveling on a spiritual high\nI'm flying high with Cee-Lo\nOr maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow\nEverybody knows there's no fruit on the tree without The Roots\nAnd Black Star said we are what we are\nThe Knowledge Of Self Determination\nAnd my little homie KG\nUp there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes\nKeep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind\nSo if your heart is real\nYou will hear Big Will, and Mrs. Lauryn Hill\nIf your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism\nAnd you can't go right until you go left\nAnd get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff\nChildren, I've traveled this globe\nNorth to south, east to west\nAnd whenever my soul appears lost\nI follow the musical sounds of a Tribe Called Quest\nOkay, we ready to get out of here\nWe ready to take it home now\nJust so everybody knows\nWhen Pops get ready to say something good\nI mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood\nAnd it ain't no time for no shecky shecky\nThat's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Becky\nY'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't exist\nI just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Common]\nShe rested her head upon my chest\nSensed liberation in between breaths\nWonder if sex is what she found it in\nPeace, found it laying down with men\nWasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her\nIt was more than bodies we shared with each other\nWe layed under the cover of friends\nA place where many lovers began\nI began, to feel her body shake in my hand\nBody language, it's so hard tryna understand\nUsually after sex, it's a good feel\nTook by silence, emotion stood still\nI could feel, her tears spill from her grill\nHurt from before that began to build\nShe told me, \"Hold me\", a story she assembled it\nTellin' it, trying not to remember it\nIt was a story of innocence taken\nThought she could redeem, through love makin'\nWhen she was eight, she was raped by her father\nAnd tried to escape through multiple sex partners\nFelt pitiful, she had only learned\nTo love through the physical, inside it burned\nMy heart turned, I thought of what this man did\nShe forgave him, she grew to understand it\nHer soul was tired and never really rested\nOnly through men, through aggression\nSaid it was a blessing and it happened for a reason\nBy speaking it, she found freedom\nBetween me and you\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nSometimes I wish a, careless whisper\nStill could be heard, without speaking a word\nBecause of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer\nI feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nShe laid, I watched her breathe\nHappy to be here, not afraid to leave\nI couldn't concieve her not being here\nDeath in her face her not having fear\nLess than a year, she was diagnosed with it\nMemories of that year, so close and vivid\nHappiness, would only visit, once in a while\nTo watch an adult, becoming a child\nSomehow, I knew she'd make it\nThe life of one so given early, would God take it?\nHurt she placed in, hope and prayer\nHurt she placed in chemo and lost hair\nI stare with my eyes closed\nWonder when the body leave, does the mind go?\nWatchin' Jordan became less important\nSeeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs\nAccording to doctors, there's no cure\nWe went through doubt, and cases of insure\nWish I knew then how to heal with herbs\nKnew a part of her I could heal with words\nBut the creator was sending for her\nWhat seemed like the end was the beginning for her\nLike that, she didn't want us to remember her\nNo more medication did she want us to give to her\nIt spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath\nOnly to be freed through death\nBetween me and you, between me and you\nBetween me and you, between me and you\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nSometimes I wish a, careless whisper\nStill could be heard, without speaking a word\nBecause of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer\nI feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nHe spoke with his eyes, tear-filled\nA lump in his throat, his fear built\nMy whole life it was instilled\nThis ain't the way that men feel\nA feeling, he said he wish he could kill\nA feeling, not even time could heal\nThis is how real life's supposed to be?\nFor it to happen to someone close to me?\nSo far we'd come, for him to tell me\nAs he did, insecurity held me\nI felt like he failed me\n'Til his spirit yelled help me\nI'd known him for like what seemed forever\nAbout going pro we dreamed together\nNever knew it would turn out like this\nFor so long he tried to fight this\nNow it was no way for him to ignore it\nHis parents found out and hated him for it\nHow could I judge him?\nHad to accept him if I truly loved him\nNo longer he said had he hated himself\nThrough sexuality he liberated himself\nBetween me and you, between me and you\nBetween me and you, between me and you\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nSometimes I wish a, careless whisper\nStill could be heard, without speaking a word\nBecause of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer\nI feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me\n\n[Outro]\nLiberation, peace"

If you straight, then I'm straight\nRock me tonight, just for old time's sake\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack to our regularly scheduled program, program\nI am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam\nLike Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian\nCause see I want it quiet in here...\nI Mark a Marky and a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases\nPlay like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises\nTo stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors\nI'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nFor a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold\nAnd reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male\nAnd I can't tell, why for a ho you grow a tail\nAnd stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell\nAin't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid\nShit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid\nGot doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass\nIf I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache\nI must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black\nIt's like McDonald's sellin fatback\nGet back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks\nI'm hearin rap from Anthrax, my time the Caravan cracks\nYou're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter\nWhen we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer\nI'mma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups\nRhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops\nI'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far\nI feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R\nOr whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles\nBut you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nIt's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker\nThink of that boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta\nIs stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk\nIf soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk\nIf if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff\nIt's not a myth about our dick width\nI'm swift and I shoot the presents\nIn essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff\nI'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL\nMy last name should be Smith-sonian\nI'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum\nGet em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian\nAnd turn off the lights this is the likes of a\nTicketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother\nGot Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter\nA chick is a chick that's how I treat her\nNever go pop I'm not a two liter\nA true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow\nWhether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto\nWear em? No, share em? A ho\nI like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro\nCause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations\nThat holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\""

(I don't know..)\nPressure is mountin'\nOh baby now, how we gonna get through? (I, don't, know)\nCan't go left (uh-uh) can't go right (uh-uh)\nDon't know, how we made it through the night (c'mon c'mon c'mon)\n7 minutes to sunrise\nOh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nIt was once said by Black Thought that Things Fall Apart\nKnew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start\nBut I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin'\nPlus me and sister blend before we got intimate\nFriend or no friend, my man caught wind\nThis chick is payin' me, it'll either cost me or cost him\nTold her she shoulda lost him (when?) a while ago\n'Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo\nI ain't here to start on this [nigga] for me to wreck his broad\nYou could tell what I thought of this [nigga]\nNickname was Smoke, don't know if that was 'cause of cigarettes\n(or what?) or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck\nSo I wasn't tryin' to call his bluff, by his persona\nYou could see, he think he tough!\nIf that wasn't enough, old girl had his son\nThis is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uhh\n\n[Jill Scott]\n6 minutes to sunrise\nOh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)\nPressure is mountin'\nOh baby now, how we gon' get through? (I, don't, know)\nCan't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (uh-uh)\nDon't know, how we made it through the night (yo, we got..)\n5 minutes to sunrise\nOh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nI understand that time is runnin' out, I'm thinkin' of town-skippin'\nGot a Chevy but the alternator be trippin'\nI'm hittin' rum straight, thinkin' of a route to truncate\nThe streets is watchin', out is one way I put myself in his Nike's\nHis position is, \"Aight man, somebody bonin' my lady\"\nProbably snap like Rod-man\nMy plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki (when?)\n'round four, when she was comin' she would beep me\nI sat deep in the corner, drinkin' zombies, becomin' one by now\nWonderin' if my style would support her and her child\nOut the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?)\nOne of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried\nTold Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot\nOn some \"Nobody's Supposed to Be Here\" [shit] like Deborah Cox\nLooked at my watch, [shit] I don't even got a watch\nFelt for my Glock, damnit I don't even got a Glock, yo\n\n[Jill Scott]\n4 minutes to sunrise\nOh baby now, what are we gonna do?

(Do it, do it..)\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nPressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin'\nIt ain't good lookin', like a black promoter I'm talkin' bookin'\nNot that I'm spooked of dude, I could whoop him\nBut he was on the horn informin' the rest of them hoodlums (aight)\nUsually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine\nWas messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time\nMy pager went off, it read one line: \"Come get me\nFrom Halsted\", I'm thinkin' this is monkey bar [shit]\nWent to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy\nSituation number nine, got my mind dizzy\nWondered if this plan was designed to get me\nI've been drinkin' too strong to be thinkin' too long\nLike 40 goin' North I'm doin' 50, headed for the spot\nAskin' God to be with me, and lately\nShe has been actin' shifty -- (but what?)\nBut then it hit me (hit me) it hit me (hit me)\nIt hit me (hit me) it hit me\n\n[Jill Scott]\n2 minutes to sunrise\nOh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)\nPressure is mountin'\nOh baby now, how we gonna get through?

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Common]\nMy first memory, my birthday on a party bus\nPops wasn't there but that wasn't obvious\nIn Mom's arms, in God we trust\nBlack Mama love, everything marvelous\nI didn't know what I was missin', part of a system\nPops is gone, Uncle in prison\nInside wishin' for men to teach me 'bout girls and religion\nMade my own rendition of grindin' and kissin'\nWeekend calls to my Dad I'd listen\nStill I felt distant, distant like love\nThere's only so far that words could really hug\nDidn't wanna be a thug, older niggas I banged with\nI learned a lot from them cuts in the basement\nThe smell of blunts laced with a little bit of spice\nWise, high niggas, giving me advice\nWe go out and start fights, scuff up our Nikes\nCome back to talk crap and shoot a little dice\nThis is a slice of life and memories\nSittin' in my mind vividly, often they visit me\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nOh baby\nDa-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da (Oh, oh)\nI'm just tryna find a way to understand (I'm tryna understand)\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nHow do I rewind the tape and live in it? (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\nStayin' out late and playin' in Wonderland (Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh)\nIs it in God's plan?\nI'm just tryna find my way to understand it\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nMetaphors can't explain how far I came\nA young man at work, I made my own lane\nSteered away from pain, relied on drive\nThere's a old saying, \"Don't cry, survive\"\nAs I kept building there were cranes in the sky\nCertain memories my brain would deny\nA tear laid in my eye, I was afraid to reply\nTo the hurt that was callin', it came from the sky\nAn older play cousin, of course I trust him\nBut he was touchin' where he wasn't supposed to be touchin'\nWhat's a kid supposed to do?\nWhen they goin' through, what I was goin' through\nDon't know who to go to\nYou want to tell somebody\nIn many ways, I failed somebody\nThat somebody was me\nNow I'm talking to little Rasheed\nIncarcerated heart, man, you gotta be free\nI felt it, when I told my man I would help with\nThings he was dealin' with I really hadn't dealt with\nEmotions meltin', I began to release it\nThings you can't change, you could come to peace with\nAt least get it better for the children of forever\nI read the Lord's letter, I forgive our debtors\nThey don't talk about it, maybe sharing their story\nMemories of home, shared pain and glory\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nOh baby\nDa-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da (Oh, oh)\nI'm just tryna find a way to understand (I'm tryna understand)\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nHow do I rewind the tape and live in it? (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\nStayin' out late and playin' in Wonderland (Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh)\nIs it God's plan?\nI'm just tryna find my way to understand it\n\n[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nSaid I'm tryna understand, understand, understand, understand\nAyy-hey, oh-oh, oh"

What they claiming?\nGonna make an old man get his shoes out\nAnd throw one down to slam dunk on them\nEvery time the leaves start turning brown getting through the fall of the year\nI can say yea it\u2019s time to play some\nWhat these youngsters talking about, they running out of breath?\nWhat you say?\nWell I tell what, we\u2019re gonna try something brand new here\nCause everybody like new things\nWe\u2019re gonna work on something new, and I\u2019m gonna call it \u2018peace\u2019\nWe\u2019re gonna pretend like its 6 years old\nAnd we gonna build it and mould it\nAnd nurture it and culture it\nAnd grow right into our society for all of us to have\nDo you believe in the peace?\nNot that piece, but do you believe in the peace?\nAlright, I see you raising your hand - you believe in the peace\nOK, bring it\nSee if I can\u2019t talk common sense into them\nLet\u2019s cruise on down to 47 St. where dad used to hang out at, you know?\nEh remember in a few years when we moved from 47 to 87\n47 was my hood, 87 was his\nTouchdown\nWhat\u2019s the name of the bangers in this town now?\nHas everybody calmed down?\nBack in my day, they was showing up, now they finally woke up\nI hear they leaving it alone\nUsing words like 'truce', I love to hear that"

Kelly\nBut then they fall off, dusted niggas is gettin sawed off\nThey fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off\nI kick ass\n\n[Chorus]\nI can feel the funk"

Don't lie to me, man, just tell me why!\n-It's the money, alright?\n-Just tell me why!\n-It's the fucking money, alright??\n(Fight noises)\n\n[Outro: Q-Tip]\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit"

Man, that nerve of the ho not to give me no pussy... Come up in my house trying to watch movies and shit... this ain't no motherfuckin' cinema, bitch! Who the fuck she thought I --\nSay, brother, I wasted a evening. I shoulda went with you. But, oh, well. You know I gets my pussy anyway. You know that's how players do. But God-damnit, Rashid, that big-ass bitch-- *laughs*\nIf you'd have said to spread on that ho, man, I could kick my own ass\nWell, should go to work... Just another wasted night\nAnd ohhhh, ohhhh... Heyyy, heyyy... What can you say?"

Yeah\nThe war is on, who you fighting for?\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nIt's like funk to rhythm and punk to rock\nLoud like shot that come from a Glock\nPick up your mind, run from the spot\nRevolution jumping in the parking lot\nShit is so hot, that the sun watch\nChildren by the window with the gun cocked\nThey cooking the raw to start to lump knots\nMonkeys dance around for MTV spots\nI lock into a- (scratches)\nRock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom\nExperiment in stereo loud so crank the system\nFor the humble on the path, I paint a vision\nHow far will a nigga go just for attention\nAnd to be remembered? You forgot the mission\nListen!\n\n[Hook: Laetitia Sadier & Common]\nAll traces of life, in our guts we carry\nThat's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!)\nAll things I yearn for, you need per sanity\nThat reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!)\nClean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be\nThe times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!)\nThis life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous\nBefore it likely ever ends (come on, come on!)\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nI lay terror in this era like Che Guevera\nFor the people to make or wait is better\nIn a room called real, I stay forever\nEveryday I lose something, I gain forever\nMeditate on how I can change the weather\nMy brainstorm for some is like planes, umbrella\nWhere bullets and lies both spray together\nMy mind scream like Al Green \"Let's Stay Together\"\nHow could a nigga be so scared of change?\nThat's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange\nY'all rich, we could beef curry in the game\nOut your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name\nYou seen what happened when the Com go bang\nWouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range\nSeen hype become fame against the grain become main\nStream, it all seems mundane in the scope of thangs\n\n[Hook: Laetitia Sadier & Common]\nAll traces of life, in our guts we carry\nThat's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!)\nAll things I yearn for, you need per sanity\nThat reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!)\nClean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be\nThe times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!)\nThis life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous\nBefore it likely ever ends (come on, come on!)\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nFrom a land of shit talk, porn stars and pitchforks\nDidn't really see white until I went North\nGetting bent off in backyards\nWishing in the air for a black god\nWhere the people fix cars and clap hard\nAnd look to the stars for rap jobs\nI walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots\nSmelling war near, I'm connected with the troops\nThat master anger, it ain't afraid to shoot\nThrough poured liquor, fallen angels they salute\n(Whew! Whew!) Feel the wind blow\nA new wave, people with they hair trimmed low\nIt's two ways living in this world of techno\nThis new age can't really save the ghetto\nI pause for the rebels, who rock heavy metals\nAnd tell them that they pharaoh so let go\nCome on!\n\n[Hook: Laetitia Sadier & Common]\nAll traces of life, in our guts we carry\nThat's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!)\nAll things I yearn for, you need per sanity\nThat reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!)\nClean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be\nThe times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!)\nThis life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous\nBefore it likely ever ends (it's the new wave, come on!)\n\n[Outro: Common]\nCome on!\nCome on!\nCome on!\nCome on!"

If you ain't got no basketball in your hand and wanna shoot it out, you gotta go somewhere else\n\n[Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's \"Move Me No Mountain\"] (x2)\nI don't expect you to be something you're not\nAll I expect you to give is all you got\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nYo, yo, check it\nUnattached and calm, sundaes and pills I palm\nWith intentions to make it to the league\nIntrigued by two-letter cars, SE's and GS'ses\nOn the court, niggas I leave like messages\nPlagued by this ball-player exorcist\nIt's sort of foul how the world be reffin' us\nKenny is our Moses in this five-on-five Exodus\nFor the game of life, full courts ain't preppin' us\nSchools want me, but the ghost of Manigault haunts me\nPlus they wanna crib me, way out in the country\nI'm city like street lights and some games that be fights\nNever worked on my left so it's hard to be right\nEither rich, poor, or Mike is who I wanna be like\nStory of many black males that I refuse to rewrite\n\n[Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's \"Move Me No Mountain\"] (x2)\nI don't expect you to be something you're not\nAll I expect you to give is all you got\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nYo, brothers opinions is Bias-ed, like Len\nThat I'll end up like Ben... Wilson\u2014still, some pretend to be friends\nBeneath the grin, I see the jinn spoke of in the Surah\nMore so than my soul, my jumper is purer\nPeople play juror.  I witness the fall of legends\nOnce was the joint\u2014now they resin.  Got a God-given present\nMy gallant talent is like a magic\nTrick turned by a chick with a bad habit\nOpportunity to move, I grab it\nMe and my moms had static.  Now I reek Hennessy and havoc\nMan to man talks with Kenny send me to a zone\nBeen on my own for so long, my vocal tone's grown\nCompetition gets blown like speakers\nWhen I cross her like Jesus out of bleachers, broads, and beepers\nYeah I boogey it's all good, but it could be better\nWant to stay eighteen forever\nBut now I stay on point like Rod in this Strickland\nIf Brooklyn courts was a campus, then I would be the big man\n\n[Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's \"Move Me No Mountain\"] (x2)\nI don't expect you to be something you're not\nAll I expect you to give is all you got\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nFrom thoughts that pennies bring, I assemble teams like the Kenny Kings\nThink fast over breaks, dialect I'm dribbling\nRemembering night posters of Moses and the Supreme Court\nRealizing that rap and life are team sports\nI follow these thoughts\nMoves never receive thought, lyrical Johnny Cochran\nCause of the way I free thought\nThe system make a nigga think to make it that he need sports\nOr either to the tip he gotta resort\nMy seed'll be taught to start his own in the George Carter zone\nDon't wanna be a dope MC living in his momma's home\nOr speaking to my fans in a starving artist tone\nUnknown zones I roam with mind architecture\nSpark the lecture, emphasizing: let God direct ya\n\n[Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's \"Move Me No Mountain\"] (x4)\nI don't expect you to be something you're not\nAll I expect you to give is all you got"

Ho nigga, respect the game\nI talked to cab drivers about the fast lane\nAnd Islam, masters and chakras and beyond\nThink about the hustle and somehow I see by\nWrote a letter to the concrete, P.S. we strong\nYou was at your hardest when you didn't even try\nLive like a bitch, to bitch you gon' die\n\n[Hook: Common & Sonny Sondoval]\nElectric!

Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric!

   "lyrics": "This is a U-A rhyme, dedicate to the ca-nine\nTch-a-ch-tchk, c'mere boy, I said it's play-time\nIt's time to play with the mind of a slimmie\nI don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me\nI don't pretend to be the open door roses type\nI open the door for myself, and I close it right\nIn your face, now you wanna taste my food, what?\nYou got your own food, get a attitude\nYou get left, call the ref if you think it's foul\nI ain't tryin to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile\nCause after awhile, I'mma wanna get BUCKwild\nAnd now months laters, I'mma say it ain't my child\nI'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin\nCause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin\nLittle Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces\nSorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces\nThat's how I'm livin, just like a rottweiler\nWhen I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder\nBut then I got milder, and settled down with a harem\nAnd when I can't bear em, I share em\nYou see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss\nI ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH\nSo cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul\nForget the grindin shit, I ain't tryin to get the blueball\nBrrrrrrrrap bump me child, I'm speakin upon the nitty gritty\nI'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY\n\n..\n\nZippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day\nUnzip your zipper baby, and come my way\nI'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper\nCause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker\nSo come one friend, come two friend, come all\nUnited we stand, divide your legs so I can fall\nIn your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very\nThick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry\nTom and Jerry (WHAT?) A Woody Woodpecker\nYou need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker\nIntersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum\nI manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb\nIf you got some, just an eensy BIT of game\nThen it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame\nI shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally\nTell em that I get the drawers come off immediately\nHere comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut\nAnd be that I'm a mutt -- so what?\nNo but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to\nIt's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin\nDown the street, watchin ladies\nNobody's watchin you, because you got a baby\nI ain't tryin to be a stepfather so I don't bother\nWord to mommy dearest, I look farther\nDown the road, to a road not taken\nI'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care\nA new flower, so Joe can take a shower\nAnd get wet, and then jet\nLike ahhhh, seven-forty-seven\nI tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven\nThen I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear\n\"Is Common there?\" Uh-uh, sorry\nYou got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack\nChoppin down the cherry tree and never comin back\nIt's like that and it'll be like that\nBecause a dog is a woman's best friend black"

I understand I'm finna' be a grandfather\nAnd I'm so proud\nI can say that in many ways, I can say I'm so happy, I'm so proud\nYou know? Son I wanna give you, you know?\nAny direction in parenting at this stage\nBecause I think it's gonna come to you, just like it came to me\nSee you came to me and your mom from the spiritual world\nWe're just the physical parents, you know?\nGod loaned you to us, as God's spirit\nWe're the physical parents, you know?\nLike I say, I'm not gonna give you no directions, you know?\nBut, I know when you started teaching me\nSee we talk about the life and education of one Lonnie Lynn\nI think I'm the one that got taught, I do believe that, son, you know?\nAnd I know when you started teaching me too\nYou know, I was hanging out, mad at the world\nMy professional basketball career was over\nAnd I didn't believe in the red, white and blue anymore\nAnd I was dissipatin' heavily, I wasn't experimentin', you know?\nAnd one morning you looked across the table at me, it was like \"What? Whatchu' gon' be? Whatchu' gon' do?\nYou got the responsibility to teach me the right things\nYou got the responsibility to teach me truth and respect and love, and safety\"\nYou know? And my knees started gettin' a little stronger, you know?\nI said, cause I can't get past these eyes man, it's just the eyes of a babe looking at me\nAnd I couldn't look it off, I couldn't even play it off, you know?\nAnd immediately I started gettin' the road maps seein' like how am I gon' do this?\nI had to thank The Almighty for the strength, that he sent to me through you\nSo, I'm here to say, you know, thank you son\nI'm here to say I'm so proud and numerous other things\nCause you've been a teacher to me, just like, I have supposed to be a teacher to you\nCause a lot of people think that parenting and raising a child is a one way street\nBut, you taught me continuous numerous lessons\nAnd I love you my son"

No I ain't a murderer\nI'm Jake the Rake, yo sorry if I'm hurtin the\nVaginal area, fallopian tubes and your cervix\nI strongly recommend that for your gen' you get some Jergens\nI find it beneficial; not to force the issue\nI just blow my shit and wipe you see a head it's like tissue\nUse em and throw em away, see a ho a day is essential\nIf you want a piece of the rock, trick, go to Prudential\nCause I rock a buyer babe on the treetop\nAnd when the wind blows, my dick'll get hard, the cradle will rock\nI'm like the peacock on NBC, Nuttin But Cock\nI pump, prrrrrrrrrrrump pump it up yo, like a Reebok\nHey, I don't sell junk, but I'm a Junkyard Dog\nAnd when I Duke it's a Hazzard, so call me Boss Hog\nOr Roscoe P.

Am I the supplier?\nAm I rich? Do I have any buyers?\nOnce they realized that they couldn't move an inch us\nThat's when they divide and try to Willie Lynch us\nSaid that my guy said it was my shit\nOh I'mma fall for that (?) shit?\nC'mon man I'm from a Chi environment\nExercise my right to stay silent\nSmoking Bob Marley but I ain't gonna wail out\nOr sing to the cops man, no sell out"

Period is in the house\nKanye, he's in the house\nG.O.O.D. Music, we in the house\nJ. Dilla, he's in the house\nYo, The Roots they in the house\nKristen Mills is in the house\n\nI had a dream, a dream since I was a kid\n\n\"They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me\"\n\"I met this girl when I was ten years old\nAnd what I loved most, she had so much soul\""

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Various Speakers]\n- What is a beautiful revolution?\n- A beautiful revolution\n- A beautiful revolution is when old and outdated ideas are replaced by new and better ones\n- Everybody's in peace, everybody's shaking hands\n- A beautiful revolution? The Earth going around the Sun, it's a beautiful thing\n- The truth is, revolution can be small. It's in the stillness, and it can be painful and warm because it's happening on the inside first. It can't happen out there unless it's happening in here\n- A beautiful revolution is a truthful revolution, a revolution that balances the extremes of, of inner and outer, light and dark, good and evil, masculine, feminine, black, white\n- People were able to change other peoples' minds without any loss of life and without any shedding of blood\n- That's a beautiful revolution\n- That's, that's what a beautiful revolution looks like to me\n\n[Outro: Morgan Parker]\nAnd finally, we take us back, The boat and the big house, my body, my thoughts, our words, our fate, my people, our peace, my people. Come, sit down for a spell. We gather to announce our freedom, unafraid to turn our backs, and we can bring you. And nobody wants us dead. And we are free to rest and tend our wounds. Give us this day to grieve who we could've been. Give us this day to bless the Atlantic floor, to worship what was stolen. Give us more than survival. Weave fists, glistening with Blue Magic and Black Glory. Only roses in our mouths. We pray like this. We keep us safe. We can breathe. We give us breath. And we is us again. Amen"

   "lyrics": "Yo, we all got different things we got to deal with. we always are trying\nTo put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at\nOurselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens...but if we look\nWithin ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense. it's about\nRelating back to the essence, where it all stems from. i'm-a do my thing\nOver this drum, like a native tongue\n\nVerse one\nQ-tip:\nDo what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real\nComplicated with the skills over reel to reel\nBrown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal\nIs to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill\nConstantly, I'm hearing black americans just sneering\nLooking for a leader who can fill us up with either\nHitting us up with great emotional chat\nAbout the fact\nThat the black\nIs constantly held back\nLike 50 tracks back in a relay race\nAnd the white team's ahead\nSo let's keep up the pace\nAnd I be needing something\nTo feed my logical taste\nAt the end of the race is there a paradise place?\nYo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing\nMaterial gain we put too much in persuing\nYo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party\nBut we can all mardi grati\nMinus that shit in our body\nWhat that got to do with that\n'cause kid that's the essence\nYour physical presence\nEmbodies every lesson\nYou can't run the rolls royce if the engine is busted\nCan't even life the knife to cut the mustard\nWhat we need to do first\nNow listen to this verse\nLet's concentrate on our spiritual plate\nRecognize your existence in this vast blue space\nFrom a tiny cloud of blood\nTo the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell\nAnd sound\nLet's deem it profound!\nAnd prioritize this cause it was allah's wish\nAllah? I'm god\nNo I ddon't believe that. that's a mystery\nIf God is so good why does shit be happening to me?\nThere's divinity within\nBecause we come from the divine\nA froce that's not seen but you feel it every time\nWhen the wind blows, and the world turns\nAnd the rain drops, and the baby cries\nAnd the bird flies, and the ground quake\nAnd the stars gleam\nSo many things are eident of it's existence\nWhat we need to do is link it with persistence\nOnce we recognize that, we can move ahead\nNative tongue, common sense yo he's hip-hop bred...\n\nCommon:\nFrom the spiritual world my former life has developed\nFirst person I lost close to me was stella\nSome of my mellows\nLost their mothers and their brothers\nFor them I feel empathy\nBut I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas\nI pour my heart out when I see dot out on the deck\nKnowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death\nI hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news\nBut when it's somebody you know it hits you\nAnd emotions get bruised\nI ain't been in your shoes\nI won't judge you for knocking\nBecause the spirit of the ghetto says you gotta!\nThey snatch you again from rock flippin'\nGive back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'\nStickin' stores\nOn the strip\nI'm tired of arabs giving me my change back\nDevil bomb my yesterday\nMy tomorrow he never gave back\nI lay back, looking at the ceiling\nWonndering what can I do\nSo my homie won't have to be dealing\nNot cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better\nJust different pieces to the puzzle of black life\nThat we have to put together, better ourselves\nCause families we gotta raise\nNo matter how long the money\nShorter become the days\nMen become like women\nAnd no difference in the season\nIf you got popped five times\nYou breathing for a reason\nLet's put the five tenure plan into progression\nBefore we count our paper\nCount our blessings"
