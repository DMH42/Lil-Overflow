They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).\n\nAs a result of spending money carelessly, Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.\n\nThe show was successful and began his acting career. Smith has since gone on to become one of the most well-known and highest paid actors in the world."

I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya\nWe're your first, last and only line of defense\nAgainst the worst scum of the universe\nSo don't fear us, cheer us\nIf you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless\nMiBs, freezin' up all the flack\n(What's that stand for?) Men in Black\n\n[Bridge: Will Smith & Coko]\nUh, and\nThe Men in Black\nUh, and\nThe Men in Black\nLet me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me (bounce with me)\nJust bounce it with me c'mon\nLet me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me (slide, slide, slide, slide)\nJust slide with me c'mon\nLet me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me (walk with me)\nTake a walk with me c'mon\nAnd make your neck work\nNow freeze (uh huh huh ha)\n\n[Chorus: Coko]\nHere come the Men in Black (Men in Black)\nGalaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)\nHere come the Men in Black (Men in Black)\nThey won't let you remember (no, no)\n\n[Verse 3: Will Smith]\nAlright check it, let me tell you this in closin'\nI know we might seem imposin'\nBut trust me if we ever show in your section\nBelieve me, it's for your own protection\n'Cause we see things that you need not see\nAnd we be places that you need not be\nSo go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap\nShow love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in\nThat's the Men in\n\n[Chorus: Coko]\nHere come the Men in Black (here they come)\nGalaxy defenders (galaxy defenders)\nHere come the Men in Black (oh, here they come)\nThey won't let you remember (won't let you remember)\nHere come the Men in Black (ohh, here they come)\nGalaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)\nHere come the Men in Black\nThey won't let you remember"

I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning\n\n[Verse 1]\nDance, an afrodesiac\nWomen gyrating, simulating sensual acts\nTo stimulatin musical tracks\nI thought I was just gon' come out at night and get a brew and relax\nBut no! Uh-uh, when you the party starter\nIt's like, you on call, you what the doctor ordered\nIt's like you gotta block the border to the door and\nShock 'em when it's boring, get on the floor!\nUhh, it's the groovicide bomber\nMic in my vest tight, strapped to my chest like\nI'm a run up in the party holla and\nBe like, oh! Fulfilling my calling\nBig, Will, that's my name\nWriting, rhymes, that's my game\nAsk me again and I'll tell you the same\nLook, just write your number right next to your name girl\n\n[Hook]\nOhh! I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was raised in the days when the roof was raised and\nEvery rap occasion, new and amazing\nThe back of the stage is amazed and gazing\nPraying for the day they can one day praise him\nStudied the ways of the game and made it\nCame through the maze and the haze and played it\nPerfect, dazed any person hated\nAnd cursed 'em, he was unfazed, he waited\nIt was worth it, he never retaliated\nHe saved it, slaving, on the road blazing\nDazed when he was low, nothing could raise him\nAnd came to the show and something uncaged in him\nLike the pope of this party crusade\nI'm like braids, that's never gon' fade, ya heard?\nI'm like, 23's on an Escalade\nThrow me into the rave like you threw a grenade, boom!\n\n[Hook]\nOhh! I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning\n\n[Verse 3]\nI call for the days of the unadulterated\nWhen the artistry was cultivated\nYou know back when rap was smart and multi-layered\nWe can rap without A&R's and ultimatums, damn!\nNow today I say the praise, I long for the good old days\nWhen the party was all about partying\nI was a mini-party starter then\nMy mind bends when I call my pen\nThe big question, should I run to mine a vittle\nFood for thought or, dumb the rhyme a little?\nBut Will if you come too high\nThat'll alienate folks, and they won't buy it\nYo, look, people getting trapped in the track\nAnd they be clapping, even when the rappin is wack\nAnd what happened? When did we get happy with that?\nHe old-fashioned? Yup! Well let's be happy he back, ya heard me?\n\n[Hook]\nOhh! I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning"

Blige]\nSouls are captured (souls are captured)\nDreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)\nHearts are broken (hearts are broken)\nEvil plaguin he rewardin\nHate surrender (hate surrender)\nLove exaulted! (Love exaulted!)\nHOPE ELATED! (HOPE ELATED!)\nNegativity DESTROYED AND..\n\n[Verse Two: Will Smith]\nHonest to God, why is the bomb always gettin the last word\nAnd why, did her uncles have to molest her\nAnd why, did all them cops have to be shootin to kill?\nAnd why, did all them priests have to act so ill?\nTell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?\nTell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us\nTell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot\nAnd why, is human life always denied for loot?\nTell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage\nWhy did my brother Sterling have to die at that age\nTell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate\nAnd why the {bleep} can't love, seem to defeat hate?\nTell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?\nWhy did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?\nTell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?\nPlease, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say\n\n[Hook]\nI really wish I could explain it baby\nIt's just the world is kinda crazy baby\nAin't no pretty way to paint it baby\nDon't cry, dry your eyes\nI really wish I could explain it baby\nIt's just the world is kinda crazy baby\nAin't no pretty way to paint it baby\nDon't cry, dry your eyes\n\n[Verse Three: Will Smith]\nCan't explain it baby life is just really crazy\nI mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby\nWe got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy\nYou live four scores and still it be drivin you crazy\nBut for me I try to see the bright side\nSometimes it be like the goodness be tryin to hide\nOr tryin to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside\nSweetie you be the light for others, make 'em believe in God\n\n[Interlude]"

Omar\nCarry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\n[Verse 3: Left Eye]\nIt's Left Eye with a tight crew\nRepresenting like it's ladies night\nComing right through\nDon't be spiteful\nPlus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink\nRocks in the link, In the drop with a mink\nLike my- don't stink\nGot you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam\nBlowing up spots then running off with the pot\nLeft Eye ready for action\nThe main attraction\nI'm in the fast lane passing\nBreaking you down like fractions\nWhile we be rapping about things that really happen\nBig willie style Philly style let's make it platinum\nWith Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace\nWith a sweet smell\nThis female leading the posse\nGot jokes like Cosby\nIn the lots where the cars be\nWith no apologies it's Left Eye\nBig Will, let the champagne spill\nIs it a man's thing for real?\nCan us girls roll wit y'all\nWhat the deal?\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\n[Verse 4: Will Smith]\nWell now it's looking like a car show\nConvoys and whips on the strip\nPulling up in the six making brothers sick\nFor real\nBig Will household name, Entertainer\nGold handle cane and matching gators\nSwerving lane\nIn pole position rolling deep like a coalition\nIn soul position and can rock a whole convention\nMovie screens to the club scene\nMy whole crew looking clean\nShine with a diamond gleam\nStep above where the players be\nDon't hate me\nOne is where they rate me\nLately you could find me\nBehind the door marked V.I.P\nEating grapes under the A.C\nBig willie style is how we do it\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\n[Outro]\nThis one goes out to all the big willies"

That was my intention\nI paid dues, now dudes pay attention\nI live for it, even though the flicks is hittin\nCrib's sick, you can see the booth from the kitchen\nSpeak on it, cause I saw it happen\nThis is hip-hop, dawg I ain't just rappin\nY'all lookin at a real MC man\nYou couldn't check a mic from me\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nWhy should I try to sound like y'all sound?\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nWhy should I try to flow, the way y'all flow\nOr do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now\nY'all in the hip-hop lost and found\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nMan it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns\nWith a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around\n\n[Verse Two: Will Smith]\nLet's talk about rhyme capability\nLet's talk about hip-hop versatility\nLet's talk about takin the game beyond\nHow the hell we gon' have a battle of wits? Trick you unarmed\nLet's talk about love for the game\nI mean real love, back before there was fame\nI'm real with it, I ain't claimin to reign\nBut when y'all talk about rap, y'all gon' start sayin my name\nF'real though, I ain't playin\nPlenty of y'all love a brother, just scared to say it\nYo, first ever rap Grammy\nLet's talk about the only reason yo' ass went to Miami - yup!\nTruck with rims - check; throwback jersey - check\nChampagne bottles - check; lots of models - DAMN!\nThat's the list for 90% of y'all videos and songs\nAm I WRONG?!\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nWhy should I try to sound like y'all sound?\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nWhy should I try to flow, the way y'all flow\nOr do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now\nY'all in the hip-hop lost and found\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nMan it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns\nWith a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around\n\n[Verse Three: Will Smith]\nLost - when you a slave to the biz\nWith no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids\nFound is when your lyrics are a test of time\nAnd your mind hear that your spirit is blessed divine\nLost is when you rhyme 'til your throat gets sore\nBut you don't even believe what you say no more\nFound is when you bleed heart into the mic\nAnd the pain you sustain it could change a life\nLost is when you hide behind the freedom of speech\nWell sure you're free to do it, but what it mean to do it\nDid you mean to do it? Did you need to do it?\nDid you take time to think about the seed you ruined?

And can't wait to tell\nIf I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell\n\n[Verse One: Will Smith]\nYo, I've been down with Jesus since Sunday school and Easter speeches\nThe, bible was survival that's what my grandma would teach us\nSince I was 5 I've been dyin and tryin to read it\nAnd when I did, it redefined it\nNow you was 34 when you found Jesus after your life fell to pieces\nWife two times with two guys, now enlightened the speeches\nSeem to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher\nTook your whole life to reach ya, now I'm a triflin creature?\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nMs. Holy Roller, new angel\nWit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell\nMid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell\nIf I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell\n\n[Will Smith]\nC'mon, if I die right this second, I reckon that God\nWould simply check into my life and times, dissectin my rhymes\nHe'll see how I've been leadin his troops\nYou can't do dirt your whole life and say - OOPS!\n\n[Interlude: Will Smith]\nNow where was Jesus when you was cheatin and you was deceivin me?\nWhere was Jesus when you was greedy, your lawyers was bleedin me?\nWhere was Jesus when every weekend, a new man was livin wit'chu\nOh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin you!\nNow where was Jesus when you was lyin and you was betrayin me?\nWhen I was tryin to make it and you was hatin delayin me huh?\nWhere was Jesus when the ICE was thrillin ya?\nOh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin ya!\n\n[Verse Two: Will Smith]\nIf I ain't know Jesus, ain't no tellin where we'd be\nIt's been nights I felt like beasts, I needed to fight to release it\nI'm in the limelight, it's hot and the heat is ceaseless and\nHoldin my tongue while lil' bums cut me to pieces\nThe only reason's cause I studied the life of Jesus and\nVentin with my pen and intendin to write and release it\nBut when an ex-friend slight me and slam me pretendin\nI hate it, I can't stand, damn it I really resent it\nI always strive to be righteous, my version of God\nThe reason why I never write rap verses with curses inside\nThe reason I never purposely hurt person I've replied\nMany teachers of God, searchin to reach as a God\nPondered the mysteries of why you be dissin me\nI adore you, all I hope for you is freedom from mysery\nYou made mistakes and blunders, you breakin from under but yo\nIf I'm goin to hell, it's makin me wonder\n\n[Interlude: Will Smith]\nThe greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the name of God\nThis country was founded by the Puritans for the express purpose of oppressin free worship\nYour attitude is the same arrogant fearful fundamentalism\nThat fueled the hatred, of the Crusades and the attacks of 9/11\nIf we are not allowed to worship God as groups and individuals free from persecution\nAnd respect for tolerance, there's only one outcome\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nMs. Holy Roller, new angel\nWit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell\nMid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell\nIf I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell, yo\nMs. Holy Roller, new angel\nWit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell\nMid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell\nIf I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell"

Then the less you do, the better\nCause women equate dance with sex\nThey gon' see you, and be like - next\nBut you gon' be like, hold up ma! - next\nBut she gon' be like, uh-uh pah! - next\nNow looka here, rule number one, know your name\nIt ain't Usher, Justin, Hammer? Then we can touch ya\nRule number two, never do a dance you can't do\nWhy stupid? You can't do it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Will Smith]\nSo I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night right\nAnd this dude out on the floor OD'n, just way overdancin\nYou know so his mami wanna holla at me\n\n[Verse Two: Will Smith]\nShe thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie\nShe said she watched my TV show and I was very silly\nTold her I was from Philly, she looked at me said really?\nAnd judgin from her t-shirt I could tell that she was chilly\nSo I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta\nShe said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta\nShe said she glad I met her, let's go somewhere together\nShe said she'd ride in my car, cause she knew my car was better\nThe conversation cookin, attention gettin tooken\nMy Spidey Sense is tinglin, I felt somebody lookin\nNow who this brother lookin, and now he runnin bookin\nI'm mad I'm like the fisherman I almost had my hook in\nI figured I should get up, and quickly clear my head up\nRosetta got a man, got me feelin kinda set up\nNow dude was really fed up, and yo he wouldn't let up\nHomey if I hit you you might never ever get up\nNow he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome\nComin like Mel Gibson like I had his girl from ransom\nPedro wanna go outside\nYo amigo, tranquilo, slide\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Will Smith]\nNow rule number three is easy\nPlease re-member that you ain't on Beach Street\nThe sweet beat you ain't tryin to win no TV\nAnother dude get a move no need to outdo it\nRule number four, out on the floor\nDon't be doin moves that don't nobody do no more\nDraw too much attention it be adventureous on the floor\nThere's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?\nThis may be hilarious\nBut rule number five is SERIOUS, uh\nIt's a shame to even have to discuss\nBut it's no lip bitin or pelvic thrusts, I mean\nYou think that move'll put the sting on her?\nYou too close, tryin to put a ring on her?\nYou don't know that girl, don't cling on her\nAnd don't put your thing on her, cool?\n\n[Hook]"

What? What? What?\n\n[Will Smith]\nIt's the fun king, I've been doing one thing\nRunning things for years, give me one swing\nAnd it's out of here, crack!\nOver the fence ladies and gents\nKeeping rappers impressed but depressed by my current events\n[Kim]\nYes Lord!\n[Will]\nBig Will swinging the best sword\nWhat'cha flexing for, don't be testing me boy\nMessing with me boy, you're stepping on the root of a daisy\nI have you're girl saying\n[Kim]\nWill why you do that to my baby?\nYo Will, what they looking stupid in the face for?\nWhat? I can't have rocks the size of a baseball\nTrust me when I cop I make sure mine cut glass\nNever spend my last, like a crack head for the blast\nY'all can kiss my ass acting like you know me\nYou ain't got a Rolley, take this one here you owe me\nAll in together now, wrists looking better now\nScrew greyhound bound, I'm getting cheddar now\n[Will]\nBurrrr! When she step up in the scene!\nWho! Ice gleam, y'all scream, \"Bow to the Queen!\"\nRing on her finger mad phat\nLeonardo DiCaprio saw it and caught a flashback\n*mouth noise*\nAll you rappers wanna snap, Jazzy Jeff got my back\n*mouth noise*\nLil' Kim bring it back, Lil' Kim press the rack\n[Lil' Kim]\nYeah I'm short and sexy, my love's divine\nMy name is QB and I blow your mind with the\n*mouth noise*\nWhen I step up, body lookin' hot\nAll the music just stop"

It hurt me at first, but it's cool\nTook the insults feed it to my ego used it for fuel\nNow everywhere I turn a dead end\nHundred women coming at me waving pads and pens\nAnd they be screaming out, \"Oh my lord!\nDid you see it's that brother from ID4?\"\n\"Now, can I please get (a picture and your signature?)\" \"Sure you can, miss\"\n\"Oh my god, my girlfriends, they ain't gonna believe this!\"\nWorldwide, wait! Nah, hold up, galactic\nHear my name, don't nothing change but the accent\nBangok to Madagascar, they wanna see me\nPrince epe in Spain; Japan, I'm cota eshe\nI like my steaks thick and my jets private\nAnd my son to ride in the cockpit\nI know he's only four, taking lessons from the pilot\nWhile I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips\nFind a magazine and I read the hottest gossip\nMan, who'd've thought my life would be such an interesting topic?\nWell y'all know how it is, wait, hold up, y'all don't!\nWell look here, y'all don't say nothing, then I won't\n\n[Hook]\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)\n\n[Verse 3]\nGo ahead, adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers\nMake sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters\nI'm about to show you how a man like me works\nShorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper\nFour five chromed out former two seater\nFifty inch Sony to watch Siskel and Ebert\n'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs, ten toes\nOne knee and probably a couple of elbows\n'Cause yo, I'm the man and the whole world knows\nRock film festivals and rap shows\nAll the critics jealous people and back-stabbers\nMy so-called friends, who been nothing but actors\nYou're way outta character, but now, who's the bomb?\nIt's Will from West Phil', just slightly transformed\nY'all know what it is\nAh damn, that's right, y'all don't!\nBut look here, y'all don't say nothing, then trust me, I won't!\n\n[Hook]\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)\nJust don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)"

Dude's resilient\nFresh Prince was hot, the movies killed him\nWait, hold up, STOP! You can rebuild him\nLock him back in hip-hop while dude's not filmin'\nShocked by the film and the TV money\nWent from scenes with Uncle Phil to scenes with Sonny\nIt's so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20\nBut it's done, so come see the MC honey!\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nHere he comes, he can rock\nHe can breakdance and he can pop\nHe can rap, and he can act\nAnd if it come down to it he can scrap\nHey there, here come Big Will again\n\n[Bridge: Will Smith]\nEvery time he touch the mic\nHe close his eyes and he hope to shine\nAnd like a streak of light\nIntro his name, they be like \"ahhhh!\"\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nHere he comes, he can rock\nHe can breakdance and he can pop\nHe can rap, and he can act\nAnd if it come down to it he can scrap\nHey there, here come Big Will again\n\n[Outro: Will Smith]\nHere come Big Will again\nHere come Big Will again!"

You ask\nThe guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz\nIn the past cut twice by the ladies of my life\nBoom stitched up by my wife\nWho am I?\nIt's suffice to say found gold in my heart\nPut the ice away\nNicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay\nEven when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day\nWho am I?\nThat brother with the platinum plaque\nWith the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack\nThe fact is that when that brother rap or act\nHold position, front of the pack\nWho am I?\n\n[Tatyana Ali]\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\n\nBaby if you really wanna know about me\nI'll tell you who I am\nI'll tell you I be not the one for games\nBut if you're right with me\nI know I'll do the same\n\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\n(L-Y-T-E)\n\n[MC Lyte]\nWho am I?\nYou dare to ask\nThe same female who hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass\nI'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream\nBreak the bank papi cause we're coming for the cream\nAnd while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe\nHold face, sell a million and you still won't equate\nSo who am I?

Damnit\nTen minutes later standin up in the principles office\nGetting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking\nAnd he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son\n\"You testing me? You messin up again?\nYou done boy\"\n\n[Hook]\nThis is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game\nA real scary story\nWent from rags to riches it got goblins in it haters and witches. Uh\n\n[Repeat Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst thing he did was find somebody to give him some money\nHe wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey\nThe guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny\nBut they gave him the money so they played the record company\nIt sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today\nDeals wasn't a dime a dozen\nToday every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal\nBut for real it wasn't like that then\nAs you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was\nHavin Started antagonizing them guy's he was with\nAt the same time he started realizing\nThe deal that he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits\nHe called a meeting to find a solution\nHe said I'm gettin beat out of my loot\nAnd I'm not recording no more until we find a solution\nThe dude said we found a solution it's this .44\nHe ran for the door a little shaken\nBut the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation\nHe said I'm breakin this contract for ya\nHe said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you\nJust do me a favor\nGet your life in order\n\n[Hook]"

Nah man, a piece of me\nBut you can't see it that when you be dancing B\nAs I asked you a question that's how you answer me\nSo when you don't dance it be like I'm choking from cancer\nLike I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive, sure\nI rationalize, like oh I see\nBut if you don't like my cut it's like you don't like me\nSome stuff works, some works, not so well\nIt's like you work like hell, still get hurt like hell\nYo, it can tear you apart\nBut don't let your wins go to your head, your losses go to your heart\nAnd if we ever get the pleasure to meet\nBe clever wit and please measure what you yell in the street, c'mon\n\n[Hook]\nCould you love me in the shack in a shanty town?\nCould you love me if my pants was hand-me-down?\nCould you love me if my wrists ain't bling?\nIf I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?\nCould you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted?\nWill my name be easier to forget it, huh?\nCould you love me if my wrists ain't bling?\nIf I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?"

Listen\nWhatever you do, don't fall asleep\nMan\nJeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff\nLook, I'll talk to you tomorrow\nJeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, answer me"

Period\nThrough life's stress and strife?\"\nShe said: \"Yeah\", he said: \"In that case\nWould you please be my wife?\"\nThen like a sign from the sky, the baby cried\nLike an angel sings\nI love y'all more than anything\n\n[Chorus]\nAfro Angel, born against the world\nYou don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride\nAfro Angel, sent from heaven above\nNever forget that you are loved\nYou know that you are loved\n(Yeaahh, uhhh...)\nAfro Angel, born against the world\nYou don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride\nAfro Angel, sent from heaven above\nNever forget that you are loved\nYou know that you are loved"

Let my girl, girl go\nI try to be tough y'all\nSometimes she make me so mad\nHer eyes like diamonds\nMake me forget she's so bad\nShe's my angel\nThis world she's not of\nSent from the upstairs\nTaught me that new kind of love (Love, love, love)\nI can't tell y'all\nWhat she means in my life\nWhat make it so crazy\nI met her through my wife\nShe got me locked down\nGot me locked, locked down\n\n(Chorus)"

(dat's where the party's at!)\nUuh, D.C. y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)\nA-T-L (dat's where the party's at!)\nWest side! (dat's where the party's at!)\nMid-west y'all (dat's where the party's at!)\nDirty South now (dat's where the party's at!)\nYo, I can't hear y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)\nWhere ever we at! (dat's where the party's at!)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, yo and when the sun drop\nBack in Philly that don't mean that the fun stop\nAll it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on\nAll day long I been plottin' on this nice john\nIt's ten o'clock now Jeff is tryin' to hype me\nWill the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?\nHear the crowd cheer, broguht a little smile out\nMic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out\nI know he's old, but\nMabye it's a slight chance\nI could get my brother hype\nMake him break dance- ha, maybe not\nLemme get the crowd jumpin'\nLet me him 'em with the brand new funk or something\nI'm like Rob Base- I wanna rock right now\nY'all know who run the block right now\nAll we need is a mic and a beat\nAnd a couple of speakers\nAnd some turn tables out in the street, come on!\n\n[Hook]"

We got what you want\nJazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk\nGet down brand new funk-hit it\nIt was kind of an accident, the way that it happened\nOne day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up\nAnd all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said\n\"What the ? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it\"\nHe just smiled and said, \"Yeah def ain't it?\"\nIt was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was\nThe {brand new funk}\nSo we continued to listen to it\nAnd we knew it was def when I started rappin to it\nSo I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette\nI took it home that night, and analyzed it\nRewound the tape over and over, and memorized it\nThat Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up\nYou shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin\nAnd clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on\nThe microphone I was flowin\nFresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, \"Yo keep goin\" So I continued to\nRock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready\nRock\nPeople barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the\nBrand new funk\nGe-Ge-Get down-hit it\nYo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} *\nJazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the\nBeat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands }\nJazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat\nJeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around\nThe most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling\nSensational, stupendous music\nThat has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated\nBut we have done it, so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief\nThis isn't a publicity stunt It's the raw untouched, pure, hard brand new funk\n{Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat}\n{Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your\nHands } {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock\nThe beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with\nYour hands }"

Why they do that?\nThrew back, by the noise\nSome dude and his boys\nYou know them? Your boyfriend?\nMore like an annoyed friend\nPeep through the peephole\nPeeped him and all his peo-ple\nThat's when Charlie creep through\n\"Boy, you wanna see WHO?!\nDon't nobody wanna meet you!\"\nDamn, here come the beef stew\n\"My beef ain't with you (uh-uh), my beef's with Will\nSo, see Mack, ease back, 'fore yo' cap get peeled\"\nCharlie said, \"Any beef with Will is, plenty beef with me\"\nAnd whenever Charlie get mad, he step to the streets he see the...\nEnd of the story, you, wonder who survived?\nGet my \"He's The DJ...\" album, CHECK TRACK FIVE"

Yo, I don't know, care if none of my friends come\nA hat and shades go out and try to blend some, yeah right\nDays off is hard to come by\nEspecially for Hollywood's number one guy\nSo let me get to movin', while the sun is high\nMy cell is off, two-way is off\nIt's yearly crazy, today is gravy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 - Will Smith]\nHalf awake and half asleep\nAs I watch the sun, it slightly moved a little past its peak\nAnd I feel like Tom Hanks but it's perfect, I'm a \"Cast Away\"\nAgenda full of nothin' but stuff to pass today\nMy sister asked me to cook somethin'\nBut that would fall into the category of doin' somethin'\nAnd I done already said to ya'll that I ain't doin' nothin'\nSo let me say it again to be clea,r I ain't doin' nothin'\nHmm, phew, a breather\nI meant what I meant, when I said, when I said it's all leisure\nNeither, chart toppin' crowd pleaser\nPhone rang Jada said, \"Uhh he's uhh,\" I ain't home, so turn that phone off\nCome and sit on my lap, and take a load off\nAnd lay down into my arms, and we could doze off\nTo work as much as I work, I must be thrown off, what a day\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Tra-Knox]\nYo, yo, yo, mic check, mic check\nAh, that's cool\n\n[Will Smith]\nThat's hot right\n\n[Tra-Knox]\nYeah, alright I'm gonna do the umm\n\n[Will Smith]\nHey Ramon help me out dog\n\n[Tra-Knox]\nThis is hot\n\n[Will Smith]\nYo chief, yo Tone, come on\n\n[Hook]\nNothin's on my mind - 25X"

Uh uh, when you're the party starter\nIt's like you're on call, yo're what the doctor ordered\nIt's like you gotta block the borer tothe door\n& shock em when it's boring....\nGET ON THE FLOOR!!\nUH, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest\nTight, strapped to my chest\nLike, I'ma run up in the party hollerin'\n& be like \"Ohhh!\", fulfillin' my callin'\nBig!

And I just woke up\nWalked to the window and opened the shades up\nSun so bright that I can hardly see\nBut I'm a black man\nSo I pass on a tan\nDip to the bathroom take me a shower\nBut first called up my girl told her be ready in an hour\nI was still a bit tired man I'm laggin'\nGrabbed the tooth brush to kil the dragon\nOoh have mercy great day in the morning\nTurn on the water and I'm stretchin' and yawnin'\nTryin' to get a blender to hot with the cold\nMan I'm young but why I feel so old\nGet it just right then step to the mirror\nRubbin' my eyes to make my vision get clearer\nEverything looks a-o. K\nAnd today is gonna be a lovely day\n1 - (a lovely day)\nLovely day\nLovely day\nLovely day\nLovely day\nSo I jet out the crib and hop in the benzo\nToday is my girls day and all of my friends go\nJust me and her top down on the highway\nIf you're gonna do it then why not do it the fly way\nFirst a car wash next the barber shop\nThen off to my girls crib that's my next stop\nA dozen roses a card and candy\nI'm a true mackadocious mr. Romanty\nShe hoped in and she asked where we're goin'\nYo we like a twig in the nile we just flowin'\nMaybe to the beach or maybe hook up a picnic\nBut yo it doesn't matter cause today we just kickin' it\nI threw in my homemade slow tape\nAnd off to the beach for some beautiful landscape\nMan this is a bonafide lovers delight\nGot the ocean on the left the mountains on the right\nI said yeah cause that's the way I was feelin'\nFree as a bird got the clouds for a ceiling\nI wish that I could rest my gas and fly away\nToday has been a lovely day\nRepeat 1\nIt's dark outsid"
