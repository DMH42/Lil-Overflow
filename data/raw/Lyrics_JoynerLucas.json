   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus\nCausing them to move around more frequently\nThey may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors\n\n[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]\nOne time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)\nTwo times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)\nThree times for them hoes on the internet\nShittin' on niggas when they really should get out more\nFour times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)\nFive times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)\nSix times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to\u2014 (Brap, brap, brap)\n\n[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]\nKidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)\nTurn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)\nWalk around the city with a ice pick\nI been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)\nAin't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)\nBeat the police with a nightstick (Boop)\nIn my whole life, I been lifeless\nNow I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo!

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGo ahead and call me a coward\nSay that I'm not strong because I'm not like you\nGo ahead and call me crazy\n'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?\nI think I live in my head\nSometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth\nKnow I been losing my mind\nAnd I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes\n'Cause I've never been happy with myself\nAnd I don't need no one feeling bad for me\nTryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me\nWanna give me advice and then laugh at me\nBehind closed doors, just close the door\nLet me be by myself\u2014just me and myself\nI'm tired of living, I cry\nI hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself\nAnd I know that sounds crazy to everyone else\nBut I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck\nAin't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs\nI mean, I need extra love\nAnd that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough\nAnd where the fuck is God? (God, God)\nDamn, maybe I ain't believing enough\nBut today we gonna see if he's real\nAnd if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell\nLook, I ain't wanna die like this\nI ain't picture my life like this\nThey don't know what it's like like this\nPretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you\nSometimes I wonder if I ever act like you\nCould I finally fit in and maybe relax like, \"Woo!\"\nOr would you feel lost without me?\n'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me\nAnd my mind's spinning, this is the line finish\nTruth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings\nI made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams\nI guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend\nAnd I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit\nOkay, the day I was nine\nI've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire\nGrandma told me I should take it one day at a time\nAnd dammit, look at me now, fuck\nFuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu\u2014, ugh\nLook, just know it's a new day\nBut if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!\n\n[Chorus]\nJust make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry\nBut it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nI don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry\nBut I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nJust make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry\nBut it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nI don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry\nBut I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI hope you got what you wanted\nI hope you finally happy, it's too late for you\nBeen going out of my mind\nYou don't know how many times that I done prayed for you\nI hope you hear me, goddammit\n'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you\nI used to shine, now I'm all in the dark\nI remember I used to tell you to follow your heart\nBut goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault\nHow could you? Maybe it's my fault\nI shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'\nMaybe I should have been more of an influence\nI can't believe that you're dead, I fu\u2013\nI read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it\nBut I'll forever be attached to you (Damn)\nPart of me feels bad for you\nA part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you\nAnd I don't mean to be insensitive\nBut I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit\nYou took the easy way out, goddammit, you did\nI mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset\nHow could you be so selfish?\nNigga, how could you be so selfish?\nNow you're gone, you done left me so helpless\nI wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself\nYo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? (Say for yourself)\nLook, I really feel lost without you\nI hate the fact you think the world is better off without you\nAnd my mind's spinning, this is the line finish\nTruth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings\nAnd I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen\nI know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes\nI just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out\nI'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out\nI wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?\nI wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?\nTell me what death is like\nWas it meant for you, brodie? Did the heaven support it?\nAre you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?\nIsn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling\nAnd you've been suicidal back then you were nine?\nYeah, even back then, you was nine\nWe was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire\nGrandma told us we should take it one day at a time\nAnd damn it, look at you now, shit\nBut it's a new day\nAnd if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck!\n\n[Chorus]\nJust make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry\nBut it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nI don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry\nBut I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nJust make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry\nBut it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nI don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry\nBut I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nJust make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry\nBut it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nI don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry\nBut I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nJust make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry\nBut it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me\nI don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry\nBut I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWith all due respect\nI don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel\nScreamin', \"Black Lives Matter\"\nAll the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills\nYellin', \"Nigga,\" this, and, \"Nigga,\" that\nCall everybody, \"Nigga,\" and get a nigga mad\nAs soon as I say, \"Nigga,\" then everyone react\nAnd wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black\nWell pound that, then\nTalkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then\nLike you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then\nLike you was on the plantation gettin' down back then\nAight, look\nI see a black man aimin' his gun\nBut I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son\nAnd I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean\nYou still trapped in a rut\nAnd I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?\nSo you can keep livin' on free government assistance?\nFood stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em\nFor some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?\nWhile you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?\nYou already late\nYou motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait\nIt's like you're proud to be fake\nBut you lazy as fuck\nAnd you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight\nAnd then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face\nYou can't escape problems\nYou can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar\nGot nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald\n\"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom\"\nMy voice been back\nI'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black\nI'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black\nMy head's in the cloud\nHeard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house\nMaybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out\nOr maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now\nI'm not racist, and I never lie\nBut I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine\nI worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs\nBut you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God\nAnd all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you\nMusic rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you\nThen you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues\nBlame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks\nBlame it on everybody except for your own race\nBlame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids\nAnd just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president\nBunch of class clowns\nNiggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down\nHow dare you try to make demands for this money?\nYou gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger\nI'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war\nI heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?\nY'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more\nIt's like you wanna be so famous\nYou'll do anything for attention and a little payment\nI can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers\nPants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?\nPull your fuckin' pants up, nigga\nPut that suit back on, take that durag off\nTake that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff\nAnd then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?\nI'm not racist\nIt's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors\nI'm not racist\nBut there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours\nI wish that I knew yours\nI'm not racist, I swear\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith all disrespect\nI don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at\nScreaming, \"All Lives Matter,\" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?\nAnd that's one war you'll never win\nThe power in the word, \"Nigga,\" is a different sin\nWe shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is\nBut that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends\nNigga\nThat word was originated for you to keep us under\nAnd when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other\nAnd when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under\nAnd even if I wasn't picking cotton physically\nThat don't mean I'm not affected by the history\nMy grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me\nAnd you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga\nI'm sorry, you can never feel my life\nTryna have faith, but I never felt alright\nIt's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites\nJudging me by my skin color and my blackness\nTryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet\nNow I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet\nYou crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics\nDon't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes\nWhen I ain't making no dough\nYou think you know everything, but you don't\nYou wanna copy our slang and everything that we know\nTry to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah\nFuck, I'm exhausted\nI can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit\nI'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit\nAll you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with\nAnd you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you\nYou don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue\nYou don't know about the two-step or no loose change\nYou don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know\nAnd even though Barack was half as black\nYou hated President Obama, I know that's a fact\nYou couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back\nAnd then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that\nI'm not racist, I never lied\nBut I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines\nYeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god\nHe was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga\nAnd all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you\nHatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you\nAnd then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue\nBlame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ\nBlame it on everybody except for your own race\nBlame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens\nAim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but\nI might be any day now\nTreatin' everybody how you want and any way how\nI swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now\nAnd now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit\nYou know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it\nWhen Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest\n'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us\nI'm not racist, but I cry a lot\nYou don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot\nYou don't know what it's like to mind your business\nAnd get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not\nYou worry 'bout your life, so you take mine\nI love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time\nI wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives\nSo we could understand each other more, but that'd take time\nI'm not racist\nIt's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides\nI'm not racist\nBut there's two sides to every story and now you know mine\n\n[Outro]\nCan't erase the scars with a bandage\nI'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'\nAgree to disagree, we could have an understandin'\nI'm not racist"

Kelly\nR.I.P. Lil Snupe, give that boy his life back\nTake Eric Holder, give us Eric Wright back\nI'm sending you this message, Lord, I hope you hit me right back\nThey say I'm on the wrong train, I know I'm on the right track (Yeah)\n'Cause Trayvon gone, and all he did was try to fight back\nZimmerman walk around free, we don't like that (We don't like that)\nWhy you take our mothers from us?\nOur fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us?\nGot these children getting murdered while they double dutchin'\nWonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us?\nDamn, you took a true king, a true brother from us\nThis a fuckin' marathon, but they runnin' from us\nNow everybody got guns, niggas up to something\nAnd every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something\nYou know it's not fair, tell the truth, I've been in my feelings too\nBut if you took Emmett Till, at least take Dylann Roof\nAt least take James Holmes, I ain't even mad at that\nJust bring back Whitney, and give us Michael Jackson back\nFeds want me in the slammer, damn\nAin't no justice for Sandra Bland, we up like the ceiling fan\nLord, if you listenin', I'm just lookin' for a hand to hand\nTake out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again\nDrownin' in my tears, tryna pray for something (Woo!)\nWonder why you give us life for you to take it from us (Woo!)\nWonder why you give us family then erase them from us (Woo!)\nMaybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us (Yeah)\nMaybe I'm just probably tripping 'cause I need a hug (I need a hug)\nThe hood can't find jobs, now we need a plug (We need a plug)\nEverybody and their mama tryna be a thug\nI don't go to church 'cause I'm afraid of being judged\nI've been starin' at the ceiling as I lie in bed\nWatchin' niggas follow trends like Simon Says (Yeah)\nI pray you give us back the real ones and try again\nOr maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead\nTomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive\nLaura Ingraham laughin' at death and disrespectin'\nI really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson\nEither that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings\nI left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention\nCost too much to pay attention, then it got expensive\nFather forgive me, for I know not what I do\nAnd now I'm reachin' out to you, hopin' you hear me and return the message (Joyner)\nI know that you got our back and that you're not against us\nOr maybe you just love us so you doin' shit to test us\nI just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us\nThey say that the good die young and I ain't on the guest list\nI've been drinkin', Lord forgive me, it's my blood racin'\nI don't know what I'm thinking, I'm just frustrated\nI don't mean to question you, I'm just confused\nI don't know what else to do, I've been patient and it sucks waiting\nTook my mans from me, that forever hurts\nBut puttin' the blame on you, that'd never work\nI know this ain't your fault, it's the devil's work\nDevil's work"

Wait\nWhat if I told you that I was gay?\n\n[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh\n\n[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]\nYeah\nWhat if I told you I'm not alright?\nI mean, I don't feel dead, but I'm not alive\nAnd what if I told you, \"I'm not like you\"\nAnd the shit I've been goin' through, it'll prolly make you cry\nAnd what if I told you, \"I'm not this\"\nAnd the person you think you know don't exist\nLook, I'm not who you know, I'm not who you wish\nI'm not who you want me to be, what you want from me isn't this\nI grew up in church where I couldn't be myself\nI felt like a prisoner, couldn't leave my cell\nThey told me, \"God don't like ugly,\" and this an ugly world\nAnd if I ever seen things different, then I would burn in hell\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]\nAnd on the real, this is not new, this is not a phase\nI grew up different than I was raised\nBut still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait\nWhat if I told you that I was gay?\n\n[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nWhat if I told you I'm homophobic?\nAnd you have zero control over your impulses\nAnd the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit\nIt's something I can't sugarcoat, it's repulsive\nWe were homies, since children, I thought it\nBut thought I was buggin', though\n'Cause we'd sit, chill and just talk chicks\nNow how can we be friends still after all this\nUnless, I can convince you to repent\nAsk God to forgive you for your sins\nAnd begin healin' your conscience\nAnd rid you of this sick illness that causes it\nPart of me wishes you'd kept this shit, still in the closet\nI'm white but I'm gettin' mixed feelings like Logic\nYeah, I'm pissed off a little, this is a choice\nWe were supposed to be boys\nYou're actin' like this ain't optional\nWhat if I said you was weak?\n'Cause you don't got the strength to conquer some biological monster that's part of you\nThat's responsible for them homosexual thoughts\nIf you don't want a lecture, part\nLike a sofa section or long as you\nMake your decision and stand by it, but I can't be beside it\n'Cause for me, that'd be next to impossible\nOr you learn to control your urges\nYou say, \"It's like pullin' teeth and morals are oral surgeons\"\nBut how would you even know anyways if you're a virgin\nWhy can't you be a normal person?\nWhat if I tried steerin' you towards a girlfriend?\nWouldn't work, would it? You seem pretty surefooted\nI'm sure good at judgin', but I have no right\nI know goodbye seems cold, right?\nNot even a flicker of hope like a strobe light\nAs I leave and I swear I stayed up that whole night\nAnd no, I didn't know you would go right home and go take your own life\nI ain't mean for that shit to happen, I said I won't cry\nI let the best friend that I've ever known die\nAlone, was gonna tell you the next day\nI'm so sorry, I'm fightin' my own demons, I won't lie\nThey won't leave me alone, eating at my soul, this whole time\nI've been tortured, imprisoned in my own mind\nA born again Christian but Lord if you're listenin'\nWe might be headed for a collision\n'Cause when I told my boy I couldn't support his decision\nI was tryna make it seem like a choice, when it isn't\nCan't be cured with a prayer to Saint Jude\nWhat If I told you my wish never came true?\nWhat if I'm a hypocrite who's afraid to just face truth? Wait\nWhat if I told you I'm gay too?\n\n[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh\nDuh nuh"

What you crying for?\nLooking at me like you love me\nWhat you lying for?\nWhy you want to try me for?\nBlow your fucking candles out\nEnjoy that cake I got you, for your stupid little birthday that everyone's so excited for\nExcept me\nShit I dare you to disrespect me when you grow up\nThat's gonna be the last time you ever swell up\nFuck you thought\nEverything was perfect, now its fucking lost\nAnd its all your fault\nHappy Birthday Nigga\n\n[Chorus]\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes I wanna kill myself so I don't have to deal wit' you\nI know it sounds harsh but I'm just being real wit' you\nAnd I ain't looking forward to none of that father shit\nI ain't got time for that type of shit\nAnd your mom ain't gonna like this\nBut we ain't\nShooting no hoops\nFlying kites\nWe ain't riding bikes\nI hope you get your ass beat\nI ain't teaching you how to fight\nI ain't here to kiss you goodnight\nI don't care to give you advice about girls\nI hope you get your heart broken for dear life\nI fucking hate you!...\nAnd I know that its wrong\nSometimes I wanna explain but I don't know where to start\nCause you won't understand even if I told you my thoughts\nCause even when its light\nI feel like i'm alone and its dark\nMy mind keeps racing fast\nI can't bear with this pain I have\nI can't stand you\nAnd I hate the fact that you just a mistake\nAnd that's just what the fuck you was\nEverything was perfect\nNow its fucking lost\nAnd its all your fault\nHappy Birthday Nigga\n\n[Chorus]\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n\n[Verse 3]\nShit I wanted to be a father so bad, I would give it all\nJust to have my baby sit in my arms while I'm holding on\nAnd to feel that beautiful feeling of love for my first born\nEven play you the first song, that you hear when you first come\nI loved your fucking mother so much I would give my heart\nTo be down to death do us part\nTill I drown in a fucking pond, till I burn in a blazing building\nApartment fire with bombs\nTill I crash a Mercedes car, by a drunk drive on broad\nWith seven heaters on me\nAnd then she fucking cheated on me\nDrinking with her friends and they didn't wanna leave the party\nGot drunk and had sex, I ain't even see it coming\nAnd then we find out she was pregnant, and she keeping secrets from me\nThis don't make sense and I felt my fucking heart cave in\nThe baby not mine, the paternity test came in\nAnd the love is gone\nEverything was perfect, now its fucking lost\nAnd its all your fault\nHappy Birthday Motherfucker\n\n[Chorus]\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n(Happy Birthday to you)\n(Happy Birthday to you)"

So why should I expect a gift on Valentine's Day? And I'm here    chewing on some fucking bubblegum waiting on some hard dick that's probably in the next bitch right now. So you know what? I'ma go find me my own chocolate"

(Huh)\nWhen are you gon' level up?\nWhen are you gon' grow another foot? (Huh)\nWhen are you gon' show us that you number one? (When)\nAnd everything that you accomplished in some years about to take me just a couple months\nDon't you think I'm bluffing neither\nI thought you were tougher, eager (Damn)\nHow you almost signed to Justin Bieber?\nYou look like a fuckin' beaver (Haha)\nTen years in the game but yo' ass still sittin' on the fucking bleachers\nBoy, you just another diva (Just another diva)\nHeard yo' grandmama kicked you out the house screaming\n\"Tory, we don't fucking need you\"\nWhy yo' daddy up and leave you? (Why)\nI guess this is how they fucking treat you\nAnd you my puppet, you my Cousin Skeeter\nThis ain't what you wanted, they been waiting for it\nI'm Joyner Lucas, what the fuck you niggas take me for\n(What the fuck)\nI pull up in a Demon but I kill Satan for it\nIf you want attention Tory you gon' have to pay me for it\nAll these hoes love me but you sucker niggas hate me for it\nYou roll up on me, catch a shot at ya Mercedes door\nThe bullets fly, you recline like a La-Z-Boy\nAll you do is cry, you a child, you my baby boy\nYou call yourself Tory after The Notorious Big (Yeah)\nBiggie turning in his grave when he hear yo' shit\nDon't ever think that you could ever come compare yo' shit\nLittle girls and kids only ones who feel yo' shit\nI skipped the plaques on my way to a Grammy\nAll your records soft and sweet, niggas think that you candy\nYour niggas really convinced you that you think you can scare me\nAnd you got identity issues, niggas think you a tranny, really? (Damn)\nTory tell us why you always gotta lie in your rhymes (Why)\nI know keeping up with lies can get tiring sometimes\nYou not a G and deep down you wanna hide sometimes\nStaring at the sunshine and start crying sometimes\nYour real name is Daystar, you been dying to shine\nAnd when you sing you kinda sound like you dying sometimes\nYou make the type of tracks that had me feelin' silent inside\nNobody take you serious, put all the violence aside\nOkay, let's talk about your plagiarism that you hate to mention (Yeah)\nOr talk about the hate you giving to the greats you dissing\n(Let's talk about it)\nAnd that writer who wrote yo' shit still ain't get paid on that \"Don't Die\" record\nYou should probably go pay the nigga (Yeah, man)\nAnd how the fuck you talk about Kendrick when he a legend (Huh)\nThen go bite the nigga style on your record right at the ending\nOn \"4AM Flex\" 2 minutes and 50 seconds\nSound exactly like \"The Art of Peer Pressure\", go take a listen\nYou inspired by the niggas you name dropped\nCatch fire in the rain, no umbrella to shelter you and no rain drops\nWhen I seen you on Flex, I gave props\nBut then we found out you stole Don Q shit from the train stop\nYou thought you were fly 'til the plane drop\nUgly motherfucker tryna stunt in a tank top\nIt's no wonder why they used to feed yo' ass with a slingshot\nYou my son, this the last time I'll give you a Ring Pop\nSit down, you on punishment\nAnd don't get up until you see me\nAnd don't even think about touching that TV\nNo more video games, no more phone, no more 3D\nNo more radio or boombox for your weak ass CD\nMatter of fact, give me your chains back and everything I bought you\nYou a disgrace to this family and everything I taught you\nI hate to say it son but you make me sick\nI should'a knew you weren't shit when you came out with a baby dick\nIt's no wonder why you pay for pussy\nTory you think you slick\nAll you do is lounge around the house all day like a lazy prick\nShit, highly disappointed in you son, I need some answers\nHow come you couldn't follow in my steps and be a dancer?\nOr maybe write a book like me or be somebody's grandpa\nInstead you wanna be a fucking rapper with some hair plugs\nNo more rapping, give me your pen and paper\nNo more lying to the people on how you the biggest gangster\nNow hurry up and get your juicy out the refrigerator\nYou going to bed at eight o'clock and not a minute later\nNo, I don't wanna hear it\nNo, let this be a lesson\nClose your mouth and go into your room like I suggested\nI'm a get real Joe Jackson in a second\nMatter of fact, give me your toys, I'm adding that to the collection\nI just did a show and got it lit ya little nigga\nAnd my freestyles killing your originals nigga\nCouldn't name a bitch I couldn't get ya little nigga\nYou a rebound, even Scottie Pippen know nigga\nYou ain't from Toronto, put that on the Bible\nI put six hollows in your Ferragamo\nNigga, you from Brampton, go spin the bottle\nBitch I'm from New England, me and Brady in the El Dorado\nNow come get on my level, I'm hard as metal\nI bomb the ghetto, I brought the shovel\nI bury all of you little ninja turtles\nYou Donatello, you soft as jello\nYou must be gone off that Amaretto\nIt's hard to tell 'cause you soft as pillows\nYou fucking midget, I call you Willow\nI throw you out a fucking car window\nI step all over your Margielas, you caught feelings\nYo' heart spinning, my bars illing\nI'm Bob Dylan, I'm John Lennon, I'm authentic\nYour bars running no off limits\nDon't talk business, don't talk, listen\nI'm off this so you fuck this you fuck! Nigga\n\n[Outro]\nWhat, nigga\nFuck out my face nigga\nAyy nigga look\nWe gonna get one in, pause\nLet's not, let's not do this back and forth shit no more\nI, I think we know what's up, you know\nHa ha ha, Joyner"

I dapped him up and got to sliding\nHe crinkled it up, walked off then put it in his pocket\nOff to the strip club with some drinks and some orders\nHe pull that hundred out his pocket, uncrinkled the corners\nStageside, watching this one bitch shaking and twirling\nBusted it open all exotic and maybe she's foreign\nShe making eye contact, she got on eye contacts\nShe sees that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that\nShe's thinking \"I want that\", he takes a sip from his glass\nShe bend over, he slaps her ass and puts some ones in her crack\nHe whispered in her ear \"How long are you here? Tell me you single\nOh, you got a man? Fuck, I don't care, tell him I'm queer\nSave my name as Susan in your contacts, hm\nAnd fuck your relationship, I ain't worried about that, heheh\nCan I use that red marker, sir?\nLet me write my number on this hundred for you\nMake sure you hit me up when your boyfriend can't do nothing for you\n(508)-507-2209\"\nShe got home and opened her purse as soon as she gets to the door\nCounting them dollars, smoking tree while she sit on the floor\nI don't think she like how this shit make her feel\nBut you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills\nFor real, she wanna get high now, uhh\nGrab the Benjamin off the floor, she feeling alive now, uhh\nFew grams of coke on the table, that's the right now, uhh\nShe rolled a hundred up and stuck it up her nose like\nThat's what she call Heaven's door\nThat's what she call Snow White, the white without seven dwarfs\nShe throw a hundred back at her purse and headed down to the store\nShe needed blunts for the gas, she needed gas for the Ford\nShe needed eggs and some dill, she needed cheese and some milk\nShe needed change\n\n[Interlude]\n\"What what number is that?\nI said what number is that on the bill, what is that?\nYes, in red, it's like a phone number\nWhat is this? Never mind\"\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"Aye aye, don't you make one mothafucking move\nEmpty that register, I know you don't need my help\nHurry the fuck up, look, don't make me repeat myself\nGimme the cash, follow instructions, don't be fucking moving\nCause I'd hate to kill you over something stupid\nNow hand me the bread and place your hands on top of your head\nTake my tough advice\nTurn around and count to a hundred if you love your life\"\n\n[Refrain]\nNow keep it a 100\nUhh, keep it a 100\nYeah, keep it a 100\nOne hundred\nKeep it a 100\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit\nMoney's the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit\nHe put that hundred inside of collection plate on Sunday too\nHope that it'll take away your sins, maybe someday soon\nBut anyway, they covered the plate and just continued praying\nAfter church, the pastor opened it up and started saying\n\"Lord forgive me but I need this, I've been really static\"\nAnd he grabbed the hundred off the top and started staring at it\nHeld it up to see if it's real or fake\nThen looked around to make sure nobody was looking, and then he took it, damn\nOff to the streets with the Lord, off to go find him a whore\nA hundred bucks in the dash and now he riding the course\nHe see some bitch on the corner, he told her hop in the car\nAnd then she opened the door\n\"Come on bitch, yo hurry the fuck up, I ain't tryna get caught up\"\nThen continued driving and stuff, looking for a spot in the cut\n\"How much for head?\"\n(A 100)\n\"Now how much for sex?\"\n(A 100)\n\"Damn, a 100?\"\n(Come on, that's not a lot)\n\"Fuck\"\n(Why you playing?)\n\"Nah, I'm just saying, that's a lot bitch, like gotta calm down, damn\"\nNow she making eye contact, she got on eye contacts\nShe see that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that\nShe's thinking \"I want that\", he pulls his dick out his pants\n\"Ooh God is good\"\nTransaction complete, and she went back to the streets\nBack to the cash at the leash, she back to get back on her knees\nAnd she don't like how this shit make her feel\nBut you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills\nFor real, she wanna retire soon, she swear to God (*smack*)\nShe looked up and seen the hand of God, oh my God...\nForgot she had a pimp\nThat nigga been looking for her ass for days\nTook every single dollar and left her eye black and gray\nHe be on the corner jamming, getting drunk that-a-way\n7-Eleven gambling, throwing all his cash away, yup\nSome say that money rule the world, I know you heard that shit\nMoney the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit\nYeah, that pimp just lost that hundred dollars in that dice game\nHe said \"I should've just bet that shit on tonight's game, whatever nigga, nice game\"\nThe homie who won it walked off with the hundred\nThen opened up his wallet, stuck it inside and then put it in his pocket\nStarted stomping and running\nFeeling so good, started hopping and jumping, money flopping and rumbling\nHis eyes is as big as his smile, no stopping him from the prow\nHe's jogging, skipping around, 'til his wallet fell on the ground\nA hundred sticking halfway out, in the back of a halfway house\nFor like three weeks so don't even ask me how, check it\nA homeless man walks by, sees a wallet, opens his eyes\nAnd then grabs it, opens to check what's inside and to his surprise\nIt's money, a couple dollars, a hundred bill with some writing\nA number written in red, if he had a phone he would call\nBut he doesn't, so he says \"Fuck it, it's mine\nAnd I'm really hungry and thirsty, I want some beer, a beef jerky\nMaybe some ten percent juice, hm\nAnd if the store's open, I need some cigarettes too\", true\nHe walked into the same store on the block\nJust so happen to be the same exact store that got robbed\nWhat a coincidence, that shit is just as weird as I thought\nThe clerk rang him out and said, \"That'll be 18.25\"\nAnd then he held that hundred out with the red number written on top\nThen everything stopped\n\n[Voicemail]\nYo wassup, this is Joyner\nI'm unable to take your call right now\nLeave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace\n\n[Brief Message]\nMr. Lucas, Officer Michael Bradley with the police department\nTrying to get a hold of you now, this is the third time calling\nI need to speak to you with regards to some serious charges\nYou need to get back to me as soon as possible\nOr we'll be showing up at your door\nWith about 10 officers and some handcuffs\nChoice is yours"

Whoo! Hol' on\nGoddamn it, nigga\nFuck you mean? Whoo!\nAnd I don't trust a mothafucking soul\nWhat the fuck you mean? Whoo!\nHol' up, whoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhat the fuck you mean? Whoo!

No one follow codes\nWe both know that jail ain't the place you wanna go\nSomebody fuckin' on your bitch, you tryna call her phone\nIf I was you, I'd tell them boys everythin' they wanna know\nPssh, okay, let's think about this, let's embrace it\nLet's make an illustration\nLet's say you switch up with it and bitch up and then make a statement\nNow niggas in jail, that nigga ain't tellin', had no snitch temptations\nNow you might be free, but you might get killed for givin' up information\nAnd if you don't get killed, then that's a wrap, everybody gon' know you as a rat\nWon't get no respect for the rest of your life, nobody wanna know you after that\nYou might just run, but you never could hide, how long you hopin' that'll last\n'Fore they catch you slippin' and give you somethin' that you know you had to have?\nFuck that, let's say you keep your mouth shut and take the blame for it\nNow you need money on your books, ain't no one payin' for it\nNo visitations or no letters you've been waitin' for\nThat pussy you've been cravin' for, you may not get laid no more\nAnd all them niggas that you call your brothers'll be ghost\nThe only one who got you is your mother if you close\nA bunch of niggas screamin' \"free you\" and makin' posts\nNo one show up to your trial, niggas pray that you get smoked\nMan, please tell me you ain't 'bout to take this sucka's advice\nYour kids'll grow up knowin' that you just a sucka for life\nLackin' morals and integrity, it come with a price\nAnd if you fold, then you should know that we ain't nothin' alike\nAnd if you leavin' here tonight, you better cop a burner\nDon't fuck around and be somebody ain't nobody heard of\nNow here's your choice, be a man or be somebody murdered\nIt's either you can take the stand or you'll be Bobby Shmurda\nFree Bobby Shmurda (Shmurda, Shmurda, Shmurda, Shmurda)\n\n[Outro]\nAlright\nSo it was me, C-Dot, Killa, Rico and Vic\nCut the shit\nWho is Rico? Who is Vic? (Snitch)\nI want their real names (Snitch)\nKilla's name is Jonathan Taylor (Snitch)\nAnd Rico's Michael McCormick\nAnd Vic (Snitch), he was the person, pretty much\nHe was like the head of the operation\nSnitch (Snitch, snitch)\nSnitch (Snitch, snitch)\nSnitch (Snitch, snitch)\nSnitch (Snitch, snitch)\nWhat's up now, nigga?\n*Gunshot*"

On some G shit, man?\nBro, what kinda shit is that, man?\nReally, my nigga? Yo, you a little bum ass nigga, man\nWhen I see you, I need a fair one, G, facts"

I be, I be\nOn stages, and ain't there nowhere I got to go\nI ain't got no fucking patience that's one thing you got to know\nAll these rappers in my way, they think they famous, I don't know\nWhen I watch them hit the pavement I'ma feel like Holly Holms\nI swear it don't get no better than this\nI told my bitch we better get rich\nThen flip these chips and get a new whip\nAnd twist my wrist in front of ya, none of ya\nWant to get pimped you son of a prick, let's flip this win and then uh\nJump in the air\nI just want to dig a hole in a cell\nI just want to say Hello to Adele\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah yeah whooh whooh\nI just want to let you know that I'm here\nI just want to sing a song and a prayer\nI just want to make a toast to El Chapo\nMy idol, I might dig a hole in a cell\nI should probably change my hoe to affair\nI could probably make your hoe disappear\nDifferent emotions you don't know what to feel\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlways feel like my jeans burning\nNo bail and I'm seen murdering\nNew gold grills and your teeth hurt\nI'm still walking and my feet hurt\nWhere's Uber when you need one?\nJust tell me where you see one\nI'm driving bars on the wall\nOkay, where's Luda when you need her?\nListen, I'm my back to the wall\nThen I'm back to the zone, I'm in a Twilight\nIf you ever get a minute tell them other little niggas I've been winning I've been doing it from hindsight\nDon't you ever get a pen in on my level never said I'm not a rebel don't you ever get on my mic\nAnd you ever been a kid and been a winner by the niggas and the pen I'ma end 'em in the limelight rhyme-light\nI'm like, I'm like\nSwish swish whooh\nI'm like eh ya hoe, there I go\nI'ma kill the game this year\nSay I won't, may I? Woo\nI don't give a fuck about no haters or what I never did\nI got angels here and that's evident\nI got halos all in my head I swear\n\n[Hook]\nY'all done lost your motherfucking mind, ooh\nY'all done...

(Resolution)\nI'm talkin' evolution (Evolution)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI gotta be honest, I never thought that I would pop this quickly\nFeels good to look at my phone and see Rihanna hit me\nNah, it ain't on no shit like that, shorty a goddess to me\nJust one of my friends that I can vent to when my conscious get me\nLook, I ain't into what niggas is doin', I'm on some other shit\nI never been the type to turn up and be on that clubbin' shit\nI'm lookin' at niggas like, \"Bruh, you grown, how you still love this shit?\"\nI'd rather be home and watch some movies with my son and shit\n'Cause I ain't tryna impress nobody, that shit get old quick\nLike starin' at an old flick\nTrynna travel back in '06\nMaybe hope for what I won't get\nAll that temporary happiness only last until you grow sick\nAnd them lights start to go dim\nAnd the walls start to close in\nAnd the times starts to pass you by\nDon't act surprised\nBetter be careful what you ask from God\nI had some jobs, shit, I quit and took control, my nigga\nGot tired of buildin' companies up that I ain't own, my nigga\nIt's time to grow my nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nEvolution (Na, na, na, na, na)\nI don't know where I'm goin', but I'm learnin' as I'm growin'\nThat's the evolution (Na, na, na, na, na)\nHope I don't finish last, I'm still healin' from my past\nI need some retribution (Na, na, na, na, na)\nDid a lot of gettin' even, but I'm sick and tired of beefin'\nWhat's the resolution?

Cole\nYou said I would never be what? I wouldn't amount to what?\nNow you in this Trader Joe's, same lines, sayin', \u201cWassup?\u201d (Oh)\nTalkin' \u2018bout like how you like my songs, not knowin' it was me\nSecurity had me in a headlock and I told you I couldn't breathe\nNow it's Black Lives Matter and white letters on your shirt\nNow how many black lives did you help, or did you hurt?\nDid you handicap, block, push to excel or did you hinder?\nSince hindsight's 20/20, I guess you don't remember\nNow you with your mixed child, havin' all these mixed feelings\nBut do your black husband know you tried to burn down our village?\nBut never mind, from the line, that's for y'all to figure out\nJust know that boy who wasn't shit bailed all his niggas out\nAnd it's my black queen, I kiss her on her black lips\nAnd she rock Off-White \u2018cause she support black shit\nAnd I'm blacker than a Steeler helmet or a Spike Lee flick\nBlack like the pick stuck in the afro of Kaepernick"

   "lyrics": "[Chorus: Elijah James]\nIn sweet dreams, I kid myself\nHave your love for good\nI really had hoped you'd stay\nBut like the river, you just come and go\nAnd these things, they comfort me\nWhen my mind's on you\nAnd I feel you comfort me\nBut like the river, it just comes and goes\n\n[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]\nI used to think that you was Superman when I was younger (Yeah)\nFindin' comfort in your voice when I was down and under\nPut you on a pedestal and now I kinda wonder if that made sense\n\u2018Cause I'm convinced you showed a lot of colors (Yeah)\nAll them nights I was alone, I hid inside th\u0435 covers\nUsed to argue with my moms wh\u0435never I was stubborn (Facts)\nI never warmed up to the idea of a step-dad because he wasn't you\nAnd you and him ain't even like each other (Word)\nUsed to bring me \u2018round your girlfriends as I recall\nI thought one or two was cool, but I ain't like \u2018em all\n\u2018Cause all you ever did was argue \u2018bout who's right or wrong\nAnd you ain't have no job, so you would sit at home and light a bong (Yeah)\nUsed to crave for your attention, but I never got it\nAnd everything you said we'd do is just another promise\nYou had dreams of bein' famous and I never doubted\nBut I started rhymin' to impress you, if we bein' honest (Facts)\nBut we can have some bondin' time and maybe pow-wow\nA father/son relationship that we can smile \u2018bout\nAt time's you got abusive and I had to bow down\nOr keep on makin' music to try and compete with Bow Wow\nYour father died when you was young, I think that made a scar\nI started thinkin' maybe that's why you the way you are (Nah)\nEnd of the day, no excuse for how you played your part\nTold myself when I became a father, I'ma raise the bar (Word)\nWe had a lot of fallin' outs and didn't talk for years\nAnd all them birthdays and holidays got awfully weird\nYou threw me in a foster home and I was brought to tears\nLivin' with some strangers, feelin' anxious, I was lost and scared (Yeah)\n\n[Refrain: Joyner Lucas]\nAnd now I'm starin' at the river tryna get across\nAnd all I see is apparitions of what never was\nAnd everything I used to wish for is dead and lost\nAnd if I never see your ass again, I'll be better off\nI'll be better off (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Elijah James & Joyner Lucas]\nYou are so negative (Uh)\nAnd you say you know\nBut you know a goddamn thing\nLike the river, you just run and go\nYou say you could do good\nAnd better you know\nBut you tried no goddamn thing\nLike the river, I'ma run from you\n\n[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]\nI told myself I wouldn't write a song, but fuck it, I did\nOftentimes, I sit and wonder if it's somethin' I did\nOr maybe I was immature, but is it somethin' I said?\nI can't help but feel the feelin' that there's somethin' I missed\nI told you somethin' happened to me and you ain't protect me (Yeah)\nYou tried to say you ain't believe me as you disrespect me (Facts)\nAnd plus, you never had my back, in fact, you may resent me in a way\n\u2018Cause everythin' I say, you try to use against me (Word)\nAnd I never knew your other kids, but I knew of \u2018em (True)\nI'm not really sure if I like \u2018em, but I do love \u2018em (Do)\nShit, I don't even think you knew but just a few of \u2018em\n\u2018Cause all your baby mothers stayed away to keep you from \u2018em (Word)\nYou probably out fillin' they heads with shit that's not the truth\nYou probably told \u2018em that I switched up when I got some loot (Uh)\nYou probably told \u2018em that I'm greedy and I'm not so cool\nThat I worship the devil and I sold my soul to cop a pool (Yeah)\nI worked my ass off to get rich, let's not confuse\nI sacrificed my whole twenties just so I can move (True)\nWhile everybody else was chillin', hangin' out with crews\nI was writin' a plan to finally win while tryin' not to lose (True)\nI still remember signin' my deal and you got hella funny\nAnd at that time, you probably figured I had hella money (Yeah)\nBut I only got a small advance, so I ain't even get a chance to hold you down\n\u2018Cause then you started gettin' jealous of me\nBut I'm worth a couple million now, I turned out fine (Yeah)\nI copped my moms a big crib and went and got mine\nAn indoor pool with a house made and I'm not lyin' (Nope)\nA happy son who loves his dad, it's about time (Yeah)\n\n[Refrain: Joyner Lucas]\nBut I'm still starin' at the river tryna get across\nAnd all I see is apparitions of what never was\nAnd everything I used to wish for is dead and lost\nAnd if I never see your ass again, then I'll be better off\nNigga I'll be better off\n\n[Bridge: Elijah James]\nKarma comes back and it's co-co-comin' (Co-co-comin')\nTreatin' me bad and I'm ru-ru-runnin' (Ru-ru-runnin')\nKarma comes back and it's co-co-comin' (Co-co-comin')\nTreatin' me bad, I'm ru-ru-runnin' (Ru-ru-runnin')\n\n[Outro: Joyner Lucas]\nAnd congratulations, nigga, you won\nAnd all the love you never gave me, I can give to my son\nEternal love to my child, we'll forever be one\nThanks to you, I know the man that I would never become\nNever become"

What's mine is yours\nWhat's yours is mine and I'm down for, we ridin' for it\nWe wanted this a long time ago, what you waitin' for?\nGoddamn, you let me down again (way to go)\n\n[Bridge: Snoh Aalegra]\nI got pain in my soul, way to go\nAnd I ain't prayed in so long, way to go\nThis sinnin' can't save me no more, way to go\nThis the end of the road\nI got pain in my soul, way to go\nAnd I ain't prayed in so long, way to go\nThis sinnin' can't save me no more, way to go\nThis the end of the road\nI got pain in my soul, way to go\nTa-ta ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh why-y-y-y\nI ain't prayed in so long, way to go\nSinnin' can't save me no more, no more\n\n[Voicemail]\nYo wassup, this is Joyner\nI'm unable to take your call right now\nLeave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace\n\n[Brief Message]\nMan, think about a little baby girl and a baby boy\nMan makes them happy, to carry, to carry heavy load\nWhoooooa"

Guess what, motherfucker? I'm the man now\nShe used to hang up on a nigga when I called, that was year 'round\nNow the same bitch wanna give me good brains with her hair down\nAnd that's funny, and my ex wanna call me, saying that she wanna have me\nTalking 'bout \"When we getting married?\"\nBitch you need to find another pappy, and haters don't look too happy\nSwear it's my fault, you done turned me to a monster\nFly ass truck, I'm a Tonka, and I ain't really into the drama\nI'd rather get paid, period, no comma\nMind your damn business, homie what you saying?\nI done came up, fuck is you talking 'bout? I'm just working\nFuck is you thinking? I got some hurt for the niggas\nI got some pork for the bacon, if it ain't bones that I'm breaking\nAnd I was born on probation, they pulled me over to take me\nInside the border, they drained me and cut me open and gave me\nSome fuckin' potion I'm craving, dammit, look what you made me\nI'm just going\n\n[Hook]\nLook what I became from where they found me\nI think you should take a look around me\nI hear people saying things about me\nI think you should take a look around me (x3)\nI hear people saying things about me\nBut I think you should take a look around me\n\n[Bridge]\nMan I wish these hoes could see me now, things changed\nI remember when I used to beg for change, that was way back\nNow I sit and wait while these niggas plotting payback\nSuccess is on the way\n\n[Verse 2]\nUhh, I done came a long way from the stoop where the fiends got their hands out\nRemember lil old me? Guess what, motherfucker? I'm the man now\nHe used to run his mouth 'bout me all around the hood, it was man down\nAnd now the same nigga want a fucking autograph, he a fan now\nAnd that's funny, now my ex girl calling saying that she tryna see us\nTalking 'bout \"Where we gonna meet up?\"\nBitch you need to find another re-up, and haters wanna see me get beat up\nYeah it's my fault, it done turned me to a psycho\nAss so fat she need lipo, and I ain't really into the titles\nRather get insurance on the pussy, no Geico\nMind your own business, homie what you saying?\nI done came up, fuck is you talking 'bout? I'm just working\nFuck is you wishing, I got some dirt for the pigeons\nI got some work for the business so write my words on the ceiling\nI hope I'm hurting your feelings, they pulled me over, I went in\nInside the border to check in, they cut me open and gave me\nSome fuckin' potion or medicine, dammit look what you made me\nI'm just going\n\n[Hook]\nLook what I became from where they found me\nI think you should take a look around me\nI hear people saying things about me\nI think you should take a look around me (x3)\nI hear people saying things about me\nBut I think you should take a look around me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI used to get mad when the hoes ain't flock\nI used to get bullied by the whole damn block\nRunning from the boys, hope I don't get caught\nNiggas had guns, hope I don't get shot\nLord, oh Lord can you answer my prayer?\nBeautiful dreams and these weird nightmares\nStandin in blood with a pair of Nike Airs\nI'm just tryna get a buzz, I'm the real light year\nHo point me to the door, I'm catching my breath\nBlood on my blood, and flesh on my flesh\nMy heart might stop but I'll stretch you out, yes\nMachiavelli and Pac, resurrecting my death\nAnd I'm back as a hologram, Jesus must be inside of him\nWhat you riding in? Wanna talk about ice and Beamers?\nGet your shit broke like Ike and Tina\nI was born on the seventeenth day\nAlong came Joyner, in Heaven we pray\nBorn by the pussy I'll die by the pussy\nThat just means that I could never be gay\nTake a look around me, me, you floss too much\nAnd talk about how you just a boss too much\nI swear I love winning cause I lost too much\nI wanted Drake on the hook but he cost too much\nFuck I look like lying then? I'm a pyro's pirate\nSet the hood on fire, hit the hydrants\nGuess I'm just a product of my environment\nAnd that's word, flashbacks to my teacher in class\nTelling me she hope that I don't finish high school\nAll I know is I came a long way\nAnd I'll be God damned if I ever stop soon\n\n[Hook]\nLook what I became from where they found me\nI think you should take a look around me\nI hear people saying things about me\nI think you should take a look around me (x3)\nI hear people saying things about me\nBut I think you should take a look around me"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]:\nChampagne for my real friends\nReal pain for my sham friends\n(Uh, uh uh uh) Nah\nChampagne for everybody (Yeah)\nUh\n\n[Verse 1]:\nChampagne dreams for them days I was unemployed (uh)\nSelling drugs, trying to live, I was stuck in void (yeah)\nWasn't like I wanted to\nBut what the fuck I'm 'posed to do\nWhen the government ain't giving me no fucking choice?\nThey ain't want to show us love like them other boys\nI was trying to make a change 'til they cut my voice\nI was trying to buy a Range 'til they upped the price on me\nTry to cut the lights on me like they clubbing boy (Boy)\nI can tell ya things, that some people never seen in life\nLiving lavish, thinks that happiness the key to life\nI had a couple bad bitches, I ain't treat 'em right\nI had a couple fat bitches I ain't even like\nBut their conversations was enough to make me sleep at night\nNever fucked 'em, but I made sure they were eating right\nOnly loved 'em 'cause they taught me how to love myself\nGave me something to believe when there was nothing else\nTell me something else\nAll I know is hell, point me to the riches\nIt's funny how niggas screaming, money over bitches\nBut, when them niggas going broke, then it's bitches over money now, oh\nWhoa, that's some fake shit, but that's the world that I know\nShe just want attention, that's the girl that I know (yeah)\nI just want a pension, that's a check that I deserve\nShare it with my niggas, I ain't stressin' 'bout a bird\nAll you ever wanted in life was to be a legend\nAll I ever wanted in life was to be accepted (uh)\nAll I ever wanted at night was a Lamborghini\n'Til I woke from my dreams, and they told me to keep dreamin'\nMy radio demons\nToo much new shit with out a reason (yeah)\nToo much music without a meaning (yeah)\nBut how the hell do I keep believing without achieving\nAnd how the hell do I pledge allegiance without allegiance?\nMe and John Lennon by the fire, singing songs\n\"Kumbaya,\" wishing that my Lord sing along\nReminiscing 'bout every nigga that did me wrong\nPray to God I don't catch 'em slipping, but this is wrong\nThis is wrong\nWe ain't supposed to hold grudges\nForgiven all my enemies for they don't know nothing\nThis is Sunday school church, this is soul touching\nThis that old Keisha Cole back in '07\nThis that Bob Marley dreadlock shit\nThis that grandma in the kitchen cooking ham hog shit, whoa!\nI warned niggas years ago before they cared about me\nLike \"If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me.\"\nBut I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching\nAnd I still got champagne for everybody\nPour it\nChampagne for everybody (yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]:\nShe said\nShe said \"I thought that you were different\"\n\"I thought that you'd be different\" (you'd be different)\n'I thought that you would be submissive' (nah)\nTold you all my secrets while you just pretend to listen\nJust so you can have a feast while you fuck me in the kitchen\nMan, you cold blooded and maybe other hoes love it\nBut I ain't other hoes my nigga I'm so subborn\nThem fucking with my heart is like touching a cold oven\nThat shit barely work, you 'bout to get your feelings hurt\nHold up\nClose my eyes and I never get lost again\nSome niggas cross the line and I never get crossed again\nPigs pulling triggers, these kids won't walk again\nAnd that's the day I promised God that I'd never eat pork again, wait\nNo money, no commas, always had them problems (I wish)\nMore money, more problems, wish I had them problems (I wish)\nI know that finance you stressing had you at the bottom but at least if you was making dollars, you can have some progress\nThey told me only time could tell, but I had no options\nEviction notice, I ain't had no options\nYoung Jeezy bumping, I was on my Tamadotchi\n'Til I almost seen the ghost, I was Action Bronson\nI just wanted champagne while I crack a lobster\nI just wanna see your fucking hands at the concerts\nI just wanna see Meghan Good without the nose job\nI just wanna see Eva Mendes without the clothes on\nAnd so long to my old kins, and my old friends\nAnd so long to my old bitch and her hoe friends\nShout out to all them hypocritical Christians\nWho act like just because I use the words 'niggas' and 'bitches' I can't deliver my message\nCome deliver my blessings\nUpon evil hide your sins , up in witness protection and\nI warned niggas years ago before they cared about me\nLike 'If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me.'\nBut I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching\nAnd I still got champagne for everybody\nPour it\nChapagne for everybody\nThere you go\n\n[Interlude]:\nCan I have everybody's attention, please?\nI need to make a toast\nA toast to every motherfucker that ever did me wrong\nA toast to the basic hoes that played me\nAnd the fuck niggas that slayed me\nA toast to the non-believers and the money-hungry creatures who was sitting down eating steaks and lobsters, crabs and didn't even offer me a fucking biscuit with the butter that they give you at the restaurant when you sit at the table\nI've been hungry since the days I was able to use music as an escape when my aunt was on Section 8 and got her first apartment\nI wanna make a toast to my unborn child, I can't wait to see you smile when you come out\nA toast to all my old friends who backstabbed me and spread dirt on my name\nWell, I got plenty champagne for y'all\nHeh, I got plenty champagne for everybody\nI got champagne for everybody!\n\n[Outro]:\nChampagne, champagne 'fore we all go\nChampagne, champagne 'fore we all go\nChampagne, champagne 'fore we all go\nChampagne, champagne\n(repeat to fade)"

Lamar\nJoe Budden, J. Stylez, P, Nas\nPlenty more, Lauryn Hill, Mos Def\nFarrahman, Kweli, Kanye\nMethod Man, Jay-Z, Beanie Sieg, me\n\n(What about kids?)\nVerse 9:\nInnocent, rowdy plus curious\nRambunctious peer pressure\nFunny ones, smart ones\nEven some who lack guidance, act violent, troublesome\nThey need love, they need us, they need what, they need\n\n(What about drugs?)\nVerse 10:\nEcstasy, coke, 2 acid tablets\nSome reefer, that's THC for my speakers\nI'm PCPing, some bleach and some DVDs\nI buy shrooms and some oxycotins\nSome crystal meth on this beat, got you smoking crack in your seat\n\n(Wordplay)\nVerse 11:\nWordplay, play with words\nEven if the words play\nTetris like a puzzle, puzzle stretching like I'm exercising\nExercising when I'm taxi driving, driving texting while im whiling texting\nTil they pull me over give me breathalyzers\nTempers rising, textin bitches\nLetters like I'm emphasizing, emphasizing by the size of envy put them em inside\nStep aside, keep it in this verse put your friend aside\nThat's what I learned, never mind if ever I should tell a lie\nThen tell a lie, when you see him\nI've been seeing devil's eyes, eyes devil red and God told me that the devil died\nLamborghini diablo, Devil dare me to devil die\nRight off the cliff, satanic strip until the genocide\nOf Free Masons and ask Mason if he choose the Devil side\nIlluminate the Illuminati, not even rep a lie\nMy repertoire get the pot of gold, kill the Leprachaun\nIn Lebanon with my sweater rhymes for the second time"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]\nI've never been a gang banger with street killas\nIf I protect myself, I'll be favoring all these niggas and\nI bought my first gun from my homie who tried to sell it\nA 9 with a couple bullets, just eyes when I'm out here looking\nTrying to find a job to survive so I stop tossing\nHop inside the whip and then drive cause I walk often\nStressing like a bitch, cause I'm tired of my Mom's apartment\nI'm Satan in God's office that's.. (alright hold up.)\n\nShovels to my gravestone, kicking dirt on my coffin\nBroke bitches with their hand out, cause they heard I was balling\nFuck me so good, went to sleep, woke in the morning\nSix niggas in my face, Guns drawn with no warning\nPistol whip, stomped me and left me like I was dead\nI had murder on my conscience, I was plotting on revenge\nCircling the block like I know what I need to do\nBefore I cock the fucking hammer I said what would Jesus do...\n\n[Interlude]\nBecause Christ is not only leader\nHe was teacher\nBut not just leader and teacher\nHe was Christ the redeemer\nChrist the restorer\nChrist the deliverer\n\n[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]\nHate's the only motivation, that's how real we made it\nGuilty by association, you affiliated\nSmoking Newports while I'm riding the Willie Mays\nWatch you niggas turn bitch, there's nothing more humiliating\nI wonder what my life be like, if I ain't had no hobby\nProbably dancing with the Devil, moving like a Jabbawockeez\nI just want change, wonder how much that'll cost me\nI don't think I have a heartbeat I'm just.. (alright fuck it)\n\nTempest keep raging my mind, don't ever sleep\nSee my cousin in the cold, gave him a ride up the street\nBlue flashing lights, pulled behind me it's the police\nSo my cousin reached in his jeans, threw the burner under my seat\nThey pulled us out the car, got charged with a loaded 9\nCause he told the boys it was mine, I was facing a 5-9\nMy Mama sold the car, bailed out in a week or two\nBefore I caught that nigga slipping, I said what would Jesus do...\n\n[Interlude 2]\nNot that Jesus is God\nBecause Jesus never told you to worship Him\nHe told you to follow Him\nAnd you see, Pastor, when we praise Jesus\nHe's worthy to be praised, we feel good don't we\nBut not enough, follow Him\n\n[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]\nRappers on TV with jewels,  we idolize them\nPicturing myself on the news and paparazzi\nBunch of grimy thoughts, niggas never had no conscience\nI've been looking for a jux, being broke is not an option\nI've never been violent, I'm shaking just being honest\nEspecially when my girl ain't working and we was starving\nArgue every minute, fighting in a small apartment\nShe tripping just non-stop and I'm like.. (shh bitch I got to go)\n\nLooking for some pussy to fuck just for one night\nGet some anger out my chest and bust until I'm right\nMet this shorty at the bar, she was working for some tips\nTook me back to her crib and I was nervous as a bitch\nHer husband came home and he was lurking in the crib\nWhile I was jerking in his bitch, he grabbed the burner out the 6\nBursting in the room, cocked it back, from me to you wait\nBefore you pull that trigger think of what would Jesus...\n\n(Gun shots and screams)\nYou're going to feel, the presence, of God\n(Gun shots and screams)"

I'm a nut\nWave strong enough to fucking stop a truck\nSmack you with a hockey puck, rip your fucking pockets off your Hollister\n\nChores [Joyner Lucas]:\nClimbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night\nNinja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night\nSki mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night\nVest on, suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow night\n\nHook [Joyner Lucas]:\nYo, I try and, I try and tell these niggas man\nThey not, they not fucking with me man, I, you know what I mean?\nI've been doing this shit since I was like 9, 10, you know what I mean?\nI can do this in my sleep man\n\nVerse 2 [Joyner Lucas]:\nSon of an artist, I'm fucking bonkers, I roam with bosses\nFucking your daughters, your mothers, aunts, in your uncle\u2019s office\nBorn in a carriage a couple horses while jumping off em'\nThe cops chasing, I fucking lost em' that's fucking awesome\nJoyner the puppet master, I'm stabbing your lung and fracture your back\nTill your nuts will crack in your sack to your fucking bladder\nFunny how now suddenly everyone's a bunch of rappers\nThey just a bunch of band wagon hopping faggot maggots\nGot magic racket, hacky sack it's in my khaki jackets\nA cream colored hat to match it with it after taxes\nThese little hoes know my name they ain't have to ask it\nThe rap assassin, I'm action Jackson the cash attack a freakaziod\nFrankenstein, eat the boy, follow me on Twitter catch me at the BET award\nLooks can be deceiving I'm the daemon in your ouija board\nSneaking through your basement I be creeping and I never make a freaking noise\n\nChores [Joyner Lucas]:\nClimbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night\nNinja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night\nSki mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night\nVest on suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow night"

Fuck, I messed up, I tried my best\nI admire my best cause they say the best things come straight from the chest\nAlmost caught a bullet went straight through my chest\nSo thankful vest and thank to the chick who played me and made me realize I ain't shit\nJust a nigga trynna make it and if I ain't got it, imma take it, if you got it imma chase it\nImma robber in the making, but my head keep ringin'. Heh\nSomebody talkin' about me again probably just another nigga trynna out me again\nProbably just a hater that just won't allow me to win\nGot me sippin' on this bottle of gin, thinkin' bout my role model again\nBut what would my nana think if I was following him?\nStaring at these twin hollows again damn\nWhat a nigga gotta do to make life worth livin'?\nIs worth life livin',  I ain't like most niggas Iont think that\nMe and you cool, I mean we used to back when you was you and I'm still the same\n\nA lot of people change, with a whole lot to lose and a whole lot to gain that's just game, that's just the game\nWe all gonna break, I stay rollin' up, I hate growin' up\nBut wait hold it up, damn look at yo smile, I love it when you smile\nYeah, I love it when you smile, it reminds me of a child\nIt remind me of a child, it remind of the belt and I probably like you cause you remind me of myself\nI'm all grown up, you all grown up\nDon't cry though we been through a lot, so what?\nWe can make it through whatever, that's what I used to tell you, whenever you was down\nBut now it's whatever and everytime I talk to you, shit, it's whatever, whatever\nBut I can't say I wish I never met you, but I wish I never wish I let you get the best of me ever\nWhatever, might as well say goodbye to yourself cause in the end\nAll a nigga really got is himself, true, I used to be down with O.P.P\nUntil other people's personalities told me some otherwise but otherwise don't quote me\nShow me, I never let a nigga control me, that's O.D. what\nAnd Imma tell you like, Barack told me\nHeh heh listen check, I gotta call em' like I see em\nLil cousins only two swearin' next time imma teach him\nKids only three cursin' that's what y'all teach em\nTurn around and beat him kinda hard to believe it\nCut friends off cause Ion't really need em plus Iont really seem em\nAnd iont wanna be em\nI want a relationship, but I don't really need it now\nCause I got two reasons, Iont trust nobody and you ont trust me either and I don't blame you\nCause I don't trust me neither, anything you could do, I could do sweeter\nAnd revenge is sweet, sweet like sugar, Ice tea can't (unavailable)\nI don't want to hear all of that shit, word"

You got it fucked up\"\nHe said \"Keep your mouth shut, pussy, tell it to the judge\"\nI went to court the next day, she was in the stands\nSlipped the cuffs of my hand, then I ran, goddamn\nTook a right down the alley, gettin' chased by the feds\nMade it to my nigga's house and she was layin' in the bed like\n\"You can't run from me Future, don't you understand\nI'm your number one fan, what about our fuckin' plans?\"\nI said \"Bitch, you a crazy schizophrenic heffer leave\nWon't you let me fuckin' breathe?\" She said \"Uh-uh-uh\nIt's you and me\" *gunshot*\n\n[Chorus:  Future Joyner ]\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nLeave me alone\nBitch, leave me alone\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nLeave me alone\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nLeave me alone\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nUh Uh Uh Uh\nLeave me alone"

What kinda niggas you hidin'?\nFaggot niggas, you brag and listen, what kinda dick is you ridin'?\nAin't no competition I'm poppin, fuck your proposition I'm plotting\nAnd ain't no pot to piss in, I'm prolly pissed and inside the kitchen with choppers. (Brrrrr)\n\nCursing like a motherfucka', motherfucka' chillin'\nYeah I can make you mother fuck me and go fuck her feelings\nI play the powerball and I hope I hit a couple million, just so I can fuck them bitches who ain't wanna fuck until then\n\nMy nigga what your rollin'? Fuck that\nNigga that, gimme that hub caps\nThat's more power than MJ dancin' in thriller with a blunt like \"puff that\"\nChillin' in the block with a killa that pop, and it went all like (brrr pap pap)\nSound of the block, like jack the box\nWith a match and a Glock now, run fast\n\nI dunno what you talkin' 'bout\nBeen that nigga that knock them out\nStomp that nigga, now stomp them out\nWalk that nigga, now walk it out\nFlow, like venom in the cold. I'm entering the zone where hoes ain't friends with the hoes. And the men get the most shit, from the police when they beat them cops; pretending\n\nNow hoe that's 508\nWalk on water and drive on lakes\nFly on clouds, I float on bliss\nMy hoe gon' pull it and dot your face\n\nYeah, that's what I like to call\n\n[Chorus]\nSelf-explanatory shit, for warriors\nKilled your car, on the corner\nThe viscous slaughtered the officer\nNo applause, applaud us\nTo rip apart the apartment\nI'll kill your father and start\nWith that nigga's noggin and I'mma just uh\n\n[Verse]\nLeave it at that, I'mma leave it at this\nWhen I'm squeezing that clip, it's enough to stop your breathing that's it\nWhen I'm breathe and I'm sick\nWhen you bleed and rest in piece with that strip\nI'm anemic but eat with the demons telling Jesus \"that's it\"\n\nJoyner's a motherfucka', motherfucka' chillin'\nYeah I can make you mother fuck me and go fuck her feelings\nI play the powerball and I hope I hit a couple million, just so I can fuck them bitches who ain't wanna fuck until then. Uh\n\n(Cause you know they ain't, you know they ain't tryna fuck until you, until you get some money. Yeah.)\n\nJoyner's a motherfucka', motherfucka' villain'\nYeah I can make you mother fuck me and go fuck her feelings\nI play the powerball and I hope I hit a couple million, just so I can fuck them bitches who ain't wanna fuck until then"
