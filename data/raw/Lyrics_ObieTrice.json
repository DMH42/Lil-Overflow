Hi, it's Ike\n'Bout to get my Ike on, I come with a life supply of wife beaters\nAnd my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic\nLookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite\nCome back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke\nBitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right\nHad to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream\nWith the pliers, like \"Ahh!\" only a ruthless bastard would do this\nTake a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris\nGive her toothpicks, stop on the way home, pick up two Big Bufords\nScrupulous, girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!\nSo when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested\nTo impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman\nAnd get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement\nIf you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument\nYou get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nI can tell at first glance you're a ho 'cause your pants are so tight\nWhen you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode\nSo cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco\nBoy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity\nThat's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity\nLook where these random thoughts get me in senseless mind babble\n\"What me? Apologize?\" That's just the way the rhyme unravels\nAnd I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled!\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nJust call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick\nIt's also Richard 'cause I feel like you should\nPry your fucking mouth up off of it\nI said just call me Richard, 'cause I'm a dick\nYou ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick\nWhen I hold my privates it's your first clue, Sherlock, prick!\nJust call me Richard\n\n[Verse 3: Obie Trice]\nThat's my motives, jumpin' off in Rovers\nAll white, like I was right up in the Dakotas\nOr Minnesota, did I mention soda?\nWhen it's mixed with the yola, watch my cup runneth over\nCut from a soldier, them ho niggas disposable toaster\nPutting holes in a nigga getting close enough\nBME 'til the credits roll\n'til my condition is beyond what the medics know\nThey wanna edit O, like a prosthetic third\nLeg let it go, this is Shady 1.0, Em let 'em know\nI still profit through the process\nThe prize in my jeans my balls'll never digress\nI'm a dick that I brag about\nI put it in faster than I drag it out\nWorld, I be your special friend see\n'Cause these suckas suffer from pseudo-penis envy...

Trice get the gats pronouncing\n\n[Hook]\nGet live mothafucka when I speak mothafucka\nOut your seat mothafucka, I'mma reach mothafuckas\nShady Records 'til I sleep, mothafucka\nObie Trice, nothing but street, mothafucka\nTear this bitch up until you bleed, mothafucka\nI wouldn't give a fuck who you be, mothafucka\nPunk, pussy, bitch or G, mothafucka\nAdrenaline rush before you leave, mothafucka\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I speak I blow out your tweeters, a dog\nShow out with speakers, roll out with heaters\nI'm just an animal eating the game\nJump a monkey, fuck yeah, Obie's the name\nI roll solo never been a ho, though\nKeep gats vocal when cats act loco\nWhere you at when I'm moving the crowd\nYou get trampled, mashed on Detroit style\nUp out your seats, pump out the E's\nUp the beats, the crowd \"Obie, please\"\nWhere my niggas at, smoking them trees\nOff the cognac finger fucking a skeez\nThat's how it is when you party with me\nYou don't like it? You L7 like a square be\n\n[Hook]\nGet live mothafucka when I speak mothafucka\nOut your seat mothafucka, I'mma reach mothafuckas\nShady Records 'til I sleep, mothafucka\nObie Trice, nothing but street, mothafucka\nTear this bitch up until you bleed, mothafucka\nI wouldn't give a fuck who you be, mothafucka\nPunk, pussy, bitch or G, mothafucka\nAdrenaline rush before you leave, mothafucka\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd since I came, I've rearranged the place with blaze\nStage dive with Colt Seavers, DNA\nI'm so addicted to getting niggas lifted\nDrunk off the liquid, O. Trice, the misfit\nDousing the crowd with piss and bile\nWe underground, mothafucka fix your frown\nI be the boy with the whiskey toy\nOffa whiskey, you never been to skeet before\nSo, throw up your hands and peep out your man's\nWhen I come through, next quarter Trice at your venues\nAnd trust, I'm attacking it\nI cook up the hot shit like Ainsley Harriott\nThat's why I'm so miraculous and Obie gets you niggas pumped up\nI'll see you next coliseum, chump\nThat's right, it's your Obie Trice fucked up off E's and weed\n\n[Hook]\nGet live mothafucka when I speak mothafucka\nOut your seat mothafucka, I'mma reach mothafuckas\nShady Records 'til I sleep, mothafucka\nObie Trice, nothing but street, mothafucka\nTear this bitch up until you bleed, mothafucka\nI wouldn't give a fuck who you be, mothafucka\nPunk, pussy, bitch or G, mothafucka\nAdrenaline rush before you leave, mothafucka"

Nobody! We's that deal\n\n[Hook]\nYou gon' ride for me (you gon' ride?)\nThen I'm gon' ride for you (I'm gon' ride)\nIf you put your mouth on me (put it on me)\nI'm a put my mouth on you\nTogether there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)\nAny problem we can see it through (we see it through)\nBaby if you promise to be true (you promise?)\nI will never put my hands on you\nCome on and think about it\n\n[Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]\nIf you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me)\nThen I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you)\nIf you promise you'll be true\nThen I'll never put my hands on you (hands down)\nBut! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!\nCause if I put my mouth on you (on you)\nAfter you put your mouth on someone else\nBetter find someone else new\nCome on and think about it\n\n[Outro - Obie Trice]\nYeah..

Ah man, I'mma look fresh when I go to school\n\n[Verse 1]\nSuch a beautiful thing, being embraced by a woman that's a queen\nWith big dreams for the younger sibling\nO couldn't do no wrong\nAccording to report cards Obie brought home\nThey say good in spelling\nSpelling bee's always excelling\nWhich was so overwhelming that Momma took him shopping\nCopped him the new Jay's\nSwear to God homie this was Obie's cool days\nBMX'ing up the block with the tennant living next to him\nShooting hopes, who got hops?\nWorthy, when he pop a jump shot\nNo worries, just a pocket full of sugar or whatnot\nHit the candy house on the block\nIt was pickle in them spot\nThen things turn around when Obie'll lay down\nHear the sounds of fire rounds surrounded em\nAstounded him, the volume of the blast had me so interested\nMomma falling with cash, she can't get a nigga in this bitch\nThey wanna hit the ass, nigga start ditching class\nDad ain't around, he left a nigga\nSagging in them Superman drawers that one Saturday\nIs it my fault, shit got dark?\nMom and I fall apart, relationship taunts, bad talk\n\"Can't stand you, looking like ya Daddy with that same walk\"\n{Muthafucka you - }\nNow a niggas out in the streets\nTwo nickle plated thirty-eights on me\nCan't stay away from beef\nScrapping with them niggas from the other side\nSipping Saint Ives rocking old school flannels\nOld school niggas see that I'm an animal\nFront me at 16, see how my roll handle\nNow I'm up the O's but wait on the affy\nCuz here come my muthafuckin baby, cool\nHad to slow my role\nPlus my P.O. got a nigga pissing in a bowl\nHold my temperment cuz I see such innocence\nWhen I'm looking in Kobie's pupils\nDespite all the dope I sold I had to change my road\nI just might be able to grow old\nOlder brother said, \"Yo O\nI'mma quit my job so we can chase our goals\nI'll be manager-a-go, you can rap I suppose\"\nThat's what we did, I still flipped a little bit\nSaved up my chips and put it into music\n\"Well Known Asshole\" a underground hit\nStill scrambling, looking like shit\nBaby momma think I'm smoking more then a spliff\nThink a blessing came from the man who invented my gift\nWhen Eminem said \"let me hear you spit\"\nWrote my signature, now Shady Obie represents\nHit em with the D12 skit\nCan exhale now I see my Mom's ain't pissed\nShe hit em with a smile cuz Obie became focused\nFrom independent out the trunk like them dope kids\nTo platinum plaques, world tours, getting noticed\nAn inappropriate soldier became so ferocious\nIn this Hip-Hop culture that I long for\nThe roller coaster O was on so young\nTook a turn right into his song\nThat's right, from after school fights\nTo pushing white, to pursuing his career heights\nOne mic's, all I need involved with beats\nI'mma be the streets to Jesus, cars on me\nAnd that'll be the day you applaud and see\nThe underdog gets his eventually\n\n[Outro]\nGotta end it though\nI'm all in it, there's no limits\nAnd it's so splendid\nReal names, no gimmics\nNo image, just a soldier who spoke what he lived\nFrom the ribs with it, the flows vintage\nObie gotta do this for real\nYeah\nObie Trice"

It's Obie Trice man\n\n[1st verse]\nI came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo\nMade him a monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa\nHated the po po, locally known as abominable snow-o\nLater the big 4' rated the home where I made the dough grow\nSo on and so fo', the story of us urban negros\nCreated as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you\nWe as a people heated in evenings doing these evils\nGotta eat to, be cool, got a kid to feed did it reach you\nOr did it seep thru? Or do I just speak thru the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel?\nWhen niggas on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cop when they caught by the cops\nYoung 2Pac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away\nBrick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free, that's why I'm\n\n[Hook]\n[Obie talking over Hook]\nSeen it, I done ate it, I done shit it\nSlept it, lived it, now I spit it\nShady\n\n[2nd verse]\nWorking that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on\nTrying to get rid of the pounds, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on\nSame old song, young nigga thats trying to get some where I come from\nFunds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function\nIn conjunction with selling this substance\nChips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven\nI'mma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me\nBut currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency\nGotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing\nIt's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be\nSuch a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me took to see\nI finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me\n[Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally\nAnd to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me\nTo confirm and unblur my dreams\nBest believe since burst on the scene, I'mma be here certainly\nWith no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'mma get this cheese and that's why he's\n\n[Hook fades out]\n\n[Obie talking over Hook]\nThat's why I'm\nThat's what made me\nHaha\nThat's why I'm\nYoung black man in America\nGet up and get yours nigga\nI know you struggling man, I been there\nI see you\nGet up and get yours nigga\nAin't no looking back now"

I hate to keep twisting 'em\nMy mind ventures, I spit with conviction\nNothing fabricated or based of forcism\nSimply kicking what's living in O Trice's system, come on\n\n[Intro 2]\nI wanna thank Shady records for backing me up for all those years\nNigga, Eminem, Paul Rosenberg, Riggs Morales, (?)\nI wanna thank all my label mates, D12, 50 Cent, G-Unit\nStat Quo, Bobby Creek' and Cashis, it's been one hell of a run\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlbum number truces, found him in a booth nostalging\nWith Dre pounding the beat machine\nO Trice say nothing, deleting them\n'Scope couldn't destroy my evening\nWe are the elite, machine\nNiggas is ass backwards, thinking they in the class, as if\nAnd have access to these type of masses\nWhen I seen this, massive\nFrom a black teen with dreams of being this rapper\nWhat happened is that he slipped between the cracks\nBrought to your ears all the years that I've captured\nRe-appeared after Cheers, the classic\nSecond Round's On Me showed you O mastered it\nCause Obie not an actor in this shit\nActually, it's action show you know different\nI'm ah be a victim on the set that I lived in\n'til I die, it's Obie Tri'\nTry to understand this psychological span\nFrom serving them grams to inserving them fans\nThat's right, Obie hurting them, man"

Why you stretching him out?\nHe got the weapon all because his whereabouts\nBorn and raised, mental slaves\nAnd I don't see change before I'm seeing the grave\nAll I see is my homies corpse decay\nCrying at his wake, can't recognize his face\nFace it, you not identifying with me\nMy identity distorts ya visibility\nSo you can't see me, peep what he's achieving\nYou recieve information from TV\nI'm in the hood, I live it you read about it\nRest in peace Peezy\nPlease believe Obie eyes've seen The Wire\nPrior to what you seeing on the screen\nI done been in and out of the bing\nLost niggas to unfortunate things\nThat's why, praise the Lord I'm still on the scene\nPraise the Creator who made human beings\nJust for creating a nigga like me\nA nigga that put the umph in G, yeah\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Obie Trice] (2X)\n(Wake up)\nI try to reach out but you won't\n(Wake up)\nMy brothers and sisters, we got to\n(Wake up)\n'Fore you stuck in the system, and then you\n(Wake up)\nReality hits you, before you can\n(Wake up)"

(Lay down..)\nI'm a man, man\nI ain't runnin, I'mma stand wit my gun in my hand\nI got plans and a place to BE!\n\n[Verse 2: Obie Trice]\nI ain't tryna be cocky wit it, but I'm the nigga from the block that did it\nGot an honest livin', I ain't tryna see the box in prison\nGetting knocked outta my position\nNow I got a pot to piss in, pissed off motherfuckers' mouth off - bitchin\nProbably cause he lack ambition, so his wack decisions\nGet mad at the nigga that's getting 'em\nThat's when he see the next nigga that's hittin him\nWith a vigorous pistol over this ridiculous issue\nDismiss you, in attempt to\nTake me out my motherfuckin tempo nigga\n\n[Hook 2X]\nLAY DOWN!

No way, no how\nCause she just scarred her face while you were asleep on the couch\nWhen the cops arrive, they lookin at her like \"Ouuuuch!\nLet's take this nigga down\"\nThat's why I jacks my dick off\nI jacks my dick off\n\n[Chorus]\nI jacks my dick off (no I don't want yo' pussy)\nI jacks my dick off, yo (cause yo' shit is kinda funky)\nAiyyo I jacks my dick off (come correct, and maybe we can have a little sex)\nI jacks my dick off (have a little sex)\nWhen I'm alone in my room, yo, I stare at the wall\nCause I got a tall poster of that chick Tina Dickinballs\nAnd it's like she in the same room with me\nCause imagination is a motherfucker tipsy\nGot the Kleenex beside me just in case it get outta hand\nGet it? I'm Del Rio's biggest fan\nJanet Jacme wanted to do just that\n'til she copped a attitude when I was like \"Where the fuck is your glove at?\"\nFuck that! Ain't no chokin my neck, if you not protected\nYou know hands carry infections\nI jacks my dick off\nYo, yo, I jacks my dick off\n\n[Chorus]\nOff off (no I don't want yo' pussy)\nI jacks my dick off (cause yo' shit is kinda funky)\nI jacks my dick off (come correct)\nI jacks my dick off (and maybe we can have a little sex)\nI jacks my dick off (have a little sex)\nI beat my meat on the regular base\nI get tired of havin these stupid rats in my face\nTellin me wait or, \"It's not time, plus I'm on the menustration\"\nAll of this is aggravate\nWhere's Ms. Masturbation? By my side\nI don't worry about her givin me AIDS to make me lose my fuckin mind\nCause STD's inflict strongly in my area\nScrotum, put on some of that old mascara\nAnd jack my dick off\nAiyyo yo yo, I jacks my dick off\nYo!

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI got this chick named Ari, all she do is want to party\nAlways want to meet up in public with a Barbie\nSwear she's a Barbie, Nicki, she got it going\nAss fat, keep a straight wig on her dome\nNever at home, hot ass, she hit the street nights\nPaparazzi, earrings reflecting off the street lights\nNever want to sit tight, she call a nigga midnight\nTo tell me after two, she's coming to get my dick right\nWell baby, that's cool, but listen, I'm getting older\nNowadays, after 2, I'm sleeping, I'm rolling over\nI call you about noon, you was tweaking, you wasn't sober\nI can see you in your room hungover all on the sofa\nThem days over for Obie, I'm on some next shit\nWay it's looking like, I'm going so domestic\nYou ain't cooking nice or hooking up that breakfast\nI'ma direct you to the exit, biatch\n\n[Hook: Obie Trice (w/ Gwenation)]\n(So long, so long)\nI've been fucking y'all for years, time for Obie to duck up out of here\n(So long, so long)\nYou enjoyed Obie's pleasing, but pardon me, good evening\n(So long, so long)\nBeen a player like forever, I'm gone, it's time for O to move on\n(So long, so long)\nYou done had a lot of fun, right? But pardon me, good night\n\n[Bridge: Gwenation (w/ Obie Trice)]\nTime for me to move on\nI'm telling the girls so long\n(I'ma direct you to the exit, biatch)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got this chick named Mona, always want me on the phone with her\nWhen I'm on the road, she blowing up my horn at her\nShe don't like the homies, she always want me alone with her\nSocial skills ill, something had to be wrong with her\nLock me in the crib since she ain't fucking with wanderers\nNiggas got to live, see that will never become of us\nWant to be my rib, literally fuck my kids\nFuck a [?] sister, speak up, yo disappear\nBaby listen here, your tack glisten full of wackness\nYou don't like kids, you need a psychiatric pamphlet\nI don't give a shit how damp your snatch get\nHow loud your ass clap, you's a crazy ass bitch\nGoing through life ass backwards, your motto\nCarrying all that baggage, bottle\nMarrying me's not happening, bye dude\nThere's the door, yep, I mean to be rude\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI got this chick named Keisha, all she do is smoke reefer\nWhen she say she love me, it's hard for me to believe her\nCause when she say she love me, she's rolling up sativas\nSmoker's choiced lips, bitch swears she's a diva\nYeah I grew up off the chronic, but she's so Wiz Khalifa\nKeep a couple grams of OG in her sneaker\nDressed like the 90s, Dooney & Bourke purse\nI try to coerce her to Louie, it never worked\nSo pitiful, forgetful\nYou on some hoopy shit when Obie is so in it, boo\nI like to hit and quit, you claim that it's medicinal\nI swear you be getting more licks than my dick do\nI know you on the, ganja\nSometimes I'm wishing, bitch, that I was marijuana\nYou thinking relationship, I'm thinking more like nada\nI won't be seeing you tomorrow, bitch\n\n[Hook]\n(So long, so long)\nI've been fucking y'all for years, time for Obie to duck up out of here\n(So long, so long)\nYou enjoyed Obie's pleasing, but pardon me, good evening\n(So long, so long)\nBeen a player like forever, I'm gone, it's time for O to move on\n(So long, so long)\nWe're supposed to be peers, but you never caught up, fuck out of here"

I wave back, in fact\nIf you ever peep his wrist, thaw out to bring yourself back\nAttract all bitches in Cadillac on dishes\nWhile I roll a Prism with the fuckin engine light blinkin\nYou know you're stinkin\nWhen the same gauge light on for months to cause another fuckin\nComplication\nLife got me on a menstruation like a bitch\nPlayer hatin all these niggas flossin like they rich\nI got the itch to dip right behind the bush\nIf I catch you slippin, your blood go gush\nFuck that, fuck that, I'm not a thief\nCause armed robbery, murder, cause a whole lot of grief\nI'm tired of grindin my teeth thinkin about the dough\nI'm tired of high class bitches tellin me - fuck N-O, N-O, N-O, N-O\n\n[Hook]"

That's how hard I hit\nCall it collision effect to make you player haters sick\nObie Trice truly is ridiculous with lyrics\nI know you wanna drive my style but talk stiddicks\nNew millenium nigga, bringin mayhem\nMy slave rap is for real, games I never played 'em\nI'll stab him in the abdomen\nAnd leave him gaspin for air like asthma really attacked him\nI'll leave you paralyzed with no more action, or verb\nI know Obie get on your nerves\nI'm like a nigga tryin to stay at your spot, without a job\nOr a gang of thugs beatin on your head by the mob\nRun that sob[?] but no more heartthrob\nYou're stiff like a carcass full of maggots and shit\nLayin on the corner\nI leave bodies more rotted than John Jr.'s body at the motherfuckin coroner\nYour face mutilated, legs decapitated\nFrom foul fuckin your dick, your dick disintegrated\nBurnt niggas never learned nigga\nIt's Obie Trice - now say nice!\n\n[Chorus: Deuce Wonder]\nMy veins pump purple rain\nMy pores sweat liquid cocaine\nMy eyes are dry, dry, dry..\nMy spirit's maaade in proof\nMy body craaaves that juice\nMy mind is high, high, high..\nYou on the wrong side of these drums\n\n[Verse 2: Obie Trice]\nI intensify your high\nBump me through your systems and watch blood trickle out your eye\nI make you feel like you meltin, or seein the devil, in 3-D\nOnly it's Obie on CD\nMr. Trice unfamiliar?\nBut I'm the same nigga that killed ya - go read ya poem\nI hit harder than them Hiroshima type bombs\nRelocate arms - no more wri-ting\nObie Trice be live for the night\nAnd any nigga try to take that, threatens my excitement\nAnd yo, that's when I get violent\nAnd create with your blood like the red violin\nYeah, I bet you'll be silent then\nO. Trice rock harder than infinite horny men\nTipsy off gin, that's when I begin to sin\nEven if I lose no one wins\nI'm an ex-convict escaped from hell\nReturned, to take the world over as well\nMC's rather me be in the cell\nRather than seein me up the block hoppin out a drop-top 12\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Obie Trice]\nI come strapped, with a pack of gats\nThat'll eliminate you, and that flat you stay at\nNosy neighbors\nI break out the arsenic arsenal and firebomb your block for acres\nWho would've thought? Me!\nObie Trice, the destruction of a fake wannabe\nYou claim you're hardcore when you're soft as you wanna be\nThat type of shit gets you lost unfortunately\nYour mother miss ya, she thinks she ain't shit\n\"Oh I ain't raised him right! Oh I'm such a bitch!\"\nShit change, when the bullet meets the brain\nLeave a ugly first impression\nAnd leave a dirty mess on your girlfriend's dress\nAnd he wouldn't give a fuck, how loud the bitch screamin\nCall him a demon, I call him a slug\nNot a thug but a slug that'll rip through a thug's mug\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nBlaow!\nNew millenium shit"
