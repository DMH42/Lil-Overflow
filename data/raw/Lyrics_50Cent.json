  "plain": "Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is an American rapper, entrepreneur, investor, record producer, and actor.\n\nAfter recording a never-released album with Columbia, 50 got on his grind and rose to fame via a string of well-received mixtapes, thus setting the template for rap stardom in the modern era.\n\n50\u2019s crowning success came in 2003 with the release of the album Get Rich or Die Tryin' which sold 872,000 copies in four days and was certified 8x platinum by the RIAA. Since that monster hit, he has continued to make music while also delving into movies, sports drinks, video games, mass charity campaigns, and more.\n\nThe moniker 50 Cent might seem like an unusual, downright humble name for a rapper, but it has nothing to do with the cash in Jackson\u2019s pocket. He adopted the name after his criminal past as a drug dealer and a subsequent conviction. Trying to better himself, he saw \u201c50 Cent\u201d as a metaphor for change."

(Yeah!)\nHe'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the\nMotherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity\nNow take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each\nOne of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see\nThat'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me\nI done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin'\nUp! You\u2019re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me\nFeels like I'ma snap any minute\nYeah, it's happenin' again\nAnd I'm thinkin' about just sayin', \"Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!\"\n\u2018Cause this is all I know\nThis is why so hard I go\nI swear to God I put my heart and soul\nIn this more than anybody knows\nI'm trapped, so all I do is rap\nBut every time I rap I'm more trapped\nAnd I rap myself right to this bubble\nOh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)\nIt's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis\nChrist, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?\nFeels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch)\nAnd I might just blow my lid\nShit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid\n\u2018Cause I'm runnin' in circles with\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try, yeah\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nI haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid\nSold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did\nMaybe this is for me, maybe\nMaybe I'm supposed to go crazy\nMaybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady\nPsycho killer, Michael Myers\nI'm on fire like a lighter\nTry to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick\nWrap your head up in plastic\nPussy, now pick the casket\nDirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic\nIt's sad, it's never gonna end\nNow we number one again\nWith that frown on your face and your heart full of hate\nAccept it, respect it, this a gift God-given\nLike the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"

(Yeah)\nWhen streetlights come on, niggas blast the nines (Uh-huh)\nGet locked up, they read books to pass the time (Woo)\nIn the game there's ups and downs, so I stay on the grind\nNiggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind\nThere ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (Unh-uh)\nThis is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine\nI played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance\nAnd Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents\nI'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers\nRoofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features\nI am what I am; you can like it or love it\nIt feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it, fuck it!\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nIf I can't do it, homie, it can't be done\nNow I'ma let the champagne bottle pop\nI'ma take it to the top\nFor sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)\nIf I can't do it, homie, it can't be done (Haha)\nNow I'ma let the champagne bottle pop\nI'ma take it to the top (Yeah)\nFor sure I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)\n\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nUh-huh\nI'ma make it hot\nDr. Dre\nAftermath\nShady\nHaha"

I lost her\nHer head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her\nAnd put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub\n\n[50 Cent]\nWhen I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up\nThe hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up\nIn Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous\nLook deep in my eye, see many many men die\nI swing gem stars faster than a Samurai\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)"

I'll show you how\nWanna get rich? I'll show you how\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]\nOn ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow\nTeach ya how to turn Yayo into dough\nThe original don dada, nobody bomb harder\nYa heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot\nThe hoodrats they say \"He so crazy\"\nThe snitches they say \"He tried to spray me\"\nBut that's what you get for trying to play me\nThe aftermath and my wrath is so shady\nNo matter how you try, you can't stop this\nI catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coup\u00e9 cockpit\nIf you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?\nFront and find out how my P-40 Glock hit\n\"50, you need some help?\" Chill, Yayo, I got this\nSee, where I'm from, man, the D's tryin' to knock us\nThey swear to God that it's me selling the choppers\nMan, I ain't give them little niggas no product\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI know you like my style\nBut how much do you like my style?\nYou like how I break it down\nWanna get rich?

You're not\nReally, really ready, ready"

Top of the world!\nI'm going crazy\nI'm going out of my head\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI'm exhausted, last night I lost it\nLet the homies get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit\nNana called, my granddaddy coughing up blood\nGot an infection, the cycle of life just sucks\nI bet when he die, she die, just because\nThey been together 60 years, that's what they call love\nPaid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand\nThen two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man\nI woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself\nThought about suicide but me, I ain't killing myself\nMy cousin Dory shot his girlfriend then shot himself in the head\nBefore I shoot myself, I'm shooting everyone else kid\nMy head aching, my hands shaking, I'm sweating bullets\nAnd it ain't even hot in this bitch, I'm going through it\nMy mind playing tricks on me, I mean, shit homie\nI might need a straitjacket fit for me\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nMy favorite uncle Roc got twisted 'til that liquor gave him sugar\nHad complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver\nTo me he\u2019s still the man cause see me I still remember\nThat lil\u2019 snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December\nI was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft\nEven with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass\nI got some money now so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him\nHe can have a fine nurse put that insulin needle to him\nCalled my son twice, he ain't picking up the phone\nAnd Banks, me and him don't even talk no more\nYou know cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack\nNever used no knife or had to squeeze no strap\nBut if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound\nFor cocaine distribution and letting off MAC rounds\nHome invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house\nTook them niggas paper and all of they packs out\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nThen I was in the second row the second time Em married Kim\nLooking at Proof like, \"How much you think this gon' cost them?\"\nFeels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me\nI rather a nigga just put a knife in me\nThan go through the emotions, the confusion and commotions\nNever die down in my head, they keep going\nIt feels like I'm God's punching bag on occasions\nAmazing, on other days, I feel like I'm His favorite\nI never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade\nWhen life feeding me lemons, I just make lemonade\nMy nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch\nLife without my old girl, I couldn't see that\nMy grandpa was the strongest, then he broke down and I broke down\nI looked around like if shit go bad now, who I'm gon' go to now?\nThat was his partner, see he knew everything about her\nNow he's saying he don't wanna live without her\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head"

   "lyrics": "[Produced by DJ Scratch]\n\n[Verse 1]\nRule number one: Don't go against the grain\nRule number two: Give respect where respect due\nRule number three: If you get knocked, play games and say names\nThe 45 will tear you out the frame\nIt's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fucking thing\nFor me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money brings\nMy style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail\nYou peoples got plenty money actin like they ain't got bail\nI feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme\nOr niggas in the mess hall gettin' chopped on chow lines\nAn old timer schooled me, said: \"Don't burn bridges, my friend\nImagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim\"\nI watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York\nMe and shorty stood from afar and had a talk\nHe said \"I told him if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word\nLook at his head, it's still shakin' - he had a lot of nerve\"\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo when the Feds come in the game, loyalty is limited\nHardcore niggas start actin' feminine\nWith the Feds you do eighty five percent of your time\nDuke, you get ten, you'll damn near do nine\nI hate a liar more than I hate thief\nA thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality\nThe streets I know'em like my ABC's\nStay away from the D's and stack ya' cheese\nTry to see three hundred G's before you see 300Z's\nTree top to feel the breeze, coke connect for key's\nYo' bitches sexin' me, take me to ecstacy\nOnce I nut, I don't want 'em next to me\nIf it's on, mother fucker, believe I'mma ride\nI'm the type to swallow my blood before I swallow my pride\nLetters on my sweater read DKNY\nGot grimy niggas runnin' with me from BKNY\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say I don't sound like a killer, well how a killer sound?\nI bet I grab a 4-pound and back that ass down\nSee many men live, baby, and many men die\nMany men get drunk, puff lye and stay high\nHere's a jewel: love your enemies and hate your friends\nYour enemies remain the same, friends always change\nI learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat\nYou can get 'em in the face, dog, or down his back\nAll bullshit aside now, its time to be honest\nI fear no man, for death is all that's promised\nI got niggas standin' in line waitin' to hear me spit\nFrom '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit\nThis for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine\nI hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine\nAin't nothin' changed in the game, but faces and names\nThe state, the weight, the date and the jake\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler"

New York!\nI run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy\nNiggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly\nOr sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really\nPussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli\nIn the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!\nNiggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}\nEvery bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Produced by Rockwilder]\n\n[Intro]\nD-D-Do you, do-do, do you think about me?\n\"Do you, do you, do you think about me?\nDo you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?\nDo you, do you, do you, do you think about me?\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYou think about money when you think about me, huh?\nIt's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her\nShe used to have the Beamer, now she own a sneaker\nI had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza\nI think about Easter when I think about Keyshia\nShorty stay fly, that's why I keep her\nRound like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa\nShe good if I leave her, she got her own Visa\nThink about them when you think about fronting\nThink about stunting when you think about me\nI'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?\nOverseas see jet ski's slide across\nI love the way you dress, now take it off\nPut your legs high on my shoulders of course\nI'm racing through your mind, but you already lost\nI'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine\nCome on, let's ride\n\n[Hook: Governor]\n(Do you think about me?)\nJust a little bit, every now and then\n(Do you think about me?)\nGoddamn girl, we used to be friends\n(Do you think about me?)\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\n(Do you think about me?)\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\n(Do you think about me?)\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment\nShe thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment\nIt's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head\nHe fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg\nShe ain't even have to run to get away with the bread\nThat's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid\nI'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court\nI pay my child support, what the fuck she want?\"\nThis relationship shit is too much for me\nI wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably\nShe wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's\nShe should have what she want, just not from me\nI'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past\nShe don't care about me, she just want some cash\nI'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends\nHow did shit become all about ends?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Governor]\nDo you think about me? (Do you think about me?)\nI know you think about me\nYou got to remember all the good times we had\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\nJust a little bit\n(Do you think about me?)\nI remember when you told me\n(I know you think about me)\nThat I'll always be special to you, darling\nYou were so special to me, do you think about me?"

I'm blowing a ten\nBecause Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison\nI'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps\nI'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack\nNow every morning's a fast start\nBut it ain't a problem getting dressed\nBecause my closet got more aisles than Pathmark\nRun when we starting a raid\nOr leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs\nI'm a young pimp, pardon my age\nI don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids\nNiggas find out what club they at, take them with us\nAnd run trains on them, like a subway map\nYour advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels\nGot most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper\nI go to college on the tour\nI'm going down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur\nKeep your ammo clean, TECs polished in the drawer\nCamera's by the hampers that monitor the floor\nBy now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery\nFlashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me\nBurglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy\nWhite tee burgundy, you match now, back down\nNiggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear\nCatch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear\nHeavy when I tote, C-notes from different years\nBezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs\nYou ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya\nI send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher\nYou better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive\nYou ain't getting nutting, but you french fries supersized\nIt's a damn shame y'all still local\nI'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga\n\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nYou still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere\nYou going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life\nAnd your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you\nSomething positive, alright:\nWell, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;\nYou ain't going nowhere\nGet yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}\nFucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}"

It's cold out here\nIt's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded\nIt's 50\nWhen I come through you see me\nIn the Suburbans that's bulletproof\nBomb proof, leather six, whatever\nWhen I go hard I go hard\nWhen I don't want you to see me I switch it up\nI'm in that black on black Porsche Panamera\nIn the back like ''ooh wee''\nWe rolling\nI hustle, man, it's what I do, man\nWait, niggas gon' try and tell me how to do this?"

It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy\nBut I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty\nWhy's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?\nThey say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie\nMan, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing\nI guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me\nI'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes\nThat just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me\nNiggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey\nYou can ask my son, he'll tell you \"my dad's fucking crazy\"\nShe filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me\nShady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me\nI'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me\nHe gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high\nIt makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die\nI wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try\nYou get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy lawyers on retainers every month, I give \u2018em stacks\nIn case they wanna send me up for murder like Max\nMan I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene\nSo if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me\nThere's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit\nThe more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid\nToday I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case\nThey said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face\nI spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home\nYou tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on\nWhen dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck\nSo you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider"

   "lyrics": "Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to 2Pac. People either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didn't like what he did. But whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\n\nMy favorite 2Pac album is The Don Killuminati. It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper. That's something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space. Everybody knows that they're going to die. But after you're in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.\n\n2Pac's aggressive records are my favorite. \"Hail Mary\" is just perfect: \"Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted.\" Most artists now just aren't smart enough to write that, or honest enough to write a line like, \"I ain't a killer but don't push me.\" These days rappers will just tell you, \"I'll kill you.\"\n\n2Pac was like a camera. It's incredible how much he wrote \u2014 how much he documented. To me, 'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper. You can always tell when you're hearing 2Pac verse. He wrote those lyrics without any music. Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven \u2014 I'm sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music \u2014 but 'Pac was just hashing out his life. The thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and that's when things got out of control.\n\nAll of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac. The music was all that mattered. That East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef. Now that he's not here, he's bigger than ever. I can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight. Sometimes I put on 2Pac's best songs, followed by Biggie's best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.\n\nLaurence Fishburne told me once that he didn't like 2Pac. He told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didn't like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better. I understood what he meant. But I still gave him a look like he was bugging."

What!\n\n[Hook]\nProjects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock\nCause then we gonna run up in your spot\nScreamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw\n(Repeat)\n\n[Verse 2 - Nature]\nAiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo\nI'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef\nYou're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three\nNext to Ron Artest and Kobe\nYo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me\nI'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump\nBreathin' deeper when I'm creeping up\nYa'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas\nEncephalitis leavin' whole families in silence\nMy virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends\nUn cured, ain't no vaccine\nLast seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out\nOr in the studio booth, blacking out\nIt's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit\nComin' back I'm rich kid\nEither or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door\nOr walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga\n\n[Hook - Last line cut off]\n\n\"Niggas bit off Nas\" - Ghostface Killah\n\"Admit it, you bit it\" - G. Dep\n\"Tell these niggas somethin' God\" - Ghostface Killah\n\n[Verse 3 - Nas]\nWhat, yo\nI disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars\nTatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan\nFrom Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong\nWe smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack\nThose that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me\nFeds search the God, but nothin' they find on me\nWhen I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner\nUnless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you\nPorsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers\nStinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure\nRims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions\n22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'\nImpotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like\nYou knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike\n50 Cent with Braveheart-ed, we ride to the grave depart us\nYou fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go\n\n[Intro - Once]\n\n[Hook]"

I'm limitless, I just took the pill\nWhy you think a nigga slow flow so ill?\nBe careful, the shit I got is highly contagious\nWe hustled 'til it had us all locked up in cages\nTime gon' fly when niggas been bidding for ages\nWar stories and wounds, back and forth, a nigga been trading\nFor the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan\nWe from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making\nI guess it's all risk versus rewards\nA nigga risk it all for the broads\n(What's up?)\n\n[Hook: Guordan Banks]\nAre you ready to win?\nCome join the winners circle\nPut up your hands for me, baby\nAnd do it like we're supposed to\nCause we're gonna win\n\nCome join the winners circle\nPut up your hands for me, baby\nAnd do it like we're supposed to\nCause we're gonna win"

Nigga is there.. is there a motherfuckin' problem nigga?)\n(Oh, yeah that's what I, I thought so.. pussy!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNiggas be talkin 'bout me, they always callin' me crazy\nFuck them OG niggas, they stuck in the 80's\nSayin they gon' do me somethin', now you know that's a lie\nNigga you look at me wrong I let the hammer fly\nI'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind\nQueens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime\nWhen I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire\nI prevents runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on the barbed wire\nThis shit's crazy, it's just a different day it's the same shit\nHollow-tip partin' yo' head, leave your whole fuckin' brain split\nThey sick, they see me in that Aston Martin\nWhat's the matter? They can't get that hooptie started\nThought they was grindin', well God damn, where that money at?\nThought you was fucked up, cause you was lettin' paper stack\nYou ain't a hustler, matter fact, you's a buster\nI don't trust ya, I should send niggas to touch ya\n\n[Chorus]\nI tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face\n'Cause I don't need 'em\n'Cause they're, never around, when I'm down\nShot and I'm bleedin'\n\n[Outro]\nWhat? Who say they gon' do somethin' to me?\nMust be out your rabbit-ass mind\nFuck around kill one of these niggas"

All year long\nIt's back to 50, you already know\nGet the money, and shut the fuck up\nWatch me do what I'm doing cause niggas can't stop nothing that I'm doing\nNothing I'm doing\nRight after you get in the way we gon' start shooting again like it's nothing changed\nWe went through that whole \"Kumbaya my lord - let's be friends by the fire\"\nShit, it's over, nigga\nBack to the script, you know how this shit go\nHow much is that?\nOooh, if you could see me right now, I got a alligator on, nigga\nYou, you think it should go different?

I got so much more to offer\nI'mma make 'em watch me be #1 'til I'm done, yeah\n\n[Hook]\n\n[50 Cent (+ Governor)]\nThey bringin me all, the way dowwwwwn\n(Everybody's tryin to bring me all the way down)\nAnd betray me just becauuuuse (betray me) I'm down (just because)\nI, don't know, what, to do nowwwww (I don't know what to do)\nMe? My loyalty's, what I'm 'bout\nHa ha (that just happens to be what I'm about)\nThey burn me, over and over and over (over and over again)\nLike they doin what they supposed ta\nThey burn me, goddamn look at how they do me (look at how they do me)\nSomebody new tryin to sue me\nSo they burn me (after all I've done)\nSo they burn me\n(Seems like I can't find a friend, every time they burn)"

You is tired out? Why you ain't get around to that?\nYou wander, I travel, I have a destination\nI'll be a street legend new version of Pappy Mason\nMy style? It'll never die, boy I'm immortal\nYou shoot me down, I'll get back up and keep coming for you\nMan on fire, hitman for hire\nThem niggas got happy they thought I was gon' retire\nNow they bitch giving me head, I'm the man, a man admires\nWhat's up?\n\n[Hook:]"

Drop that\nPaper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop\nG-Unit -- something new\n\n[Intro]\nI'm not that nigga in your video\nI'm not a trick, I don't love the hoes\nAnd niggas know I be on the low\nWhen I gets my dough and I twist my dro\nI'm not that nigga that you think you know\nI walk around with a big fo-fo\nYou front on me I'm gon' get at you, dawg\nI be right at your crib waiting at your door\n(What up 50!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nComing up I ain't have much, I wanted a lot\nI had paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop\nSo you know I had to make something out of nothing\nLike turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumping\nHustled hard, at nineteen I bought a Benz, I did\nThe older niggas really wasn't feeling the kid\nTrying to find where I live so they could run in my crib\nBut you can't hustle a hustler, I peeped it and slid\nBack then niggas used to call me Boo\nIn six months I sold a million gold tops on Guy Brewer\nCountry came around, he's into clapping and\nCountry left, same shit started happening\nLike, \"He shot Rob for some ends, Rob shot Joe over some skins\nCory shot you and we was friends, money turned boys into men\"\nThe cycle never changes, shit just starts again\n\n[Interlude]\nNaw, nigga, ain't nothing changed, nigga\nYeah, I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Damn 50, good to see you back in the hood)\nYou see my cherry red SL, nigga -- I'm doing good\nSometimes I can't find the words to say how I feel\nSo I take a quote from Menace -- \"look at the wheels\"\nI'm addicted to stunting now that I'm holding something\nI got a trunk full of guns from VA today\n(Oh, nigga, let me hold something?)\nNigga you high or something?\nI don't play games, I'm bout my money, nigga -- buy something\nI got a few 5ths, I got a few 9's\nHere nigga take one, catch a jux and bring me mine\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, don't ever say I don't do nothing for you, nigga\nYou know, don't say I didn't look out for you, knowhatImean?\nBut make sure, nigga, that you go catch some jux\nWhen you come back you gonna have my paper for that thang thang, knowhatI'msayin?\nI don't want it back nigga, don't try to use it then give it back to me\nCause I could see y'all niggas now running around saying\n\"50 getting all this rap money and he won't help us\"\nSit tight, nigga, I'm coming, you know? New shit\nAll the shit I put out on the mixtapes is for the mixtapes\nI got a million\nOh my God -- my shit is so hot right now; I'm in the zone"

(that ain't gangsta)\nYour man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)\nRockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)\nYou only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)\nNiggas juxed you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)\nYou ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)\nNiggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)\nIf you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou'd call me Animal if you seen me livin' on lock\nI stay in a box so much it seems like I'm visitin' pop-ulation\nWhen I walk by, niggas like \"Fifty don't play son\"\n\"yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga...\"\nMax out, I'm goin' straight for the Glock\nBust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block\nThe things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat\nDown goes the window....out goes the heat\nI'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet\nSome get it in the leg, some get it in the back\nSome get it in the foot, bleed all over their Air Max\nNigga pump my packs or pay poor tax\nIt's extortion, it happens in the hood often\nClaim more lives than choices, free abortions\nRich Nice says I got a problem with the dice\nCause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice\nI rock shit cause I stay on that block shit\nThat 9mm Ruger to your knot shit\nSee the difference is I'm real and you not, kid\nI still stash crack money in my sock, shit\nYa'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips\nLeave with your blood on my mink in the drop six\nGuiliani and Pataki can't stop this\nSince '86 my whole clique pop Criss\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\n5-5-1 BRRRAAAT BRRRAAAT\n1-3-4 BRRRAAAT BRRRAAAT\nWhat the fuck you know about that?"

We fucked with the same bitch\nGetting money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary\nAnd I'm saying that house should be a crack house\nNow see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out\nThe tech and the mac out, the Sig and the Taurus\nThe Koch and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin'\nI let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign\nClick-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded\nToss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it\n'Til it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nCome get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it\nCome get it - huh?

You gotta be strapped to get rid of me\nI'll leave you in water like the Statue of Liberty\nI'm tryin to be cool\nBlowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school\nKeep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for Benzes\nAnd long assault rifles with straps on the lenses\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nYall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)\nWhat I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un-Huh)\nYall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)\nWhat I learned from watching Brucie B\nLook, I shot the sheriff\nAnd nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot\nHere's the plan, I'm a keep stackin' my ends\nTill I'm on airplane seats in the Maybach benz\nI'm all about the chips\nI done took them trips\n22's on the 6\n26 on the bricks\nAnd them outta town niggas, I'm chargin' yall more\nI tapdance on the shit I ain't servin' it raw\nYou sell smoke, look, nigga, I got what you need\nBut it ain't goin' cheap I got mouths to feed\nNiggas always sayin' damn 50 you bugged\nCause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug\nGimme his watch and his chain\nWe not the same, he a lame\nHe want pussy I'm bout my money man\nCrap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick\nThrew a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed\nYo it's 50, when your mindframe change and start to rearrange\nI'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50\nShots 'til your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out"

   "lyrics": "[50 Cent]\nHold up\nSon them niggas know who hit that nigga son (I know, I know)\nThey - how the fuck, we gon' know who hit him, and they don't know who hit him?\nThe hood talkin man, e'rybody know~! (I know, it's fucked up)\n\n[Intro]\nNow I lay thee down to sleep\nNiggas try and lay me down wit heat\nAnd if I should die though before I awake\nI pray my Lord my soul to take\n\n[50 Cent]\nIf dead men could talk in your sleep your homey told you who got him\nWould you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him? (Huh?)\nOr would you start switchin up\nYou thinkin 'bout the penitentiary and bitchin up?\nWhat if he said money ain't everything, the hood raised us wrong\nAll jux'll get your money long but look here I'm gone\nWould that touch your heart? Have you feelin funny inside?\nWould that be enough to make your punk-ass ride?\nWhat if he gave you a little list of things to do?\nSaid he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you\nWould you load the gats, and get ready ro ride\nOr would you lock the door at yo' crib and hide?\nIt's a cold world even when it's hot outside\nWhether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain\nHit him cause he was your strength, now you in a daze\nYour homey turnin over in his grave... cause you PUSSY!\n\n[Hook: repeat 2X]\n\"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up\" - B.I.G. {*repeat 3X*}\n\"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up with the lugers from they Rugers or they Desert\"\n(RIGHT~!!)\n\n[50 Cent]\nThem boys smoked your homey, ye ain't gon' do nuttin back?\nNot even if he told you you next to get clapped?\nIt don't take much for them shells to make the best of you\nYour peoples gon' probably cremate and burn the rest of you\nYou done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven\nNigga is you down for this 1-8-7?\nWhen you reach the pearly gates, how you gon' explain\nYou gon' try and tell God you've been framed?\nY'all did everything together, he was your dog\nNow you Uptown coppin, and he in the morgue\nThem niggas he gave packs to, they kept the cake\nHis sister and his baby momma talkin to Jake (uh-huh)\nNiggas that rocked him, they came to the wake\nBut they ain't come inside, they sat out in the ride\nAt the funeral, homicide all in the business\nWalkin 'round askin niggas to tell 'em who did it\nNiggas is throwin blows now you ready to rumble?\nThirsty niggas are animals, the hood is a jungle\nBroke nigga'll body somethin over a bundle\nMan a three-year-old kid in my hood know what a gun do\n\n[Hook] - repeat 'til 15 seconds left\n\n[Outro]\nSha Money, XL!\nShadyville, teamwork, music"

Hmm, should\ufeff I?\nGhetto as I wanna be, I say \"What up dude?\"\nWhen I breach you serve you bricks, through time to beat you\nSend you back if you headed to your people\nThrew out my chest when I make power moves like I'm right on the L\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou wanna, party with me, come on, party with me\nOh, you don't wanna party with me, it's aight with me\nShorty, what's your favorite champagne, Cristal, Moet or Dom P?\nLighten up, get a bottle boo, but it ain't on me\nI'm caught up, in my ghetto way of thinking\nFrom the ice, to the minks, to the champagne we drinking\nBig boys is playing Benzos with AMG kits and 20 inch Lorenzos\nFollow me, round and round, the club\n3 and a quarter drop-tops with hard tops\n20 whips for chip; that's it. Average joes who flip bricks\nMy team flash keys like they grow on trees\nWhen it's hot, park the whips and ride bikes\nIf you [?] through traffic on the turn-bikes, aight"

   "lyrics": "[Produced by Trackmasters]\n\n[Intro]\nYo, I'd like to dedicate this to my mom, Sabrina Jackson\nGod bless her soul\nWe gon' get it on in here; nothing but real shit\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, shorty ain't a shorty no more; shorty be wil'ing\nShorty adolescent ass belong on the island\nI went from riding big wheels to wanting to be a big Willy\nFound interest in drug dealers and cold-hearted killers\nCould it be it's in my blood cause my mom sold drugs?\nShe used to bust slugs and surround herself by thugs\nMade mistakes by showing them love\nAnd they killed her\nSome friends never came to pay respects, so fuck Hilda\nYou know how friends do friends - like Tony did Manolo\nThe type of fast shit that Henry did in Good Fellas\nSome snakes don't show up to weights cause they backs is yellow\nWhen you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the team\nSee, niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme\nFor all you slow muthafuckers, I'mma break it down iller\nSee, 'Preme was a business man - you guess who the killer\nRemember? He used to push the bulletproof BM (uh huh)\nHis hair'll get you seasick; I sat back and peeped shit\nThey roll with E-Z Wider, and they ain't get blunted\nHad the whole projects working for fifty or five hundred\nWhat about bug, who trade and them niggas had cheese?\nIn the late 80s push Mercedes\nAnd Maseratis, kept reserved spaces at the horse races\nWhere they met Columbian connections like Lucho and Mariella\nThen bookoo bucks on the horses; they used to cook and flip bricks\nFaster than the jet flip flap jack and pack gats\nNiggas said Ds was dipping, burned his face with acid\n'Til this day, they would say the mothefucker's gasted\n\n[Hook]\nIt's my confession; I make corrections; I strive for perfection\nI try to be the best in, whatever I do; I'm telling you\nThis is my confession; I'm teaching niggas a lesson\nCause they can't do, what I do; here's my confession\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, a lot of New York blocks are only bringing pennies in\nI stand beef - too many cheaps; too little fucking Indians\nToo many sips of the brew will make you do what we do\nPlay with insecurities, until we start fussing and cussing\nFrustration builds - few lose, and fist fights leave niggas busting\nNot only do we have to look out and avoid encounters with Jake\nGotta look out and avoid encounters with snakes\nNiggas who fake and play both sides of the gate\nI squeeze Boyz II Men for they cheese like Michael Bivins\nSlip with half a big nigga cap like Robert Givens\nComing up I heard sipping too much booze will leave you confused\nAnd if you watch the news, you'll see some players in this game and lose\nNiggas think they together; they ain't together at all\nStand on the block together, but divided they fall\nA lot of niggas locked down and ain't got nobody to call\nAnd a player ain't the same player when he can't ball\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me - the type that keep the bricks flipping\nJewels dripping, the margarita sipping - description\nNappy blowouts shaped up, brown-skinned\nAnd ask the hood rats about my dick; the chickens recommend it\nI make statements like \"Try me if you want\"\nPresentation: cool and calm - words as if I'm daring ya\nUsually roll with a 2 shot .25 derringer\nI'm not an actor; my life's not a movie\nI never worked with the Fugees\nI'm not killing you softly; pack a small gat just to back you up off me\nBut later when things simmer and all sin ceases\nMy peoples will see to it that you rest in peace in pieces\nKill or be killed - it's what the hood teaches\nNever go to church so the preachers can't reach us\nAnd if we do, it's only on Easter\n\n[Hook]"

Nigga, I got a chopper\nMines ain't got no wheels, what's the deal?\nPropellers propel, I'm on the top of New York\nTop of the food chain, nigga, talking my talk\nSuccess is my addiction, you should take a hit of this {HAHA!}\nI'm down for the friction, you start it I'll finish it\nVictim? Pick 'em - knife work, stick 'em\nChrome Colt, pop 'em - hollow tip, drop 'em\nIt won't be long 'fore you're going dying now, watch 'em\n(Come on!

I gotta put this shit on tape man, 4 bitches at the same time man, there's a difference when you just got 4 bitches, there just is. You or when you got 4 bitches that are just dead, really get into it, start being there for themselves, you know what I mean? I talk A bitch into anything man. You gotta listen o me man, I'm good at this man, yous don't be listenin' man. That's why you ain't got no money man. Put your hands in your pockets right now. You know why you ain't got no money? Cause you don't listen to 50. Stupid nigga, I'm tellin' ya to pay attention man. Watch me man, hunh? Niggas know what i'm sayin'. I'm off the same curb you are. Why I got a hundred mill' and you ain't got nuttin', huh?"

Across the world\nLeaving trails of hoes that got they heart broke\nI puff the dark smoke, usually, mix it with greens, look what it do to me:\nHave me fucked up before puberty\nIf I had one wish and the shit'll come true\nA nigga live to be a hundred and two\nAll I need is a two-pay, call it a new day\nImmigrant prostitutes like \"papa how much you pay?\"\nGot to lose weight, niggas say I'm way too big\nBad habits, call a shop, and stay way too jigg, motherfucker"

   "lyrics": "After battling with his major label for years, 50 Cent has decided to become an independent artist.\n\nThe rapper announced Thursday that he's leaving his longtime record label, Universal Music Group's Interscope Records, and Eminem's imprint, Shady/Aftermath.\n\nThe Grammy winner and his G-Unit Records have signed a distribution agreement with Caroline, the independent label at Capital Music Group. Capitol is one of the many labels that are part of Universal Music Group.\n\n50 Cent launched an ultra-successful, six-times platinum debut with \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" in 2003, when he burst on the music scene with Eminem as his mentor. His sophomore album, 2005's \"The Massacre\" was almost as successful, but other albums didn't match his previous efforts and he expressed his unhappiness with his label. 50 Cent had been planning to release a fifth album on the label, but it was set with multiple release dates and singles, and eventfully didn't see a release.\n\nHis last album was 2009's \"Before I Self Destruct,\" which also had several release dates.\n\n\"I have had great success to date with Shady/Aftermath/Interscope and I'd like to thank Eminem and Dr. Dre for giving me an incredible opportunity,\" 50 Cent said in a statement. \"I've learned so much from them through the years. I am excited to enter this new era where I can carry out my creative vision.\"\n\n50 Cent had a plethora of hits early in his career that dominated the pop, rap and R&B charts, from \"P.I.M.P.\" to \"Candy Shop\" to the anthemic \"In da Club,\" which introduced the young rapper aside Dr. Dre and Eminem.\n\n\"Both myself and Shady Records are grateful to have had the chance to play a part in 50's career,\" Eminem said in a statement. \"Shady simply would not be what it is without 50 Cent. I've developed a great friendship with 50 over the years, and that's not going to change. We know 50 will have success in his new situation, and we remain supporters of both him and G-Unit.\"\n\nThe rapper, born Curtis Jackson, has also been a success outside of music, from film roles to fashion to books.\n\n50 Cent's new album, \"Animal Ambition,\" will be released June 3. Caroline has recently distributed albums by Korn and rapper E-40.\n\n(Report by ABC News)"

Fuck that nigga [?]. Well this is Southside man. It ain't gonna change. Naaaaaw. You know its gonna get worse before it gets better. Trust me\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's not me and my bitch, it's me and my six\nMe and my P90, and two of them clips\nHolla at me, my niggas put it in for the chips\nThey'll kill for the bricks, turn em in to the whips\nWith the shiny shoes, you know how they do\nIt's not just a job, it's a hobby too\nI'm bred for this, I was born into it\nBefore I could walk the talk a nigga momma would do it\nStash dope in the diaper, ratchet in my stroller\nI was born a gangsta nigga, now remember I told ya\nSo when I'm back packing my ratchet, im back on the strip\nI'm back flippin, trippin and smacking a bitch\nDon't be suprised or mesmerized how I'm on it\nNigga front and you can get it, now how you want it?\nWith the razor, with the knife, with the pistol, with the ice\nPick is so big, it should depart you tricks\nShit\n\n[Outro]\nShit crazy out here man. It's hot man, niggas ain't getting no fucking money. I can tell when they looking at me they like \"Yo Fifty man, help me man\". They crying for help baby. I come through, they like \"Whaddup\". You know what I mean? They see me baby, I'm with the top down, I got the AC blowing. I'm like \"Yo, whatup nigga, nah hell no I ain't stopping. Ah-ha-ha. What you want to talk to me about nigga? No I ain't got no help for you, I'll let you hold something. Nigga, I'll let you hold a hollow tip nigga. I'm not letting you hold nothing else nigga, cause I can't remember these niggas letting me hold nothing.\" If something wrong with that niggas ain't never letting me borrow nothing!

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSome friends turn foes over money and hoes\nWhen they family ain't tight, and they money ain't right\nWhen you party with me, you party all night\nCause I ain't with doing nothing if we ain't doing it right\nPlaya haters, when they getting face-to-face altercations\nThey be getting played like Sony PlayStation\nWhen the feds having fun, cockblockers try to stop me\nAnd thirsty cats be in the background trying to clap me\nI see them when they start scheming\nI know what they thinking of\nMad at us for being players\nAnd they can't get no love (I see you, playa)\nWhat it boil down to, cause my flow's hot\nYour flow... hmmm, your flow's not\nYou're so-so going against 50 Cent, that's a no-no\nY'all know better than that\n\n[Hook]\nFlowers blooming, morning dew, and the cats just ain't the same\nIt's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true in the game\nEasy living while we're pimping what we know we're dreaming of\nWe are one having fun walking in the glow of a thug\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst it was me and my pistol, but since the last mistrial\nSpin up a Cristal, I'm living it up\nMy lawyer, K.O.'d the case, checked the lawbook for my name\nI sit in courtrooms and throw signs like I'm a Mason\nMoney is power, envy is cash, breed evil\nI could be robbed with the jewels I drop\nCame into the store a year ago, I decided to stack chips on the whip\nPush the hoot, now I be sitting on Beach Huevo\nContemplating coping the Coupe... Hmm, should\ufeff I?\nGhetto as I wanna be, I say \"What up dude?\"\nWhen I breach you serve you bricks, through time to beat you\nSend you back if you headed to your people\nThrew out my chest when I make power moves like I'm right on the L\n\n[Hook]\nFlowers blooming, morning dew, and the cats just ain't the same\nIt's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true in the game\nEasy living while we're pimping what we know we're dreaming of\nWe are one having fun walking in the glow of a thug\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou wanna party with me, come on, party with me\nOh, you don't wanna party with me, it's aight with me\nShorty, what's your favorite champagne, Cristal, Moet or Dom P?\nLighten up, get a bottle boo, but it ain't on me\nI'm caught up, in my ghetto way of thinking\nFrom the ice, to the minks, to the champagne we drinking\nBig boys is playing Benzos with AMG kits and 20 inch Lorenzos\nFollow me, round and round, the club\n3 and a quarter drop-tops with hard tops\n20 whips for chip; that's it\nAverage joes who flip bricks\nMy team flash keys like they grow on trees\nWhen it's hot, park the whips and ride bikes\nIf you woolying through traffic on the turn-bikes, aight\n\n[Hook]\nFlowers blooming, morning dew, and the cats just ain't the same\nIt's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true in the game\nEasy living while we're pimping what we know we're dreaming of\nWe are one having fun walking in the glow of a thug"
