  "plain": "Bobby Ray Simmons, Jr. has released over 21 bodies of work, that along with countless features, chart-toppers, and production-credits highlights just how hardworking this southeastern artist truly is.\n\n\n\nHis musical output began in 2007, releasing 3 projects that year, as well as the following year. Then, in 2009, B.o.B released B.o.B Vs. Bobby Ray, and was made an XXL Freshman, however he\u2019d not even started to see success. That is, until the Bruno Mars assisted #1 single \u201cNothin' On You\u201d was released \u2013 one of the many successful singles from his debut album B.o.B Presents The Adventures of Bobby Ray, which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Charts. The album also received favourable reviews and 5 Grammy nominations (one for \u201cAirplanes, Pt 2 (feat. Eminem & Hayley Williams)\u201d \u2013 Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals).\n\nAfter this amount of success many would take a well-earned hiatus, but not B.o.B. Before 2010\u2019s end he released his beloved mixtape No Genre. Less than a year later he released another well received mixtape, E.P.I.C. (Every Play is Crucial), which was composed of songs of the excess songs he couldn\u2019t fit on his sophomore album, Strange Clouds.\n\nUnfortunately, his incredible run of mainstream success couldn\u2019t last, with his following album,  Underground Luxury, receiving little attention from radio. Since however, his output hasn\u2019t diminished, with 5 mixtapes released since his 3rd studio album \u2013 this output may\u2019ve even been greater if it hadn\u2019t been for him founding his label \u2018No Genre\u2019 (after his mixtape), and helping to establish his roster.\n\n\n\nWhatever anyone may have to say about B.o.B, no one can deny he is one of the hardest working in the industry."

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nAlready got one, rolled up in my left hand\nPussy on my mind, tighter than a headband\nKush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands\nThis shit I'm on, better than the next strand\nThan the next strand, better than the next strand\nShe head down, booty poppin' in a handstand\nI shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan\nI make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man\nI don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man\nIf she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback\nLike a cornerback, that's an interception\nYou think I give a fuck, that's a misconception\nOh what a night, oh what a night\nThe roof is on fire, so what? I'm high\nI said, oh what a night, oh what a night\nYeah she a bad bitch, all jokes aside\n\n[Hook]\nHey, look at baby over there\nWassup, little mama come here\nShe started talking but I really couldn't hear\nUntil she started dancing like she do it in the mirror\nLike she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror\nShe broke it down started moving like Shakira\nLike she do it in the mirror\n\nChop one, chop two, chop that ass down\nChop that ass down, chop chop that ass down\nAll I want you to do is just drop that ass down\nDrop drop that ass down, now look back at it\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nWhistling Dixie\nMiddle school, I was getting head on a ten speed\nGigolo blood line, pimpin' hereditary\nBlack on 28's, it remind of February\nDay you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary\nDead ass rapper should have came with a cemetery\nI am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry\nFill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary\nMy vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'\nI've been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin'\nSo I closed the curtains on the 62\nHer ass would knock your ass out, you better stick and move\nChain hang to my ding-a-ling\nChain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling\nTo do a threesome you gotta intervene\nHer legs so sexy when I'm in-between\n\n[Hook]\nHey, look at baby over there\nWassup, little mama come here\nShe started talking but I really couldn't hear\nUntil she started dancing like she do it in the mirror\nLike she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror\nShe broke it down started moving like Shakira\nLike she do it in the mirror\n\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B]\nShe do it like she do it in the mirror\nBe cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears\nShe speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears\nI'm looking for the baddest one here\nI tell her like, do that there, do that there\nYou gotta stretch it out, girl move that there\nShe bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there\nLike hut one, hut two, girl who back there?\nWho back there? I'm back there\nI could take a step back and sip my cognac there\nPicture perfect body, that's a Kodak there\nNow make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there\nI'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night\nThe roof is on fire, so what? I'm high\nI'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night\nThat's a bad bitch, all jokes aside\n\n[Hook]\nHey, look at baby over there\nWassup, little mama come here\nShe started talking but I really couldn't hear\nUntil she started dancing like she do it in the mirror\nLike she do it in the mirror, like she do it in the mirror\nShe broke it down started moving like Shakira\nLike she do it in the mirror"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Morgan Freeman]\nAs the war between light and darkness continues\nHeroes and villains become harder to identify\nKindred spirits separated at birth\nFighting for their place in time to be solidified\nThe clock ticks faster and faster\nWhile time runs a marathon in this Babylon\nBut see, the end is only the beginning\nThe beginning of the calm before the storm\n\n[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nI used to dream of success, now success is inadequate\nIt seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me\nCause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling\nAnd it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it\nAnd I swear it's like a fucked up reality\nBut creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate\nI guess, and I ain't too big on duality but\nYou think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me\nSo fly: no gravity, so high: Mount Everest\nAnd the show must go on, yes, but I don't have to act in it\nAnd they don't make a television that handles the frequencies\nOf my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it\nIt just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening\nYou hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga, we mastered it\nY'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes\nDrink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we catholics\nAnd if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador\nOfficial, no artificial preservatives or additives\nI love it all but I ain't attached to it\nThey call this a game because it is exactly\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nAnd it seems like in the grand scheme of it all\nThe world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all\nHow do they exist if we don't know who they are?\nThey can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods\nSome say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all\nFrom a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve\nBut if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed\nAnd whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge\nFuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want\nYou could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold\nAnd in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all\nIf you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?\nMan I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far\nNow I be beasting up on these bars\nFreak out a beat and then beat it out raw\nGood God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety\nI won't need viagra nah, even if I had a dog\nI be the canine, I'd have a ball\nBetter watch out when you cross my yard\nI am a flame, I am the spark\nI am in drive, y'all are in park\nLook at my shot, look at the arc\nLook at the crowd as soon as I start\nLook in they eyes and look in they hearts\nTwo middle fingers straight at the law\nSincerely yours, so pray to your lord\nCause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords\nUFOs don't make any noise\nWhen they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\n\n[Outro: Morgan Freeman]\nAs the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity\nUnveiling the grim reality of duality\nIn which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt\nTruth has many shades\nIt's not a matter of black and white, but gray\nAlthough many, we are one, so in the final analysis\nCould it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYeah, you ain't seen my best\nCheckmate, ain't a game of chess\nGlobalists see me as a threat\nFree thinking, got a world at my neck\nHah, am I paranoid? Picture Malcolm X\nIn a room full of pigs, trying not to bust a sweat\nAye, Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest\nThey probably write that man one hell of a check\nAye, I'm over here on this side of town\nCome on over, over, over, over here, try to clown\nAye, I never pipe down\nIf they weren't coming for me then\nThey definitely coming for me now\nI can't even keep my phone charged up\nAll this shit I'm talking, I should get my home barred up\nRappers get off of my dick and get your own bars up\nNow the mirror lizard's breath got the clones scared cuz\nWoo, use your, use your common sense\nWhy is NASA part of the department of defense?\nThey divided up the seas into thirty-three degrees\nFeeding kids masonry, bruh, be careful what you read\n\n[Hook 1]\nFlat line, flat line\nThere's no superior blood line\nFlat line, flat line\nYou got me once but that died, aye\n\n[Verse 2]\nVoice, voice, do I have a voice?\nDo I give a fuck? Do I have a choice?\nJoint, joint, I roll up a joint\nKeep my shooters in the game like I hate to disappoint\nI see only good things on the horizon\nThat's probably why the horizon is always rising\nIndoctrinated in a cult called science\nAnd graduated to a club full of liars\nHeliocentrism, you were the sixth victim\nFuck you and your team, you can sit on the bench with 'em\nThey nervous, but before you try to curve it\nDo your research on David Irving\nStalin was way worse than Hitler\nThat's why the POTUS gotta wear a kippah\nI'm a man first 'fore an artist\nGet a lawyer, look up Doctor Richard Sauder\n\n[Hook 2]\nFlat line\nYou fooled us for the last time\nFlat line, flat line\nThere's no superior blood line\n\n[Interlude: Neil Tyson]\nSo you want to find the farthest point from that center. And it turns out sea level at the equator is farther away from the center of the Earth than sea level near the poles. It has nothing to do with global warming and melting of the ice caps\n\n(Why is that?)\n\nBecause... Earth, we know it spins, once a.... day. Yes, thank you. Three people know that, how long a day lasts here\n\n(Good for row number two, they're off to a great start)\n\nSo you, so you spin, you know when you spin pizza dough, it kind of flattens out. It gets wider in the middle and...so Earth, throughout its life, even when it formed, it was spinning, and it got a little wider at the equator than it does at the poles. So it's not actually a sphere, it's an...it's oblate, it's officially an oblate spheroid. That's what we call it. But not only that, it's slightly wider below the equator than above the equator\n\n(A little chubbier?)\n\nLittle chubbier, chubby's a good word, it's like pear-shaped. So it turns out the pear-shapedness is bigger than the height of Mount Everest above sea level\n\n[Hook 2]\nFlat line\nYou fooled us for the last time\nFlat line, flat line\nThere's no superior blood line\nDead"

I\u2019m just askin'\nWhat\u2019s the pattern to the madness?\nEverybody ain\u2019t a number one draft pick\nMost of us ain\u2019t Hollywood actors\nBut if it\u2019s all for one, and one for all\nThen maybe one day, we all could ball\nDo it one time for the underdogs\nSincerely yours, from one of y'all\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift]\nI wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us\nSome day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle\nYou just wanna live, but everything's so low\nThat you could drown in a puddle\nThat\u2019s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up\nFor all the times no one\u2019s ever spoke for us\nTo every single time that they play this song\nYou can say that that\u2019s what Bobby Ray wrote for us\nWhen the tides get too high\nAnd the sea up underneath gets so deep\nAnd you feel like you\u2019re just another person\nGetting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds\nUh, because we've both been there, both of us\nBut we still stand tall with our shoulders up\nAnd even though we always against the odds\nThese are the things that\u2019ve molded us\nAnd if life hadn\u2019t chosen us\nSometimes I wonder where I would've wound up\n'Cause if it was up to me, I\u2019d make a new blueprint\nThen build it from the ground up, hey\nBut if it\u2019s all for one, and one for all\nThen maybe one day, we all could ball\nDo it one time for the underdogs\nFrom Bobby Ray, to all of y\u2019all\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift]\nI wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us\nSome day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us"

   "lyrics": "[Hook]\nHow much must I repeat? We only play for keeps\nNo time-outs, no free throws, no refs, no penalties\nNo handouts, no pit stops, no cheat codes, no sleep\nBut the drinks are on us, if you with it then pull up a seat\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen you\u2019re roaming through the jungle talk is nothing, talk is cheap\nTime is money, money is power, power corrupts eventually, damn\nSo what are the options? What are the choices left for me?\nWhat other rule is left to break? I guess my fate is a quest for me\nMan I\u2019m a dog that ain\u2019t got no leash\nMan got a crib, it ain\u2019t got no lease\nMan got a flow that ain't got no brain\nBut I still get brain, no hands no teeth, uh\nNowadays, niggas are killas on the beat\nBut where I was raised all of the killas was down the street\nBetter do your research\nFeeling like I fell out of the sky and landed feet first\nMy squad go hard, my squad go concrete, watch my team work\nHell yea, you can tell that the boy finna eat cause I took my seat first\n3 course meal, full entr\u00e9e, refills and I want my dessert\nSo why not make a toast? Tomorrow could always be worse\nNow keep them bottles coming by the kiloliter\nAnd get that Ana off your chest, try to keep a clean shirt\nI\u2019m so Grand Hustle, you ain\u2019t even in my league sir\nWhat\u2019s up with these nerds?\nThey be out here, gettin\u2019 their salads tossed, gettin\u2019 their leaves turned\nThe game just ain\u2019t what it used to be, the quality is blurred\nBut a dying breed survives and a dynasty emerged\nSo put it in the air if you entirely concur\nShe call me hippie cause I live without any concern\nUp on this green earth, I\u2019m on them green herbs\nYeah yeah, yeah, I stay in them trees like the Keeblers\nAnd they say that I look higher in person\nAs a kid I played in the yard, but now I\u2019m astro turfing\nI lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter\nMade up stories of threesomes, they must just be seeing double\nRun for cover, here comes trouble\nMy heart is going cold so I gotta sleep with warmer covers\nPolar bear pimpin\u2019, solar flare spittin\u2019\nSomebody tell \u2018em that this is professional stuntin\u2019, don\u2019t attempt it\nSociety is twisted, they tryna take us under\nSo when you see them folks, don\u2019t forget to warn a brother\nI made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle\nVeni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered\nThey mad cause I murdered the game\nAnd their name wasn\u2019t in the will\nYou see, most of these haters are mad rappers who just still waiting on a deal\nAnd they jealous of my success cause my shoes cost more than a bill\nBut I\u2019ll never sit down at another table unless I\u2019m invited to the meal\nTo some it\u2019s like conquering mountains, to me it\u2019s like stepping on hills\nRemember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear\nAnd the truth can be hard to swallow, depends on the size of the pill\nAnd by the looks it\u2019s about the time that you had your prescription filled\nMy life, full length feature presentation\nThere are no intermissions, no time for commercial breaking\nA fighter in his prime, a legend in the making\nThere\u2019s no debating when you let your numbers make the statement\n\n[Hook]"

I ain't even exhausted\nYou can call me sick, you can even call me nauseous\nA sea of great whites, you are a dolphin\nIf I was you, I would be a little more cautious\nI'm way too high for you to look at\nThe future ain't lookin' promising for these rookies\nThis is target practice but I don't even pull the fucking trigger anymore\nCause it's just a waste of bullets\nCome and get these pussies, wipe them off the flo'\nI'm guessing they was hoping for some different results\nI'm guessing they was guessing cause they wasn't really sure\nBut fuck it, I guess I'mma have to let these niggas know\nSo I think it's time for these haters to get off my dick\nGot my own city, you can call it Bobtropolis\nEast side representers reppin' with authority\nAnd I ain't talking congressmen and I ain't talking politics\nLookin' for freaks, freaks lookin' for sausages\nBut we already know that, so that is all to get\nCheck the name tag, you know who the roster is\nATL brand, Hustle H.A.M squad in this bitch\nLike I ain't never had a mic\nFresh to death, I see you in the afterlife\nI eat bars, eat beats for my appetite\nYou wouldn't know about that, you never had a bite\nWhat I gotta do to get some solidarity?\nApparently, I need to speak with some more clarity\nNo luck needed, know no charity\nAnd I'mma grown man, don't need pussy to take care of me\nB to the O, I said it once befo'\nIf I ain't on your channel, go and look for the remote\nAlready graduated, yeah, you see the cap and robe\nBut now you couldn't see me 'less you had a telescope\nI'm Bedrock bumpin', three strikes sumpin\nCall me Jack-o-Lantern, I get head like pumpkins\nIt's nothin', roll up the stuffin'\nPut it in the oven, get baked like muffins\nIf you ain't know, I guess I have to introduce ya\nTo my side of town, somethin' you ain't really used to\nBody blow, uppercut, I do more than bruise ya\nKeep fuckin' with me and you ain't gon' have no future"

Hold up, Bob, don\u2019t go there!\nYou know that they watching, the all-seeing stare\nBut they can\u2019t stop me, I\u2019m already there\nAnd y\u2019all ain't seen shit but y\u2019all already scared\nI\u2019m gone, high like fructose, fructose\nYou wanna know the truth? Really, you don't, you don't\nIt\u2019ll blow you out your mind, like a UFO, UFO\nI\u2019m basically a resident of Pluto, Pluto\nYou know, but you\u2019ll probably be the same one hatin'\nSayin' every rapper is in the freemasons\nWhile the cops giving out free mace to your face\nNow how do that taste? I\u2019m outta my mind\nThese videos tellin\u2019 y'all lies, bruh\nTellin' y'all we holding evil hand-signs, bruh\nLast time I checked I\u2019m from the Eastside, bruh\nSo do your research and make your own mind up\n\u2019Cause us musicians have influence on this mic\nBut they don\u2019t like that, so they conquer and divide\nDouble-H N-D, hip hop never dies\nSo shoot all you want, but we fly\nBecause, you know, no one man should have all that power\nObviously \u2018cause it\u2019s only one power\nBut nevermind, y\u2019all keep worshipping Towers\nWhile the clock keeps handing y'all hours\nBut pucker up because the truth gets sour\nMore sour than the sour diesel I devour\nHear me by the hour, I give you 50 vowels\nWhen I brain storm it's like a shower\nSo pull out your towels, and don't let 'em play you\nDo your own thing, fuck what they do!\nAnd if you good at somethin' make sure they pay you\nAnd if not, take a thankyou\nWhether they praise you, or whether they hate you\nIt\u2019s all about the attention that they pay you\nY\u2019all on that grape drink, try this grape juice\nShouts to Grand Hustle, we got that break through\nAnd, yes, it\u2019s evident we better than\nThe rest of these competitors\nReally there ain't no one else ahead of us\nYeah, I bust these verses off, et cetera, et cetera\n\u2018Cause they watching y\u2019all like the Federers, owww\n\n[Outro]\nKadoish, kadoish, kadoish\nAdonai Tsebayoth\nIt\u2019s B.O.B. and I\u2019m out.

Energy Drink shoulda been my sponsor\nBut sometimes I wonder, what is this race I run for\nI give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic\nThese niggas get mad at me\nTalking all sideways with they eyes glazed\nThey mad cause I\u2019m straight, what the mind sees, the eyes say\nAnd they say that I went pop and the streets say I ain't hip hop\nWell if it's not, then the shit stop"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: B.o.B as an old friend]\nWhat ever happened to Bobby Ray, he used to be here for us\nThen he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust\nWe never hear from you, you\u2019re constantly changing\nAnd your relatives always miss you at family occasions\nAnd your mother misses you too\nSince all the fortune you\u2019ve been too busy recording\nNow she feels unimportant and your daddy\u2019s been going through it\nSince he lost his mother\nThe least you could do is call him and show him, you support him\nI never thought you would sell out\nYou\u2019re becoming so cocky\nI asked you for a picture after your show\nYou walked right by me, I\u2019m like\nAin't this the dude that said that it ain't about the price tag\nNow on your records all that you do is brag\nCome on, Bob, I thought you was better than that, dawg\nWhat happened to Cloud 9 and Generation Lost?\nYou were my idol, just when I thought I'd give up on everything\nI heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\n\n[Hook]\nI heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\n(melody, melody, melody)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B. as a longtime fan]\nWhat ever happened to B.o.B, he once was my favourite\nI swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my playlist\nHe was hood, but so different at the same time\nIt was like a breath of fresh air, everytime he rhymed\nAnd everybody was on him and the world fell in love\nThe girls, the money, the lifestyle, all the above\nI guess he\u2019s stopped giving a fuck for all of his little people\nWith your shades on, we can\u2019t even see you\nIs that what happens, when somebody makes it off of rapping\nThey taste the fame and change like it's just automatic\nWhere\u2019s the integrity? You're on that other shit\nYou don\u2019t even sound the same, I liked your other shit\nBut we\u2019ll still stand beside you, cause somewhere deep inside you\nThere\u2019s more than what meets the eye\nI swear on the Bible you were my idol\nJust when I thought I give up on everything\nI heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B]\nI watched my whole life change in a couple of years\nWho woulda ever thought I would have caught the world by the ears\nI swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured\nBut if it wasn\u2019t meant to be this wouldn\u2019t be my career\nIt\u2019s like, people only see it the way it appears\nBut they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears\nBlood, sweat and tears. We cry blood, all we sweat is tears\nIn the middle of this rap game on the battle field\nAll of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me\nYou never know who\u2019s gonna try to play you and make you look phoney\nI live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies\nWe put it all on the line, we gave up all our belongings for this rap shit\nCause at the end of the day, it ain't just rap shit\nI call it making a way for our survival\nJust when I thought I gave up on everything\nI dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\n\nI dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\n(melody, melody, melody\u2026)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nI dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum"

   "lyrics": "[B.o.B]\nBorn into competition\nWith a feeling that something's missing\nBred in a corn addiction\nWith a synthetic composition\nOn the brink of a civil war\nOr the forming of one religion?\nI wonder what came first\nDinosaurs or Darwinism?\nPledging allegiance to a flag\nSince elementary\nWriting curses in cursive and casting spells\nStung by the spelling bee\nAnd they says congratulations\nYou graduated\nFrom slavery\nTo paid slavery\nYou actually made it!\nHere! Take this gown and cap and wave it\nLike a celebration of going to school just to get a job to pay for it\nLike a nation that traded it's minerals in exchange for paper payment\nHere, these are your gods, you have to praise 'em\nI wonder who we'd worship if we weren't captured and traded\nConsider this my affidavit\nYo, It's the ruling class\nHere to rule yo ass\nPrescription drug thug cocaine mule yo ass\nAgricultural skills sure would suit yo ass\nBut they say, living off the land is a useless path\nHere, work for dead Presidents, HA! fooled yo ass\nAny revolutionaries, they remove yo ass\nFast, click clack, quick blast, in a flash\nWhiplash from the kickback of the impact\nPush yo shit back\nAs long as my head is intact\nI'll be as political as I want\nBecause I get taxed\nNah, this ain't no fuckin diss track, to distract\nOr useless chit chat, or syntax, or\nWho's ass is this fat and who has a six pack\nWho's batting this average, or\nCompare his passes to his passes\nThere's a thousand sports channels\nYou can get this package, or this package\nWho's this savage?\nHey, let's compare your emotional baggage to my emotional baggage\nAnd see who calls each other bitch fastest\nHaters go out they way to fuck up my day\nBut I ain't even worried about your bitch asses\nAnd it's quite the optic, hard to take your eyes off it\nThey make the sky toxic\nPrescribe the antibiotic\nMake a high profit, divide the margin\nYou could die off it\nIf you do, they hide the autopsy\nWhat the fuck are you supposed to do?\nMorgellons in your kosher food\nWhat the fuck is even kosher food?\nThird generation crops won't produce\nBe careful who you keep close to you\nI'm from Atlanta, but shots out to my Oakland crew\nThey say, \"Bobby Ray, the older you is overdue\"\nI say hey, sorry I got a little caught up exposing truths\nI used to think, what would Hova do?\nNow I think, what the fuck would Macho Man and Hulk Hogan do?\nNow, if Steve Austin was America, and the Rock was Afghanistan\nThen Russia and China would be Triple HHH\nAnd the Illuminati would be Vince Macmahon\nNow when the haters are The Undertaker\nThe crowd doesn't stand a chance\nWhen the international bankers are walking through the stands\nSlide yo ass some Xan\nYou think you a fan but you really just a lamb\nNiggas start trends every day but don't never get no pair of Vans\nWhat the fuck is an advance?\nNiggas live on colored people time\nWhat the fuck is in advance?\nTsh, I don't fucking understand\nI just want my fucking bandz\nI'm a walking talking human conundrum\nLike a Muslim going HAM\nLooking for the promised land\nFalse stories of Christopher Columbus\nHolding Pocahontas' hand\nBlack History is the shortest month\nI just hope you understand, when the\nNative Indians don't get shit but\nThanksgiving and some yams, like\nHere, here's a few casinos, huhh, sorry we took all your land, huhh\nWell, let's just move on, because, America's great!\nMan I fucking love it\nDemocratic or Republic\nLightning rod, change the subject\nAll of these religions, I'm glad I found one\nAll of these beliefs and mine's the right one\nTrying to process all this info you hide from\nTill you wake the fuck up out on the advice son\nCulture and religion condition your mind hon'\nWhatever's prohibited, imma defy them\nThe smell of freedom is making my eyes run\nTo authority, i'm the antithesis\nI'm not a pacifist, or a philantropisist\nI don't got all the answersises\nI just got a louder mic, and better stanzasas, bitch\nOh i'm sorry, did I offend you?\nWhat the fuck you think goes on in schools you send your kids to?\nWhat the fuck you think they serve for lunch, what's on the menu?\nThat's why only ratchet shit is what these kids is into\nA language comprehendable\nFriends do what they friends do\nPeople act so fucking hard but really they just gentle\nPsychological children\nGrownups with issues\nGrownups with children\nWho grow up with issues\nCancer tissues\nAbandonment,  misuse\nSubliminal marketing screaming, \"Here, let me fix you\nI have the cure\nI have the remedy\nI am the savior\nI am not the enemy\nBut give me your money, give me your money, give me your money!\"\nEverybody's in debt\nBut this is a free country!\nThey dock your pay, what a mockery\nWhy you on the clock\nHickory, dickory, dockery\nThey want cable, they want coffee, they want comedy\nAnything to take they mind off being property\nTrying to say it properly\nWorking on my tact\nBut I am the anomaly\nThey know i'm the shit like a elio-colonoscopy\nThey know i'm the shit by just looking at my discography\nThey know i've been sent to awake this idiocracy\nMass media, hipocrisy\nTurn you into a worker bee\nHarvest the honey tree\nI'm just being honest, b\nMother Earth quakes underneath\nFather Sky, up above the sea\nGod the father, the sky\nSon of God, the Sun\nAmun Ra, the Eye\nNo more Amen\nNo more folding hands goodbye\nAdios, au revoir, bandz"

Look what happened to the Dixie Chicks\nIt's like nobody else complains\nUntil you try to be more than a nigga with a chain\nCube already told you: \"they corrupted everything\"\nAnd we're just out here trying to function, trying to maintain\n\n[Hook]\nA hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground\nThoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound\nI pray my prayers make it through the clouds\nI pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain\u2019t allowed\nA hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground\nThoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound\nI pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud\nUntil then it's back to the paper route, the paper route\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd of course, it's unfortunate that niggas out here robbing for Jordans\nCan we not afford them, but got enough to get a Glock 40\nIs our views on reality kinda distorted\nBut still, even though I understand the story\nI still fall weak for a booty that's proportionate\nOn the sexy short bitch, so what's the score?\nChilling with some Red dogs, drinking White man's poison\nNow that's a forfeit\nSelling what's for free, that's extortion\nBut still I'm wondering what families were present when history was recorded\n\n[Hook]\nA hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground\nThoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound\nI pray my prayers make it through the clouds\nI pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain\u2019t allowed\nA hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground\nThoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound\nI pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud\nUntil then it's back to the paper route, the paper route\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou think you really know what's going on?\nThey're passing laws where they can run up in your own home\nCameras on your laptop, TV and your iPhone\nThe battery don't come out, that means it's always on\nSmile and say cheese, yeah niggas, gotcha!\nI told you fuckers three years ago about The Watchers\nIf you don't take the microchip, then you can't make no dollars\nThis ain't no lovely day for a neighbour, this ain't no Mr Rodgers\nDon't let them fuckers rob us for our freedom and our rights\nAnd you be like: \"it's on the news so it must be right\"\nWho's pulling the strings? Who's rolling the dice?\nWho's calling the shots and who's starting the fight?\nThink twice...\n\n[Hook]\nA hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground\nThoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound\nI pray my prayers make it through the clouds\nI pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain\u2019t allowed\nA hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground\nThoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound\nI pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud\nUntil then it's back to the paper route, the paper route"

Do you laugh in tune?\"\n\n[Hook: T.I.]"

Kelly, I think I can fly\nBut this is as high as it go\nI can't recall being sober\nCause that was a trillion hours ago\nYou say you want to get higher than me\nWell you got a billion miles to go\nNigga this stone age, roll up and put it in rotation\nMy dro potent and make show faces\nTill I'm po' baby like an old lady\nSo faded like some old navy in an old basement\nWith my OG that's fresh off of probation\nI bang, bang, you be ho saving\nRan in yo ho like home invasion\nWhen I hit up my dealer I'm so impatient\nI be hightailing and ain't no debating\nI know the answer to the whole equation\nAlways baking like a local bakery\nWe pass it around like a roller skating rink\nI go to the club, it stay open late for me\nJust rolled up a blunt and it's motivating me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nWoke up in the morning, grab some weed, a joint and rolled it\nPut some cheese eggs on my stomach, I don't need it bitch I want it\nCrib in California, got a villa in the trump\nI put some converse on my feet and told my bitch, \"let's get this money\"\nOne joint, fourteen grams, that's a half\nBlow torch on the nail, that's a dab\nSpace cakes, Hemp2O, I'm getting blow\nBudder in a G-Pen, man I'm stoned\nOne hit of this wax, got him high, he don't wanna say it\nTry to call my phone, but I'm gone, me and Bobby Ray\nI'm smoking Kush today, tomorrow, I'm a straight shatter\nHardcore budder, lookin' like some cake batter\nIt make me think better, fucking up you're dead wrong\nRasta told me \"fat rips make the dread long\"\nI took a dab, past out fly as hell\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: B.o.B.]\nHigh, in the sky, Superman\nAm I high, yes I am\nI done lost my mind (4x)\nIn the sky, ceiling fan\nPurple haze, Afghanistan\nI done lost my mind (4x)\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSince day one I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt\nBut the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth\nBut the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well\nAnd the waters getting deeper so I must set out to sail\nSomeone called my cell, and left a voicemail\nThey said congratulations on the million record sales\nAs I'm flippin over furniture, knockin' shit off the shelf\nI told myself I'd never get too deep to take a breath but I'm sinkin\n\n[Hook]\nAnd it's so hard to breathe, yeah\nAnd even more so to sleep when no one cares\nIt was all I could need\nBut now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I've seen the valley of the shadow of death\nI've seen the mountains, a wild childhood\nThat's why I sing about it\nI just try to move on and keep my peace about it\nBut come to think about it I can't even count the days\nThat I spent starvin' tryin' to find a some decent housing\nIt's why I'm always smiling but on this beat I seem so violent\nSo ask me about the music scene and what the fuck I think about it\nTime flies I guess that's why I'm buggin\nJust yesterday I was rappin with my brother and my cousin\nIf you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven\nWe knew that we were struggling we just actin like we wasn't\nIt was either make it rapping, if not that then hustling\nSo all I see is magazine covers in this game\nYou either surface or you plummet\nIt's a thin line and I'm just tryin to keep my head above it, damn\n\n[Hook]\nAnd it's so hard to breathe, yeah\nAnd even more so to sleep when no one cares\nIt was all I could need\nBut now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air\n\nAir I (I sink away)\nAir (I sink away)\nAir (As I sink away) I (Damn I sink away)\nDamn air damn pots and pans\nGet carried away damn get carried away it\nWas never in the plans\nBut hey, it's long way from beatin' pots and pans\n\n[Hook]\nAnd it's so hard to breathe, yeah\nAnd even more so to sleep when no one cares\nIt was all I could need\nBut now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air\n\nDamn it was never in the plans\nBut hey, it's a long way from beatin' pots and pans\nBut now I'm sinking so deep I can't come up for air, air, ah"

With\nThese are like modern day villains\nThese are type of people that would kill a whole village\nBuild a fucking building.. And say it's just business\nWho you think gave you religion?\nLand of the free.. Who you think built it?\nAnd don't ever let them tell you nothing different, cuz we know who did it if I ever come up missing\n\n[Hook]\nI'm missing, I'm missing, I'm missing\nTen strands of my DNA is missing\nCuban Linx on my neck as they glisten\nListen up Mutherfucker pay attention\nIt's a New World Order that we live in\nLies on the lips of every politician\nMan at night I pray to God for forgiveness\nI just wonder if the big homie's still listening\nStill listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening\nStill listening, I wonder if the big homie's still listening\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't need a hook but for hooks sake\nIf I had a hook, I'd make the hook say\n\"Be a good slave, be a good slave\"\n(Be a good slave, be a good slave)\nEverybody in my hood brave\nEverybody in my hood slang\nEvery street got a freak\nAnd they give her all the wood that she could take\nI'm fresher than a faema coffee\nGet it? I'm fresher than a FEMA coffin\nI'm willing to die for mine\nBut you the type of nigga\nYou'll call the police department\nIf you can't look in someone's eyes and be yourself\nAnd speak the thoughts that's on your mind\nYou ain't got no reason to live\nYou on the sideline\nYou just a motherfucking slave\nThey got your mind tied up and it's missing\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, I know I appear to be quite severe\nAn unopen mind will consider me weird\nThats just how the Matrix has been engineered\nNow lend me your ear\nLend me your ear\nNot to strike fear\nMore like Paul Revere\nNot talking down on nobody at all\nI just got some shit I think you should hear\nUh, Look\nI ain't acting like I got all these facts and shit\nBut if you calling me a liar, look up in the sky\nLook up in the sky you can see it happening\nUh, I'm not a activist\nJust a young, black nigga with a half a sense\nCause there's ancient knowledge that they hiding from us\nAnd I think it's time that we take it back again\nBecause it's missing\n\n[Outro]\n[First seven lines of Hook repeated]\nLast night I prayed to God for forgiveness\nI know they listening, I know they listening\nI know they got my phone tapped and they listening\nLouis V's on my bag and the feds wanna know what's in the suitcase, Pulp Fiction\nAm I the realest? Am I the realest?\nCause I don't only talk about it and I live it\nBut they don't want anyone to find out the truth\nAnd if I'm right I'ma wind up\u2014"

Could it be Roxxanne?\nNiggas know I'm the bomb, woah, kemosabe\nRacist white people look at me like Bin Laden\nHow many crisis actors out hear rapping today?\nHow many dick appointments can she make in a day?\nYoung guys think they're cold as can be\nBut even triple OGs get old in the knees\nAlways knew niggas was gon' wake up\nAin't shit to worry 'bout if you ain't trying to opress us\nThe whole hotep club, the whole no flex club\nBut if you had the money, buy a Rolex club (hotep hooray)\nGotta be broke,  to be woke, no check club (ho hey)\nNo sex, no neck  (ho, hotep hooray)\nNo neck, no sex, no sex  (ho hey ho)\nHow much clout?

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNot a human, not afraid\nI will not comply, I will not obey\nSee the plan is to depopulate\nBut the body can overcome anything, fuck what a doctor say\nFans shaking me like Bobby wake up\nChip on my shoulder, I was holdin' a grudge\nI wanted to be loved more than I wanted to love\nBut hey, what can I say, fame's a hell of a drug\nBorn a slave to a tyrant\nIt's goin' take more than just petitions and riots\nAre we headed for a future of being indebted to credit\nHopin' the next leader elected will trump the one we beheaded\nWords the wealthiest rappers will never utter\n'Them checks they throwin' to niggas a motherfucker'\nSeems like the future was brighter when I was younger\n(Seems like the future was brighter when I was younger)\nI'm torn between performing and rewriting the norm\nAm I born to transform or just to die and move on\nBe the life that people mourn while reciting all my songs\nTo the battle I am sword dull armor worn\nBeaten down to the pulp for being different\nYou question old tradition they just say you superstitious\nLike a snake that eats its own tail, the economic system\nPublic schools the babysitter, health care is the modern day Adolf Hitler\nFact check, ever since the internet\nMolestation multiplied by a million percent\nYour aunts and uncles, niece and nephews all align with the shit\nHistory shows for speaking up my whole life is at risk\nYeah I'm cocky, kamikaze, who gon' stop me? Annunaki\nIlluminati? Neo-Nazis? They do me how they do Cosby\nWhen you winnin' they gon' love you till you lose like Ronda Rousey\nEvery revolutionary they execute 'em proudly\nIt go JFK, nope, MLK, nope\nSince Lennon got smoked, it's clear they don't want us to have hope\nThey tore down our houses, replaced it with dope\nAnd say that it's our fault, false!\n\n[Chorus]\nYou wanted to fight\nSo you wanna be brave\nSo you found the light and you've seen the truth and you feel betrayed\nWell it comes with cost\nA price too large\nCause if we're really just born to die\nI'd rather never been born at all\n\n[Verse 2]\nStay in school they said, use your tools they said\nBut being on TV looks pretty cool I said\nThat's true I said, must I remind myself\nThese corporations aren't your friends, you should've signed yourself\nThey, they, who are they? They are us\nWe are they, the pyramids started at the top, we just mimic and behave\nThe same way, Babylon brainwaves\nHuman incarceration's the modern day slave trade\nCost of college, cost of living so high you can't maintain\nAll you can do is sell pills, drink tea, and waist train\nStruggle to make mortgage and re-up by payday\nAnd the wealthiest families split it up eight ways\n\n[Chorus]\nYou wanted to fight\nSo you wanna be brave\nSo you found the light and you've seen the truth and you feel betrayed\nWell it comes with cost\nA price too large\nCause if we're really just born to die\nI'd rather never been born at all"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: B.o.B.]\nYou feel that?\nThat's the sound of the kids...\nWith no fucks to give\nWith no luck for shit because they didn't grow up as rich\nThat's the sound\nThat's the sound\nThat's the sound of niggas locked in the pen\nDoing a bid with more time then they should give\nThat's the sound of an oppressed nation\nTired of chasing villains that don't got no faces\nThat's the sound of a nation that don't got no patience for faux proclamations\nWarlocks in churches in sacred locations\nThe sheriff\u2019s a Klansman, the judge is a Mason\nNot to be biased and not what your faith is\nBut how do I trust my own country and state that's more loyal to Satan then their own occupation?\nThe system is rigged, if I vote will I change it?\nGreed will consume us with no moderation\nBlame for a beast I'm not sure I created\nI'm not sure I'm created, like I'm inside a game I'm not sure that I'm playing\nIt's a whole operation\nWhether it's real or whether they staged it\nShit get so tense when I go out to places if I fuck around and sneeze in the air I can break it\nAnd people feel so violated, you feel what I'm feeling before I can say it\nBefore I can step in the studio to lay it\nI know what my role is I know I ain't basic\nBut I guess the truth must hurt, I guess that's why they butthurt\nAll the secrets that I unearthed no stone left unturned\nTo learn to fly you gotta jump first\nI touched the sky that's why I'm sunburnt\nI change a life in only one verse\nWelcome to the seventh pinnacle\nSomewhere between the metaphysical and hella spiritual\nI seen hell and hell is digital as well as visual\nHell is how they did the Aboriginal\nHell is when the innocent get murdered and they don't arrest the criminal\nOh my, oh my god, oh my god, take the steering wheel 'fore I do something that I ain't intend to do, no interviews!\nPacing in my living room!\nB.o.B. what's gotten into you?\nYou wiling you advantage [censored] shit like you are invincible!\nPeople always ask me \"Jeez why you still living dude?\"\nShit I wonder why I'm living too!\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B.]\nWhy I'm living too\nWhy I'm living too\nSay whats wrong with me? Shit whats wrong with you?\n'Cause me I'm feeling good\nMe, I'm in my zone I look up in the sky, and I know this can't be home\nAnd I know I ain't alone\nThey try to take your home\nThey try to sway the weak, and they try to break the strong, huh\nBut I'm not a quitter\nGod's child not God's dinner\nOn God I'm Godzilla\nTry to plot, I'll make the plot thicker, huh\nSee the middle class got a lot slimmer, and the upper class got a lot richer\nThey want a revolt, they want you to riot, they want you to try it\nThey wanna provoke us to keep us divided, but the people are no longer quite\nThey say Bob they gon' to take you out if you keep rhyming this way!\nHuh, I say fuck it we all going to die anyways"

What's your measurements?\nWhat if Donald Trump was really Mexican?\nWhat if a Black Man never was President?\n\n[Hook]\nFlatline\nNavigating the field of landmines\nBlack crime, Black Minds\nThere's no superior bloodline, Yeaup!\n\n[Verse 2]\nFuck award shows, we need justice in the courtroom\nWhen I get to talking real shit, they say \"You bugging dude.\"\nIt's gonna take more than getting some trending on Twitter\nIt's gonna take more than fucking COEXIST bumper stickers!\nThe question, I always hear this question, \"How did you get into the music business, were you let in? Or blessed in?\"\nI'm guessing, I never signed my name in blood or sacrificed my best friend\nI got as far as I could go before I hit a dead end\nSit back and let it set in\nHollywood loves making niggas wear dresses\nThis is where I step in\nAnd I know you don't wanna hear it\nNigga's writing conscious lyrics, just to sell out concert tickets\nNigga's buy or bought a Polo, Polo never sponsor niggas\nTommy never one of the niggas rocking Hilfiger\nNiggas doing charity to be a real nigga, but when the camera's off they don't wanna deal with you\n\n[Interlude: Dr. Sebi & Interviewer ]\nWhen I had cured these people's sickle cell, and lupus, and herpes, and blindness, I was happy! I said \"Now, I can go to all the leaders, I could go to Minister Farrakhan, I could go to Jesse Jackson, I could go to Al Sharpton, I could go to Oprah Winfrey, but what I found out, I was mistaken. I was wrong. They are NOT interested in the healing of any black people\nThat's an explosive claim\nThat is not an explosive statement! That is a reality! There isn't a black leader in America, that is interested in the health of the black race\nYou say that because they refused to interact with you?\nThey are not in the position to respond. If they were, my first case of Aids was cured in 1984. And since then, we've been curing people of lupus and herpes, and cancer and blindness, not ONE black leader ever said: \"Well let us help the brother.\"\n\n[Hook]\nBANDZ!\nFlatline\nFooled us for the last time\nFlatline, Flatline\nThere's no superior bloodline, dead\n\n[Outro]\n(Panting)\n(Beeping)\n(Ding!) Lower Ground Floor\n(Ding!) Ground Floor\n(Footsteps)\n(City Noises)\nPeople asking me, like \"Why Bobby Ray saying all this crazy ass shit? You think he really means it?\" Like this shit ain't crazy, this shit is real, dawg. He's always been rapping real shit\n(Inaudible Voice)\n(Forest Sounds)"

(Preach)\nWakin' up from the lies, I feel betrayed\nI'm guessin' the rabbit hole we dug was actually just a grave\nSkeletons in the closet they fossilized\nNiggas want the truth sugar coated and caramelized\nLife is like a science fiction book where the author dies\nWell I ain't dead yet 'cause the hit ain't been authorized\n\n[Chorus]\nI hear freedom ringin' but I won't answer the phone\nBecause the people on the other end will not leave us alone\nMr. Officer I come in peace just know I brought my piece\nAnd if we can't settle this peacefully the violence will increase, yeah\nI don't condone racial divide I won't be cloned\nI will survive I walk alone look in my eye\nSo give me justice give me peace\nOr give my freedom back at least\nSo we can meet up in the street you decide\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nWho you bow to?\nElected councils, full of scoundrels\nWho now rule the world around you\nWhile wearing house shoes they clown you\nYou wear your house or your whole house full\nRegimes don't die; they change they name and the accounts move\nLife goes on with or without you\nWords fall on deaf ears I think they soundproof\nThe sound of justice makes us cringe\nBut how can we stand the sound?\nYou can't even stand your ground\nA noose around your neck the sharpest minds will cut it down\nCaught inside the web the internet is tightly wound\nEvery day a hundred K? Feel more like a couple thou'\nWhat's a dollar to a pound? What's a pound to the crown?\nLook, ay\nI'm sick of waitin' man this flag I'm sick of wavin'\nNo more participatin', time to form our own nation\nYou call it integration I call that discrimination\nThey say it's risk I'm takin' I call it decision makin'\n\n[Chorus]\nI hear freedom ringin' but I won't answer the phone\nBecause the people on the other end will not leave us alone\nMr. Officer I come in peace just know I brought my piece\nAnd if we can't settle this peacefully the violence will increase, yeah\nI don't condone racial divide I won't be cloned\nI will survive I walk alone look in my eye\nSo give me justice give me peace\nOr give my freedom back at least\nSo we can meet up in the street you decide\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B]\nYou not an activist you're more like a re-activist\nFalse flags, crisis actors trying to re-enact some shit\nStories don't match I never believe half the shit\nWhile they're sneakin' pass a law we're easily distracted, ay\nTryin' to get through to these dense fucks\nYou're too stupid to insult\nI say the shit anybody can prove\nI don't know guess if it rhymes it's gotta be true\nLook, cheap tricks and fabricated speeches\nBlonde hair blue eyes - they even fabricated Jesus\nJust look at the salary paid to teachers\nIt's obvious they don't want us to graduate into leaders\nClearly in court videos don't prove much\nWhy is news cameras in the courtroom huh?\nEven if it's just a game I hear the signal louder\nI think I got the message they don't really care about us\n\nI hear freedom ringin' but I won't answer the phone\nBecause the people on the other end will not leave us alone\nMr. Officer I come in peace just know I brought my piece\nAnd if we can't settle this peacefully the violence will increase, yeah\nI don't condone racial divide I won't be cloned\nI will survive I walk alone look in my eye\nSo give me justice give me peace\nOr give my freedom back at least\nSo we can meet up in the street you decide\n\n[Harmonizing Bridge: J\u00f3ga by Bj\u00f6rk]\n\n[Outro]\nFuck you Farmer Jim!\nYou're all alone out here on the frontier\nNo friends, no family, no cops, no help at all\nThis is the Wild West son, the Wild fucking West\nThere ain't no guards coming out here to save your ass\nIt's just you and me and a murder of crows\nWaiting to pick over our dead bones\nSo you take a breather\nYou let that sink in, don't take too long, yeah?"

I know you heard about that, still a dope boy got birds on deck\nTalking parakeets though, cause you a stool pigeon know you can't wait to run and spread the word bout that\nAnd I never will let 'em, a pussy nigga keep me from being dope boy fresh\nAnd they ain't gon' get it cause it is nigga, you can bet the bank on that\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nI don't do much talking, let the money do it for me\nAnd I don't need no promo, cause the haters do it for me\nI just tell it how it is, while they be telling stories\nWhen you come up from the bottom, that just mean that you was chosen\n(And what it mean when you come up from the bottom?)\nThat just mean that you was chosen\nAnd I don't need no promo, cause the haters do it for me\nI just tell it how it is, while they be telling stories\nWhen you come up from the bottom, that just mean that you was chosen\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI can bet every chain on every verse I ever wrote, on every phrase on every note\nNo wedding ring, but I'm married though to the game for forever more\nYou in the game but you never score, in every lane I'm exceptional\nI'm on a plane where you never go\nAnd they tell me that life is a bitch but I much prefer mary jane as a better ho\nAye, you see most of y'all niggas just fake to me, stories made up like Maybelline\nMy niggas good for life, y'all still trying to get from point A to B\nAnd they say silence is golden, so my wrist be talking shit for me\nAnd haters can't help but hate, shit I can't help but be chosen\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\n\n[Verse 3: Spodee]\nA up on my fitted cap, my momma told me always give the critics (snap)\nBalling with the homies they can try and run up on me\nWe gon' start tripping like they invented maps\nJordan's with denim vests, spending more than your mortgage on Vino Pet\nRoll up the cigars, amino fat\nNot so big, hunnits come out the side\nShe ain't sucking dick, she gotta jump out the ride\nAnother one that's choosing, that's the one I'll oblige\nFocus on the money, only vocal for the moment\nNiggas scavenging the hunger, wondering how I survived\nFor them beat the double but the triple\nBurn em like a griddle, play a sucka' nigga like a fiddle\nI don't say a word if I'm a kill em\nSoon as I get the watch, just put em in the Nets Kerry Kittles\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]"

Although we spent dozens and dozens of years researching and billions and billions of tax payers money researching space and exploring space science, we just saw this planet. We overlooked it. It was hiding behind a blackhole or something, I don't know. But.. but, uhh..  here, he- here are the images\nWhere are the images? You got the images?\n\nSo, here, here are the images clearly as you can see\nIt's about 8 light years away. Uh.. how do we have pictures?\nUh.. We have, we have super fast, we have million mile internet. Faster than anything Earth has seen, but we just use it for to explore space\nUh.. but I tell ya, yanno you can look at these pictures yourself\nWe got all the planets. Uh.. but theres nothing out there\nI mean, HA! I tell ya, there's nothing out there\nYanno we're gonna keep spending money and keep looking\nWe're gonna keep sending cameras into space\nWe're gonna keep sending fucking astronauts into space\nWe're going to keep going out there and keep sending back CGI\nPictures - I mean, cough cough...\nWe're gonna keep sending back pictures\nJust to let you guys know you're alone\nYou're alone\nAnd you're insignificant creatures\nSigning off"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI have two brief questions I'd like to ask, if I may\nWhen you were carrying out that incredible moonwalk\nDid you find that the surface was equally firm anywhere\nOr were there harder and softer spots that you could detect?\nAnd secondly, when you looked up at the sky could you actually See the stars, and the Solar Corona, in spite of the glare?\n\nWe were never able to see stars from the lunar surface\nOr on the daylight side of the moon\nBut I - without looking through the optics, uh\nI don't recall during the period of time that we were\nPhotographing the Solar Corona what stars we could see\n(I don't remember seeing any)\n\n[Hook]\nGiant steps are what you take, walking on the moon\nI hope my legs don't break, walking on\nWalking on the moon\n\n[Verse 1]\nB.o.B, what the hell you doing?\nWhat the fuck does Stanley Kubrick have to do with\nAstronauts and moon men\nWho the hell you fooling?\nFuck you and this whole stupid flat Earth movement\nWell, if you don't like it sue me, even science proves it\nYou're a college student, shouldn't be assuming\nGreen screen, sound stage, sound proofing\nTime to film a movie shoot\nGotta use my tools in the glass case\nAstronaut suit footprint don't match the boot\nBeen to the moon once and ain't been back since\nAnd I'm just trying to figure out where the tax dollars went\nNASA\n\n[Hook]\nGiant steps are what you take, walking on the moon\nI hope my legs don't break, walking on\nWalking on the moon\n\n[Verse 2]\nNot a huge fan of the award for the best rapper\nBut they give the moon man award to the best actor\nGuess we must go straight to the source and let's ask NASA\nUh, how do you explain the occurrence of lunar waves?\nWhy do we only see one half of the lunar face?\nHow do you explain air bubbles you view in space?\nWhy is it so important to lie to the human race?\nMillion mile internet that travels light years\nBut they can't show a space shuttle re-enter the atmosphere, okay\nTo blast off you gotta practice Freemasonry\nAn acronym that stands for Not A Space Agency\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nGiant steps are what you take, walking on the moon\nI hope my legs don't break, walking on\nWalking on the moon\n\nSome may say, I'm wishing my days away, no way\nAnd if it's the price I pay, some say\nTomorrow's another day, you'll stay\nWalking on, walking on the moon"

These girls at my concert, addicted, no double entendre\nWhich is why I'm colder than a tundra on Christmas, put your hands up, can I get a witness?\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nWhy kill? the dark side's where I live\nHorny devils in a red dress and high heels\nYou don't have an idea how many niggas done took my ideas\nI take flight, I'm so bright, I don't even get no light bill\nYou road kill while I'm driving\nI'm high-fiving, my dime riding, My time shining\nFrom at the club and I'm outta town but I'm lying around it\nDeuce chains I'm feng shui, everyday is my birthday\n2 gats at the park, you don't wanna see these guns play\nPatron and lemon lime, I got her back, all in her spine\nI look my wife up in the eyes, and I think about  another dime\nMy atmosphere is ratchet here this right here is Bally gear and\nI keep on killing shit\nAnd I don't even have no tatted tear\nYou can put the motherfucker Caddie here\nYou can put the motherfucker Beemer there\nStill got 2 more garage places, Louies on I unlaced it\nEvery verse I'm going crazy, every girl it's going crazy\n2 guns, 2 chains, 2 rings, 2 bracelets\n\n[Instrumental Solo]"

I ain't sure\nBut for now I'm like Malcolm out the window, it's simple altercation\nGot these motherfuckers blazin'\nAnd I ain't tryna say bye to my kinfolk\nThey choke us out like what they need a noose for?\nGentrify like fuck wherever you go\nPrison walls nowadays big biz\nGive us dope then lock us up to get riches\nThen send us out to a job we can't get\nYou had that nigga flipped now you back in the system\nThat's a cold game, man, aww dog\nIf there's a God pray she listenin'\nThe president don't give a fuck about us\nThe government don't give a fuck either\nThey talkin' make America great again\nI just wanna save my people\nI just want that 40 acres and a mule\nAnother promise didn't fall through\nJust a whole lot of propaganda and lyin' to me and you\nI tried to take the high road\n\n[Chorus]\nI tried to take the high road\nLet bygones be bygones\nI tried to take the high road\nBut now another life's gone\nWhat you expect from me?\nTo turn the other cheek?\nAll you bring is war, asking me for peace\nWhat you expect from me, when all you bring is greed\nAll you bring is war, asking me for peace\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nYeah, yeah"

   "lyrics": "[Part 1: Behind Ya Back]\n\n[Intro]\nYeah\nI'm on some shit, I'm on some shit\nI don't want a bitch that don't wanna bitch (Where is that, bitch?)\nShe been at the gym (Yeah, yeah), eating humus and shit\nShe crushin' on me cause I'm conscious and shit\n\n[Verse 1]\nBitch, it ain't no time so I'm straight for it, throw them clothes down if you want some\nIf you ain't 'bout it then don't come, I know I'm the shit 'cause I'm on one\nFinna nosegrind like a skateboard, that's your bitch? Well, I ain't sure\nYou a square, nigga, there's a name for it, you're a four sided ho shape boy (Square)\nNiggas act like they don't know where I'm coming from\nNiggas act like I'm supposed to stay away from ratchet shit like I ain't from the slums\nNiggas act like they don't see me but they always keep my fuckin' letters on they tongue\nInternet thugs online but they scary: M. Night Shyamalan\nNiggas claim they want my conscious lyrics but ain't appreciate it when they had it\nNiggas act like they gon' hold you down but when you need a favor where they hiding?\nBitches act like they ain't hoeing every time another ho is right beside 'em\nYeah we fucked, so what bitch? Go and tell the whole hood about it\nYou a turkey ass jive bitch, hope you die, bitch, sucking five dicks at a time\nAin't got no type bitch, got a wife bitch and a white bitch, bitch I'm fine\nWhy deez nigga- why deez nigga- why deez niggas lyin'?\nAnd these niggas ain't loyal either, all these niggas droppin' dimes\nBandz\n\n[Chorus]\nY'all niggas gon' find out about me (Bandz)\nIt took a while to get back up on my feet (Bandz)\nAnd everything that I say, is blown out of place\nIf I ain't the shit, why they fly around me?\nI'm on some shit, I'm on some shit\nYou hoes is the feds, I swear I'm convinced\nI hit a club, you know they gon' strip\nI throw all my money like I'm in love with that bitch, I just fuck on that bitch\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook what I gotta do to get respect, that's why I got my boot all in your neck\nThat's why I never ball without the check, often I get so bored I get depressed\nNowadays it's every man for himself, that's why my loyalty is with the set\nI don't know why these niggas fake cool, when they get to actin' I get perplexed\nI'm dishonest man and I must confess, I like nigga shit and I like to flex\nOn my hippie shit, just lost in my head, I forgot that I was still in the flesh\nIt's too late to try to save who I was, I like bitches and I like to get fresh\nHow the fuck did Bobby Ray get corrupt? Bobby Ray discovered Bobby himself\nAnd all they can say is you changed, say that you changed\nAnd all they can do to your fame is say that you lame (Man, that nigga lame)\nRemember me right, remember me right\n'Til the day of my death when I drop in my grave\nBandz\n\n[Chorus]\nY'all niggas gon' find out about me\nIt took a while to get back up on my feet\nAnd everything that I say, is blown out of place\nIf I ain't the shit, why they fly around me?\nI'm on some shit, I'm on some shit\nYou hoes is the feds, I swear I'm convinced\nI hit a club, you know they gon' strip\nI throw all my money like I'm in love with that bitch, I just fuck on that bitch\n\n[Part 2: Purple Mountain]\n\n[Spoken]\nNew music, [mood] music\nBaby-making music, your main lady shaking to it\nThis the feeling teachers never gave to students\nWho get paid too little to raise the stupid\nWho learn more from gangster music than basic schoolin'\nA whole generation of angry youth who get mistaken as a pain or a nuisance\nDistracted by the fame and jewelry, a country where we praise the wicked and shame the clueless\nWhen the enemy is within who do you aim the Nuke at?\nAre we really at the top or is that just how're we are trained to view it?\nI wonder who made the blueprint? Is it the same bloodline that enslaved the Jewish\nBuilt ships and chained us to it, paid a sniper to aim at Luther\nTook the World Trade, flew planes into it, and framed the Muslims?\nThis probably sounds like a scene from your favorite movie\nWell wake up, wake up, it don't take brains to do it, it take bank to do it\nWelcome to the capital where only the greatest do it\nGood intentions is what the road to hell is paved with usually\nAnd bitches swimming bottomless in bottomless ace of spade jacuzzis\nDrowning in my own lust, I had to drain the fluid out the group think think tank\nI outgrew the fishbowl, I snapped your fucking fishing pole\nFuck opinions, they just want me trapped and fucking pigeon-holed\nNow snap a fucking picture hoe\nGot me feelin' like I don't get it, you don't get it\nYeah there's truth but who gon' spit it?\nYeah I could say it but who gon' get it?\nComplicated fuckin' lyrics, who gon' listen?\nWe all fuckin' hated math, now who wants physics\nI ain't speaking to you all cause you all get it\nBut see there's projects from Duval to New York City\nYou ever wonder why it's called the projects?\nPicture the statue of liberty in a thot dress\nI leave you all to your thoughts to process\nSincerely yours truly, God bless"

We'll do it live\nWe'll do it live, fuck it\nDo it live, I'll write it and we'll do it live\nFucking thing sucks\n\n[Intro 2]\nYou and me brother, in his hands\nHe's got you and me sister, in his hands\nHe's got you and me brother, in his hands\nHe's got the whole world in his hands\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nThis world is not what you think it is\nThis world is not what you think it is\nThis world is not what you think it is\nAm I the hand that moves or the fingerprint?\n\n[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nUh, fingertips\nWorld is at my fingertips\nReefer in my cuticles\nPolice want my fingerprints\nCount the fucks I give, on my left hand if I was fingerless\nMiddle finger shit\nTell the hookah girl to bring some tips, uh\nFingerprints identical to a genius's\nBlame my temper, I don't say it unless I mean the shit\nWhat's the difference between the critics and the hypocrites?\nSame difference between Re-blood-licans and Demo-crips\nBandz\n\n[Hook]\nThis world is not what you think it is\nThis world is not what you think it is\nThis world is not what you think it is\nAm I the hand that moves or the fingerprint?\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nWhy the cost of living so overpriced?\nKeep my lawyers on retainer like an overbite\nWhen you the stoner type\nA lot of weed be over-hyped\nHalf a pound or more, a quarter won't suffice\nYou see what my composures like?\nBeen on the road for forty nights\nNever make a hoe your wife\nBut these days hoe is life\nAlways got something in the air like Poltergeist\nThere's your warning activity; paranormal\nI feel it in every corner, aroma of marijuana\nBy now this shit should be legal on every corner\nThat'll happen once they get profits off every grower\nMadness, I see Babylon and it's crashin'\nI'm asking, why this was crafted, who is the admin?\nThe masses, feel like we're captive in this contraption\nI'm spazzin', I'm Captain Stabbin'\nSalute the savage\nBandz\n\n[Bridge]\nYou and me brother, in his hands\nHe's got the whole world in his hands\n\n[Hook]\nThis world is not what you think it is\nThis world is not what you think it is\nThis world is not what you think it is\nAm I the hand that moves or the fingerprint?"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nWell, me and her were the two\nMe and her were together like glue\nBut we lived packed in a shack\nLike the old lady who lived in a shoe\nAnd we ain't really know what to do\nTill one day she got her a job at WaMu\nI said, \"Baby, if you been thinkin\u2019 what I thinkin\u2019\nThen all of our problems are through\"\nSo we got together with the crew\nAnd planned everything with the T\nWe got gloves and guns and bags and masks\nAnd anything we would need\nSo we scoped out the facility\nReally we waited a couple of weeks\nTill it was time to kick in the door\n\"Everyone down it's a robbery\"\n\n[Hook X2]\nYou\u2019re as cold as ice (you\u2019re as cold as ice)\nYou\u2019re willing to sacrifice our love\nAnd now you got me (Froze)\nI said you got me (froze)\nBecause you\u2019re so c-cold\nYou left me cold tonight\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nSo I went to my girl and said \u201cquit playin\u2019 and give me the cash\u201d\nBut nobody suspected a thing\nIt was quite a spectacular act\nSo we get to the safe out of everyones sight\nSo I take off my mask and ask\n\u201cdid your partner remember to cut the line for the panic button in the back?\u201d\nAnd she paused\nThe look she had on her face was cold as ice\nBefore she could she could say the next word I heard the sirens pull out outside\nSo I tried to grab her and run, she pulled away and said she would be fine\nShe was on the clock so I guess nobody would think she was in on the crime\n\n[Hook X2]\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B]\nSo I realized it was over\nWhen the SWAT team kicked in the door\nSo I dropped my gun and the cash, and then I got bummed rushed to the floor\nAnd they took me into the station\nAnd they started the interrogation\nAnd I said, \u201cI ain't sayin\u2019 a word \u2019till I get appropriate representation\u201d\nSo as I get escorted out, to my surprise what do I see\nThats my baby sittin\u2019 in cuffs\nTellin\u2019 the officers everything\nAnd I stand there in amazement\nTrying to find an explanation\nAnd the cops come in and restrain me\nAnd they mace me and the taze me\nI said, \u201cbaby why baby what did I do to forsake you\nHow can you turn your back on me you\u2019re selfish I hate you\nAll I ever wanted to do was love you, were you faking?\u201d\nSo I snatched the gun from my officer\nAnd I cocked it and I aimed it\nAnd said, \u201cthis is for all the pain you done put me through you\u2019re ungrateful how could you\nAll I wanted to do was save you\u201d\nAnd here I am day 55\nWith 55 hundred to go\nWhen you love a girl who is as cold as ice\nEventually you\u2019ll get froze\n\n[Hook X2]\n\n[Bridge]\n32 degrees below zero\nYou\u2019re like 31 flavors you\u2019re oh so cold\nFeels like 30 straight days of falling snow\nI\u2019m so cold and alone, alone\nYou\u2019re like 32 degrees below zero\nOr like 31 flavors you\u2019re oh so cold\nFeels like 30 straight days of falling snow\nI\u2019m so cold and alone, alone\nYou left me cold tonight\n\n[Hook X2]"

Roosevelt]\n\"Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing that we have to fear is... fear itself\"\n\n[Ad-Libs]\nKutt The Check, oh\nKutt The Check, Bobby!\n\n[Verse 1]\nLadies and gentlemen\nGentlemen, consider this moment the Genesis\nThis is the part where you flip the fuck out as you feel the adrenaline\nI'm only here to give, I'm only here to give you the experience\nOh what an experience, they probably should've prescribed me with Ritalin\nBut fuck it, rumor has it A.D.H.D wasn't real, it was just an experiment\nAll of these years I was taught to be ignorant\nTryin' to figure out why I'm so different\nModern day life is set up like a pyramid\nI was sleep, man I woke from the ignorance\nWake up now, tryna' sell me a membership\nShittin' on niggas so much that I'm hemorrhaging\nYour bitch at my concert auditioning\nShe wants me to buy her some booty shots\nBut I can't fix a flat, I'm not Michelin\nMy mind's overflowing with images\nSo many thoughts I can never remember them\nBut I never forget to go straight to the source\nI learned to cut out all the middle men\nI got no patience for your basics\nTime is dwindling, you just ain't interesting\nNo strangers inside of the organization\nThat shit is strictly prohibited\nThe music industry is sickening\nBut no one will ever admit this shit\nThese niggas ain't making the numbers they make\nAnd shit, half of these niggas pretending\n\n[Break]\nYo, fuck a hater, fuck a genre\nNo genre\nYou can't box it in\nThey try to box me in but they couldn't box me in\nThey try to describe me but they just still can't describe me to this day\nYou'll never be able to describe me\nNo genre, no genre, no genre\nThe label\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy do I bother (why do I bother\nSpending time gathering thoughts up to prove I go a little bit harder\nI'm like Jesus on the microphone\nI make vodka from water (shots, shots, shots)\nKinda' like Jimmy Carter, just a little bit darker\nThe rap game just got a little bit smaller\nI just lay down the facts\nSo lay down and stay down or stay off my sack\nNiggas say I ain't dope, need to lay off the crack\nBustin' like a motherfuckin' AR with lasers\nDrop a fuckin' bomb on the radar like Adolf was back\nI blow a state straight off the map\nHundred round ricochet, when them stray rounds come back\nGot to go and get this paper, I can't hang out to chat\nWhere the, where the, where the players at?\nBring the paper back\nRunning through the racks like a motherfuckin' pyromaniac\nI need a lady that ain't a basic rat, with a crazy gat\nWith a decent booty hanging out her back\nGive that thing a smack like a angry black (pow)\nBut before I smash gotta' wear a safety hat\nBobby where the mac? Bobby where the mac?\nMan Eastside got the flow, had to bring it back\nNow motherfuckers acting conscious and shit\nJust cause you're dressed like a hippie\nAttending the Coachella concert and shit\nDon't make you no different than me\nCause I happen to like making money and shit\nI'm just being honest, I never make promises\nI just pay homage and shit\nNo Genre you bitch\nBandz"

We gone\n(B.o.B, give it to 'em, shortie)\n\n[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nGirl, I'm eons and eons beyond these peons\nAnother human like me there will never be one\nThe planet that I'm from, I can't even speak on\nThe stars is what I sleep on\nThe moon I put my feet on\nThe way my aura glow, you'd swear I'm made of neon\nCooler than the freon, that's in your Dodge Neon\nThey say the future is now, to me it hasn't begun\nStay tuned to me and their will never be a re-run\nSo come and leap on my body and as we come\nYou'll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics\nWe gone, we out it, no we don't need rockets\nWe hop up on the mother ship an we gone, we slidin'\nWe slippin' through dimensions, we hyper space glidin'\nBlastin' through the atmosphere\nFrightenin' in the lightenin'\nI know I'm out my mind girl, but you know you like it\nSo hope up on my cosmic highway so can ride it\n\n[Hook: Ricco Barrino]\nShorty are you going, my way?\nCome and ride on my, my cosmic highway\nOoh, let's go\nOoh, let's go\nLook, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more\nAnother galaxy we must go\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nWell, fresh up out the sky I'm like a meteorite\nSo when the studio, no, I don't need to go write\nMan I just came up in the game 'cause y'all just needed more life\nSo, so by the time I'm done their ain't gonna be no more mics\nAnd people ask me, \"B.o.B what kind of language is that?\"\n'Cause I may blast into the future, I may never come back\nAnd I'm a leave with a 30,000 light year leap\nHeaded to a distant planet called B.o.B\nAnd then I'm gone\nMan they not ignoring me\nTaking off from half court Air Jordan\nAll systems go in 10 seconds I'm orbiting\nHanging in the Cosmos like a space ornament\nHeat 'em up like a solar panel, yes I bring the pain\nSimilar to asteroid that's headed to your brain\nMy lane is something that they really cannot explain\nThey try to hold me down but man it's me they can't contain\n\n[Hook: Ricco Barrino]\nShorty are you going, my way?\nCome and ride on my, my cosmic highway\nOoh, let's go\nOoh, let's go\nLook, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more\nAnother galaxy we must go\n\n[Bridge: Ricco Barrino]\nCome and go with me, I'll take you to my galaxy\nI'm talkin' 'bout Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mars, Mars\nAnd I'm sayin' girl, let's ride all night\nAnd I need you for this ship girl to take flight\nLet's go, let's go\nCome on baby let me take it off\nAnother second we gone blast it off\n\n[Hook: Ricco Barrino]\nShorty are you going, my way?\nCome and ride on my, my cosmic highway\nOoh, let's go\nOoh, let's go\nLook, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more\nAnother galaxy we must go"

Why?\"\nNiggas is still (conscious), waiting for politicians to admit that they lied\nSince we all comrades, (let them niggas pre-locked up in them contracts)\nYou accept that its generous, just 'cause the man let his boot off your neck just a little bit\nIf that shit - if that shit - if that shit was threatening, you wouldn't know that it did exist\nThey wouldn't - they wouldn't - they would've hid that shit from you, like all of your history\nThey brought - they brought - they brought Bill Nye back from the dead just to get at me\nThey sent so many agents my way, I could start an agency\n(You are nearly conscious)\nIt's all about branding, all about branding, feel like a fraternity, niggas wanna brand me\nNiggas want Grammys, niggas want families, niggas think I'm crazy, I don't own a damn thing\nWhere the fuck's the manual? They can't understand me, they can't understand me\nAll that shit must go, all that shit is trash, there is not a Plan B\n(You are nearly conscious)\nWhere do all of that go, where we gon' end up, where we all landing?\nThis is just a shit-show, this is just a Citgo, I am only passing\n(You are nearly conscious)\n\n[Chorus]\nI've traveled so far\nCouldn't tell you how far\nFeels as though I have been\nA million places at once\nMany lives I have lived\nMany battles I've fought\nI've fought, and lost\nIf you're looking for trouble\nYou ain't gotta look far\nWithout the presence of dark\nWouldn't be any stars\nYou may know who I am\nBut do you know who you are?\n(You are, you are)\nThese roads, they don't go nowhere\nThese highways are a dead end\nI've had my share of losses\nI've had my share of lessons\nAnd I sure know what hell is\nAnd I ask you this question\nIf we, ourselves, ain't perfect\nThen how could we know what heaven is like?"

What are you doin'?\nYou losin' your core, fan base and your viewers\nLet me show you how to flow, show you how to make music\nObviously you clueless, how I know? 'Cause I'm Jewish\nOh, is that unruly? For me to say so rudely?\nWhat if I stand on trial? What if I stand on jury?\nWhat are we on TV? Who's the judge? Judge Judy?\nWhat am I supposed to return all these cars and jewelry?\nLike I don't even know how the flow supposed to go\nLike I don't even know how the show supposed to flow\nLike I don't even know how the beat supposed to sound\nLike I don't even know where the notes supposed to go\nLike I don't even know how my soul's supposed to feel\nLike I ain't supposed to win, like I ain't supposed to glow\nBut you'll never understand the way that I think\nIf you ain't grow up where they sold dope before\nOh, number one draft pick, number one draft pick\nOh, he's nice for a black guy, oh, he's smart for a rapper\nOh, that's who he's with? Oh, she's cute for a black chick\nOh, he's actually cool, I went to school with him actually\nActually, he could've had a masterpiece\nNow it's just a fuckin' catastrophe\nAnyway, get Fitz on the phone\nTell him send it over to mastering"

I think I think I'm Neo\nI'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload\nAnd if this were a court, then girl I would have to appeal\nI think that the defendant have some things that she must reveal\nHeels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, ma\nGot me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh\nI gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher\nCause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir\nHer thighs go round like roller-coaster motors\nAnd like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over\nHad to connect the headset into her Motorolla\nThis bout to get scary like the end of October\n\n[Hook]\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI got that fire man, and other shit is so so\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI got that fire man, and other shit is so so\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo cold like a hobo wearing no clothes in a snow globe when the temperature is below froze\nI mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league\nMy own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep\nIf I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink\nIf you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink\nI'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see\nI'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be\nI'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me\nBut what's a corner to me, I'm geometry\nSo tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority?\nWhat am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me?\nSaying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie\nMan I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious\nJust like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius\nI'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya\nSo if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang ya'll out like portraits\n\n[Hook]\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI got that fire man, and other shit is so so\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI got that fire man, and other shit is so so\nAnd this is about the time when I hit you with the dope flow\nI'm at the frying pan, your shit is so cold"

All you talk about is whips\"\nI say you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it take a sip\nYeah, everybody got their own two pennies\nBut what does that mean if it don't make sense?\nI see the crowd, their hands up high\nBut what does that mean? What do they get?\nAt the end of the day what I get paid and they go home what do they think?\nHow can we ever be free if policies don't ever change?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude 2]\nYou know, sometimes it feels like it's just against the world, man\nWho really got our best interests, man?\nDon't, don't, don't let 'em take your soul, man\nDon't, don't, don't let 'em take your soul, don't take your soul\n\n[Intro]\n\n[Outro]\nNo Genre\nPeople ask me what No Genre means\nYou know, I once did a mixtape called No Genre\nI didn't realize that no genre man, like no genre really described my career\nPeople started, like, gravitating toward No Genre and, you know, I was like, \"Fuck it, let's do a part two\"\nIt really can't be defined by any genre, so\nFuck it man, No Genre"

(USA)\nAnd I ask you was it an act of valour or a strange reality? (Huh?)\nAnd they make us free thinkers feel like we the radicals (Huh?)\nBut the world is a battlefield\nAnd right now we the Establishment (Woo)\nWhen it comes to war, there's no real parameters\nAmerican pie is the sweet distraction\nFrom what's really happening\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nI can see the vultures, fly over me\nWatchin' me all the time\nWith blood on their wings\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI, see the plan is to eradicate the planet\nAnyone who opposes mysteriously will vanish\nThe travesties are endless, the list is gigantic\nThe stakes have been raised, time to wheel in the cannons, it's propaganda\nAnd all they gotta do is turn on the cameras (Lights, camera, action)\nAnd they'll say anything to make it all look random (make it all look random)\nAs they hide the keys to unlock the answers\nLast time I check the double standard is not a standard at all\nAnd we fall, and we struggle just to get right back up and then fall\nBut we climb, and we crawl, and we fight 'til it's off\nAnd we search through the dark\nTrynna make sense of these laws just to figure out that it's flawed\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nI can see the vultures, fly over me\nWatching me all the time\nWith blood on their wings\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\n\n[Outro: B.o.B]\nWatching over me, over me\nTrying to get a hand and control of me\nControlling me, controlling me"

I guess they on their menstruals\nI don\u2019t need no, come consider the general\nRegardless of my genre, yes, I\u2019m flawless, man, in general\nWhen I\u2019m in the club, girls be jigging on they tippy toes\nSo she take me in like her vitamins and minerals\nYou ain't on my signal, you analog or digital\nGrand Hustle champion, someone turn my anthem on\nWhen my jam come on, God damn I blow straight up\nI am a bomb\nLeaping over barriers like this was a triathlon\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nThings just ain't what I used to know\nThings just ain't what I used to know\n\n[Donnis - Verse 3]\nNow I\u2019m the everyday topic\nUnder a microscope so now I\u2019m feeling microscopic\nMy shit was fading to black, niggas thought I was gothic\nBut made it to the next step like recovering alcoholics\nI bounce back like a Snoop Deville with hydraulics\nAin't \"Nuthin' But A G Thang\", nigga I\u2019m the king of pain\nVeins filled with Novocaine, so I ain't even feeling y\u2019all\nI ain't even hearing y\u2019all, fingernails on a blackboard\nThey say the pen is way mightier than the sword\nSo I\u2019mma spaz out to get inside the mental ward\nThen get my Grammy awards\n'Til your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit\nNiggas got it backwards, let's line up all the factors\nGrew up in the hood, but was raised in the 'burbs\nWhere pops wasn't there so the military made me a man\nAnd they told me to put my dreams in the can\nBut I still made it here, damn!\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nThings just ain't what I used to know\nThings just ain't what I used to know"

Well I need you right here\nYou need to slow it down, cause the streets don\u2019t fight fair\nFor real!\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nBaby, don\u2019t you know\nEverything you do away from home\nCould leave me here alone\nSo baby don\u2019t you go, no\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\n\n[Verse 2: Jake Lambo]\nIt\u2019s easy to get in trouble in the place where I\u2019m from\nNiggas lacking the education but be packing a gun\nI just kick it with the homies and be having some fun\nMama keep calling, I understand you protecting your son\nYou found that I be smoking and I know it makes you mad\nAnd I know you see his trace, scared I'ma be just like my dad\nScared I\u2019m doing something bad, scared I might end up dead\nWell look I chose another path so get those worries out your head\nI'ma keep on doing it how I\u2019m doing it\nStay working hard, making this music and\nShow you I got to get it, I do\nThey asking my motivation and I reply that it\u2019s you mama\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nBaby, don\u2019t you know\nEverything you do away from home\nCould leave me here alone\nSo baby don\u2019t you go, no\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B.]\nA deadly trend that never ends\nCity full of negligence, pregnant pedestrians\nI used to think, 'am I a prisoner or a resident?'\nThey book us for possession but they keep shipping weapons in\nEither the Glock shoots you or a cop do you\nThey set the system up to lock you up a lot sooner\nEverything you try to do they try to out do you\nMy mama said hallelujah cause I got a future\nI got a future after something newer\nThey try to sell you bullshit because it sounds cooler\nAnd if you stand out from the crowd they label you a loser\nDon\u2019t throw your life away, don\u2019t let your eyes fool you\nThat\u2019s how they use you\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nBaby, don\u2019t you know\nEverything you do away from home\nCould leave me here alone\nSo baby don\u2019t you go, no\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo"

Redeem myself for you?\nRedeem myself for your squad? Redeem myself for your crew?\nI'm tradin' blows with a giant, I'm in the ring with a deuce\nI broke myself out the chains, I cut myself out the noose\nSo fuck your slanted review, you write at home in your room\nSo busy spreadin' the hate, you end up missin' the truth\nYou mothafuckas can shove it, I never back down for nothin'\nThe man got his hand up your pants, you just a puppet\nI'm throwin' a fit and fussin' cause niggas killin' their cousin\nMake it worse, he just a kid, kid of your mama's brother\nAsk the world, can I live, live, live? No discussion\n'Fore they put you in the picture, first they gotta check the color\nWhere are your rights that get left in the dust?\nThey get the cheese and don't throw us the crust\nPlus sayin' please doesn't make it a must\nSo we get strapped, give me buck or I bust\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge] x2\nDark skinned nigga, light skinned nigga\nDon't mean shit when the light man hit yah\nI said dark skinned nigga, light skinned nigga\nSee you on the news, hope your white friends miss you\nCause a nigga came up"

How many texts? How many compliments does it take?\nYou know this, you know this world ain't shit, but still, you smile even with a fake grin\nMaybe it's something in your mind you can't shape\nMaybe it's something in your heart they can't break\nNow, look she know how I feel about her, she do what she wanna do\nI know how she feel about me, I move how Mohammed move\nCouldn't leave if I wanted too\nYeah, look\nYou want love? What the fuck is that?\nLove is how you feel, regardless how they treat you back, yeah\nFrequencies above anything negative\nBig up yourself, the same you did the 44th president\nYou can't love the culture and hate the people\nEmbrace the flaws, elevate what you call evil\nNigga, I mastered the shit, I mastered the shit\nLike when Pac shot them cops that was attacking his camp\nWould you let your bitch look through your phone? Alone?\nFuck all that pretentionship, get you a real nigga with no censorship\nTough conversations to have, type of conversations make you pack all of your bags\nWell if it's meant to be, then it'll be\nThe truth will come to the light, eventually\nSo quit up, all that fake shit, quit all that flaw shit, quit all that fluke shit, get off that tough shit, let's have a talk shit\nWe on this art shit, yeah, owning boss shit\nAnd we ain't gotta have a baby\nI like it being me and you\nWhen you weep, you kinda cute\nWhat we watching, season one, season two?\nAnd I don't really want no fairytales\nStill, I wanna fall in love like the fairytale, still\nWe can do this shit without no training wheels, real\nOn some Kemet shit, Heru take the wheel\nThat bitch, my bitch, that's my bitch\nI feel like I got the baddest bitch in Atlanta\nI feel like I got the baddest bitch in the world\nI feel like, I feel like that's my queen, not a girl\nI feel like, I feel like I'm the king of the world\nI feel like, I feel like that's my queen, not a girl\nAnd if you feel like how I feel, then you're lucky as me\nBut what the fuck is luck? This shit was destined to be, yeah\nNow, what is love? Now, what is love? So, what is love? Yeah, yeah\nYou can tug, you can tug, but jealousy ain't love\nJealousy ain't love\nJust 'cause you feeling reckless, don't mean that it's really love\nThe tendency for dysfunction eventually breaks up, it breaks up\nYou can tug, you can tug, jealousy ain't love\nJealousy ain't love\nJust 'cause you feeling reckless don't mean that it's really love\nThe tendency for dysfunction eventually breaks up, it breaks up\nBandz"

What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing? What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing? What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing? What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing?\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn a late night weekend showcase event\nKinda liked you at first but I noticed your friend\nSo I got my folk to approach both of them\nAnd they both came over and poured up some Hen\nAnd we ain't say much but we spoke\nCause you don't have to speak when you know\nTheir eyes said to me \"Systems go\"\nIts about that time we should go\nSo allow me to flow as I propose a toast\nTo the good life, on a good night we go, grab a bottle and go\nTell her hold on, yes a beautiful night, colorful Kodak photo\nBut as soon as you enter the room I guess you froze\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 2]\nIts the end of the week but the first of the month\nWhen the moon gets full but the night is still young\nWith a crowd like this you dont know where you'll end up\nSo I just play it cool like the cubes in my cup\nHuh...but then you came through tryna body me up\nAnd I ain't know what you was thinkin' but your eyes said enough\nAnd everything we felt was obviously lust\nWhich I thought was kinda cool I ain't gonn' bluff\nBut look at the clock its about time that I duck\nOutta the door dont mean to be in a rush but later\nYou can hit me up so you hit me up shoes at the door\nSmoke in the air, temperature's up\nBut I guess when the lights went out it froze you up\n\n[Refrain]"

How many pills do I gotta take to think of a hit?\nTo be at the top, how much cotton do I gotta pick?\nHow many M's do I gotta get? Don't make any sense\nAin't that a bitch? Ain't I, Ain't I legit?\nSince I was a g, fuck with my shit\nI was a stubborn kid, I grew up stuttering, hoping that someone on top would discover me\nHow many publicists do I gotta-?\nHow many publicists I gotta hire to juggle this fuckery? Someone should cover this, I've had enough of this\nI can't make up this shit, I am on too many substances\nHow many streams? How many themes? How many awards? How many rings?\nFuck with these dreams\n\n[Hook]\nWho I ride for?\nDefinitely not no clown-ass niggas, call you sideshows\nAnd we, and we know that your IG be telling lies, hoe\nI'mma reap the shit that I sow\n\n[Verse 2]\nI find it odd, niggas stay saying \"don't wife a thot\"\nBut you wifing thots behind the dignified facade\nYour life's in knots, my life might appear more aligned a notch, but I'm on suicidal watch\n(Hello? you ever just wanna die a lot)\nWell, commence the chords, B.o.B you sound rich and bored\nI say we're just a bunch of piles of shit with pores\nThat spend all day eating, then shit some more\nI don't want kids, I'm convinced, I'm sure\nPull out like my dick's a sword\nEight billion people, 90% of them's poor, but fuck it, what's a few more\nLet's even get more shit to afford\nSeventy summers and you're a cripple corps\nYou on, you on, you on my dick\nA dog, a dog, a dog only holler when it's hit\nThat means something I said must got under your skin\nTell me, how real can I get?\nI said fuck the feds, the twelve, the CIA it ain't shit\n'Cause they can't do shit\n\n[Hook]\nWho I ride for?\nClown-ass niggas, call you sideshows\nYour IG be telling lies, hoe\nI'mma reap the shit that I sow\n\n[Outro]\nIn search of something greater"

We are we homies now?\nLookin' at me like I'm holdin' out\nWhat do I owe you now?\nIt ain't shit  that nobody can tell me\nThey look at my train of thought\nAnd they try to figure a way to derail me\nBut the way that they verbal assaultin'\nAs big as they thought it was not necessarily\nThat's the way it is so apparently\nOne day you're the hero, the next you're the villain\nYour own people ready to bury ya\n\n[Hook]\nYou can break my bones\nBut your heart of stone can't break the seal\nCan't break the seal\nYou can take all I own\nBut you can never take the soul away from me\nAway from me\n\n[Verse 2]\nRest in peace, rest in peace\nTo my pastor, rest in peace\nCan't look back at yesterday\nWhat can they say, what's left to see?\nI flip the style up and became the thing  they said I'd never be\nWhatever obstacle they threw I have surpassed successfully\nAnd you can try to overlook me but I'm too much of a giant\nAnd if I ain't at the top, shit I must be right beside it\nSo don't try to sell me bullshit, I'm too gifted to buy it\nIf I sold common sense, you'd be too stupid to buy it, uhh\nI can't dumb it down, how the fuck I sound?\nTryin' to dumb it down\nYou just thought you knew me 'til you figured out\nWhat I was about\nCause what I was is not the same as now\nI ain't jaded that's just how I view the game and how I play it\nIt's just greed and entertainment\nBut it ain't so entertainin'\nWhen niggas is hungry and you in they city\nYou lookin' like money and fingers is itchin'\nYou won't see it comin' you totally ignorant to it\nNo one in your clique is a shooter\nEvery killer say that he'll do it\nEvery nigga claim that they is the truest\nBut you couldn't prove it until they go through it\nWhen temperatures flare up and niggas get stupid\nThere's no longer hype it's no longer 'bout music\nThere's no more illusion\nNo more confusion\nKnow who you can trust, who you can fuck\nThat bitch that you with, she settin' you up\nBut never forget that karma's a bitch\nWhen she comes around, remember to duck (duck)\n\n[Hook]"

Now can you feel my soul?\nThat's they way that I think with every line\nAnd I'm a be that deep til the day I die\nSo if you feel me now, sing one time\n(Ooooohhhh)\n\n[Verse Two: B.o.B]\nThe doc said I need to take these everday\nBut I'd rather ride around in a chevorlet\nI don't wanna pray, I don't wanna meditate\nI broke up with my girlfriend yesterday\nIf I wanted to, I can do anything\nI could rap a verse, but I think I'd rather sing\nEverything comes around like a boomerang\nBoomerang, rang, boomerang, rang, rang\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro 8X: B.o.B]\nI try to hold on, on to everything\nSweet memories, but that was yesterday\n\n[Break] - repeat 2X over the end of the outro"

So what, we drunk?\nAnd if we run out, it's nothin' to get more\nLivin' my life one day at a time\nTryna get right one play at a time\nYou never can predict what I'm gonna do next, No Genre\nI ain't finna stay off in a line\nIf I had it my way, I'd ball everyday\nHit the mall everyday\nGo through 100K, and put it all in the safe\nWhat the hell are celebrations for?\nDrinkin' moonshine out a mason jar\nPatron margaritas, pretty se\u00f1oritas\nBringing me everything I need like, \"Si Se\u00f1or\"\nYou could pull up to the kick back\nBut you better have a six pack or somethin'\nYou don't wanna be the one empty handed\nWhen everybody ask, \"Where the liq at?\"\nGet right\n\n[Hook: Mike Fresh] x8"

Girl, where your clothes?\"\nBut she ain't say nothing cause she just turned 14\nThe cuts hurt but her pride hurt mostly\nHer mama pick her up and put her shirt on\nNow she headed to the emergency room\nShe asked if dad was coming home from work soon\n\"Please promise me you ain't gon' tell a word to 'im\"\nIt's just another day as the world moves\nMoves, moves, moves, damn\n\n[Hook]\nI look down\nOut my window\nI see your face and your shadow\nOn the street below me\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell in room 34, on the third floor\nThere sits a sad family and they talking to the po\nThe cop ask her if she know if Earl-O sell dope\nThen he get his information then he get back on patrol\nWhen everybody leave, she go and lock the door\nThen she walk up to the window while she standing in her robe\nShe open up the window then she write a little note\nAnd take a deep breath and open it some more\nShe take her first step, her other foot on the floor\nShe hesitate a little but she know she wanna go\nShe look up at the sky then she look down at the road\nAnd sing a little song and this is how it go\n\n[Hook]\nI look down\nOut my window\nI see your face and your shadow\nOn the street below me"

Get it?\nI don't wanna get too specific\nBut you know that I know you gon' miss it\nWhen I'm holding you close and I hit it\nThat's how it's supposed to be, now she buzzin' all over me\nBaby girl I'mma rock the boat, love overboard, love overseas\nAll night long I'm still strong\nI don't know, somethin' must have came over me\nLike a pornstar in a foreign car, we damn near broke 'bout both the seats\nI shift gears, she roll the weed\nIn the trunk, that's where my motor be\nShe upload me pics, no clothing while she network socially\nSee she and I both know he basic\nThis dick got her staring at her phone and she debating, for real\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nShe's a sociallite\nThe social able type\nEven her schedule is sexual, oh what a night\nI'm sayin', \"Oh, what a night, oh what a night\"\nI step into my DJ booth and say hello to the mic\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro] x2\nI'll call, you can't get dick downfall\nI'll make you forget about him"

Uh, real quick, you got a mixtape coming out called Fuck Em We Ball, I'm just curious to know why you ain't put my nigga Droppa on there? Like as if you don't know what he is and what he's about. Man, it took a lot for me to get him not to call you right now. You know, he called me to facilitate the situation so I'm tryin' to but this is tough man. I mean you do, you do a mixtape without the realest dude in the game. Kinda makes me think like, like are you afraid of Droppa's success? Dude, we gotta talk man, like this is crazy and I just hope it ain't that man' cause I would hate for Drop to have to get serious and come looking for you. As somebody who knows him and knows what he's capable of I suggest you take this as a warning dude. You either put Droppa on your side or you go down... just like the rest of 'em. I'm just tryna be your friend man. Bye"

Yeah\n\n[Verse Two: B.o.B]\nI'm that nigga that you heard about through word of mouth\nThey probably say I change the music in the dirty south\nNow that the word is out, the timing is perfect now\nTo take all of these hypocritical rumor and burn em down\nIf you observe the doubt, you'd see what they worried about\nThey say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now\nHonestly, I could give a fuck what you're blurting out\nPoint, blank, I'm in the game rocking my jersey now\nSo just accept me or don't pay me no mind\nEither way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time\nWhether on Greg Street or 107.9\nOr on your favorite rap blog on your rap website\nAnd if that ain't right, then show me straight to the judge\nJust like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs\nVenomous blood in my veins, chemicals up in my brain\nYes I resemble a criminal, B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fucking with mayne\n\n[Break]\n\n[Outro: T.I.] + (B.o.B)\nOkay, you got that (I'm gone, mayne\nI kinda, I kinda feel like I got you, man)\nHehehe (I had to kinda show you up, man\nI ain't really wanna make you look bad, really, honestly)\nAy, man, aye man that laughing, that laugh is natural\nBecause I'm literally amused by your sentiment\nI mean if you really feel that, know what I'm sayin\nThat the likes of the second verse can even\nSlightly compare with the immaculate (Hahaha)\nThen I must take a chuckle...Hahaha\nYou know what I'm saying, but never no mind\n(We can have em blog about it)\nAbsolutely, man, I'll let you guys be the judge\n(You know you gonna do it anyway, fuck it)\nB.o.B or T.I.P. Know what I'm saying, you be the judge, dog\n(Which could be the better acronym for the song)\nBut you know what either way it's Grand Hustle!\nHahahaha (Ah-haha)\n\n[Chorus until fade]"

   "lyrics": "[Hook]\nWhen I wake up from a full night of sleep\nI put my best foot forward indeed\nAnd as the colors begin to sing\nThey seem to say to me, \"come on\"\nCome on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on\nCome on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on\nCome on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on\nCome on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on\n\n[Verse 1]\nEver since I first arrived here\nI've been on the run like an eye tear\nAnd it took me a while to get my life steered\nBut now I'm in the moment, while I reside here\nYup, that's why I coordinate with my gear\nSo you can feel the feng shui as soon as I'm near\nYeah, and people have the nerve to say that I'm weird\nBut you just in a box, so get your mind cleared\nYeah, yeah, that good music, man, we got it here\nSo we can get the vibe high like a light gear\nOr maybe, fly high like five deer\nCall me Santa Claus, when I come through I gotta put 'em on\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, ever since I was eleven\nI have found heaven in my self expression\nHuh, no, my childhood I never left it\nYes, I'm still a big kid though I never stress it\nYet, memory is evanescent\nSo I make moves with a special method\nThat allow my dreams to be manifested\nSo you're past the promised land, no, I can't accept it\nThis life I lead is a very blessed one\nSo, that's why fans have many questions\nYet, I still leave many guessing\nI'm an artist, so I gotta have a bad collection\nI put 'em on (I put 'em on)\n\n[Hook x2]"

Her? Or is it somethin super?\nSilly me still in love with a cougar!\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Asher Roth:]\nMy aura takes the form of the aurora borealis\nOr a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad\nThe neural path I've traveled has immediate reaction\nCan't you see that I am beaming? I'll be leaving in a second\nSipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions\nAt last, I can relax, looking past all of the action\nA fraction or a fragment of me actually is present\nThe rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house's zenith\nYes, the fence intimidates, it's meant to keep you out (But)\nLet your senses resonate and leap it in a bound ('Cause)\nFreedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown\nAnd even the voice of reason couldn't speak it out loud (But)\nMortals are immortal when their soul has been imported\nTo a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole)\nThis is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic\nAs he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow\n[Charles Hamilton:]\nRey Mysterio flow, stayin' clear\nOf makeup-smeared hatin' queers, makin' clear this is spiritual\nThough a spirit you owe, church final\nYour funeral in an arena, you searchin' for fire\nOr titles, or tidal waves\nTie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98\nTo throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!) (Beam!)\nBoa constrictor, chokin' (Niggas!), the grown man (Beam!)\nPawns mean, your controllers get broken (Nigga!) (Beam!)\nAnarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (Nigga!) (Beam!)\nLove, I get none, like sayin' no to niggas\nHamiltonian's loneliness, so I hold my (Beams!) (Niggas!)\nI logged on to see a c-section, a gross display\nSleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won't go away\nI keep pressin' like my phone is afraid\nTo be the star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say\n[Lupe Fiasco:]\nCalling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together\nFire like the fire flower, flyer than the super feather\nSuperman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap\nYou can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme\nYou can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris\nFoolishness, Lu been doin' this since super letters\nSo I can't spell and can't mail it out\nIf you can't feel, it's too full, you can't peel it out\nShowboatin' at the show, but you can't sell it out\nI'm on the sea shepherd deck, helpin' the whales out\nAll my egos in the mirror, checkin' themselves out\nThe speakers on bump, the rappers on acne\nThis track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes\nYes, sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up\nAnd went and took all the bitches of the athletes\n[Mikey Rocks:]\nBig up to what's been up, nigga\nPin-ups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good\nAnd the kids connected up, and they clicked snap\nHollerin', \"Yeah, we weighed on the iPhone scale app!\"\nWithout fail, the best to ever do it just will\nHaven't done it all, but we got copy wheelwell, though\nBut it ain't no sweat, I got a whole outfit\nAnd a new fitted cap that I ain't wore out yet\n(Check, check, check) And I'm beamin'\nYeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith\nProjected widescreen, now they got it 3D\nNow we NBA'd up from development leagues\n[Chuck Inglish:]\nAy, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell\nMan, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail\nBubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window\nOf whatever 'Lac truck pick her up, retail\nNigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi\nOn my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby\nGrab my coattails and get a grip (Grab 'em)\nYou want the truth? Well, the truth is\nThis is it, pointin' out the differences\nThis is exquisite shit, riveting, isn't it?\nLizard king loafers on swole when I'm kickin' it\nJoe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole\nYou a handshake away, and them fingers is cold\n[Blu:]\nTouch art, lush heart, brush my niggas' shoulder off\nNow that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y'all's\nMaybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all\nRoger that, scholars back, solid black, go God\nGobble Gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw\nPompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on\nSo gone, strode strong through your lawn 'til the dawn\nTell you mom, name another real as John, kill a song\n'Cause when you feel it, and it make yo' ass chill and calm\nPayin' more than just attention for that glass I'm sippin' on\nDog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad\nKiddin', ma? Scratch backs, bringin' out them kitten paws\nAnd pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen's warm\nBack to attendin' business, do not lay them digits wrong\nDippin' all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John\nThis is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period\n[Diggy Simmons:]\nI know what you're thinkin', thinkin' I do not belong\nTell me Diggy ain't beamin', 'course I should be on this song\nYeah, I'm a child of God, my reflection is on\nYeah, I'm only 15 and, but my sixteens is strong\nDidn't want me to shine, now we sharin' the stage\nTwice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age\nSo the remains, and it ain't even how\nThat Verizon flow, are you hearin' me now?\nWord to Wasalu, they was sayin' my future was dark\nI had the fame, but my name was missin' the art\nSo I'm drawin' the line, and I'm crossin' the Ts\nAnd I'm dottin' my Is, barely catchin' my Zs\nBut I'll be good by the mornin', on my global grind like JoJo\nThey be lookin' at what I'm puttin' on and, so fly, so fresh at the SoHo\nMost niggas don't know though, they can catch me on the first flight\nBeen workin' on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe\nBut I did it for the love, no check, mate\n[Dosage:]\nWhen people said I couldn't, I wouldn't, I made 'em believers\nI come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers\nFrom the City of Brotherly Love, they sayin' we need you\nTo be the voice of the people and go against all this evil\nSome people hate it, but I made it, so I'm never concerned\nAbout what they be talkin' about, I've lived and I've learned\nWith my dream and my drive, I determined my turn\nIn this business, because I'm in control, meetin' adjourned\nI said, \"It's Third Degree, y'all heard of we?\nI'm Dosage, have you heard of me?\"\nI come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be\nWhere people say it doesn't matter to be much\nI was on the Steppin' Lasers tour, and man, I shooked it up\nThat was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up\nIf you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!)\nRight before your eyes, forget about the dividends\nI just want to say I remember when\n[B.o.B:]\nWell, it's B to the O, O to the B\nYou know it's the flow, you know that it's me, I flow to this beat\nAs easy as goin' to the store and holdin' receipts\nAnd foldin' 'em neat, I'm focused as focused can be\nYou know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace\nOr things could get heated and you'll get ferociously beat\nSpeakin' of ferociously beat, you know that girl 'Nique?\nYou know she's a freak, but anyway, back to what I'm supposed to be\nSayin' all over this beat, you know that we Gs\nYou see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings\nEverywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah\nAnd you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam\nIt's the All City varsity, hard-headed squad\nWe played y'all spades, y'all handle y'all cards\nBut we ain't all odds, we just blaze, man\nY'all playin' checkers in this game, this is chess, y'all pawns"

Terry Urban..)\nThis motherfucker on?\n\n[Verse 1]\nOkay, I think I wanna tell ya'll a little story..\nAbout a young boy, a very young boy\nAlways playing games, but he never had a toy\nMaking A's in school? (Psh) He couldn't do it\nA crazy motherfucker, yes, everybody knew it\nLong story short, that nigga was me\nThat nigga is B., destined to be\nA failure, but I still made it out - hell yeah!\nI was stubborn, couldn't nobody tell me nothing\nWalk around smokin' like I live in Amsterdam\nMiddle finger to the sky, like I don't give a god damn\nBut rebellion is just a side effect\nHomicidal? Maybe, Suicidal? Yes\n\n[Interlude]\nBoy, I tell you, niggas be like:\n[\"Niggas\":] \"Why in the hell you so quiet, nigga, you sick?\"\n[B.o.B:] \"Haha, hell yeah I'm sick nigga look at me, you can't tell? What you think going on with my head? I don't even know, I need God to tell me.\"\nBut anyway, let's get back to the story, enough of this shit talking now\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy daddy from the Barn, and my momma from the gutter\nSo I guess that makes me a country motherfucker\nAnyway, in school, your boy was a huslter\nI had everything on deck to get that butter\nBut I was headed down the wrong path - smoking weed, selling weed, failing out of class\nBut I was like, \"Fuck what the 'Po think, I'm a let the [?] stain\"\nBut I ain't fuck with crack, ya'll can have that\nBut on top of that, I thought I got a bitch pregnant\nFor 7 damn months I thought she was expecting\nThen I found out it wasn't mine, but that was only half the issues that was off my mind\n\n[Interlude]\nAnd then, my parents was telling me \"You need to go to college, and you need to do this..\"\nAnd I was like, \"No sir. I'm straight on it.\"\nI ain't trying to spend 40 thousand, just to be 50 thousand in debt when I graduate\nAnd a scholarship? What the fuck is a scholarship?\nMy G.P.A started with a damn decimal, you know what I'm saying?\nBut anyways, let's go\n\n[Verse 3]\nBack to the saga, I'm dealing with these problems\nI'm back to graduating, I ain't finna to go to college\nSo I gotta figure out how I'm gonna make some dollars\nBut I ain't in the streets, so I gotta slang beats\nThen I sold my first beat, got a couple stacks\nAnd just like a nigga, I spent it like that\nGot a couple diamonds, got a couple hats\nAnd filled up my closet with some shoes and some slacks\nNow I'm back to square one, where I'm at now\nRapping in this booth, in this basement of a house\nBeing honest man, I'm just trying to make it out\nBut fuck it man, I'm out\n\n[Outro]\nYeah.. And that's this typical story of a young black male, living in Decatur, off Cantler Road\nBut you know what, though? This just ain't your typical story, you know what I'm saying?\nBut y'all watch out though, y'all gon' see.. Aha!\nI ain't really got shit else to say, I just want to hear myself talk\nAnd I know y'all want to hear me talk, cause y'all still listening\nMy voice sound sexy, don't it? Aha! I'm just fucking with y'all, I'm"

Me I'm doing what I always do\nGrinding, if you wasn't steady hating you'd be balling too\nI know you seen us falling through\nAll the rich niggas is on my crew\nFuck it, they can't touch us, if stuck up is what you call it cool\nOh!\nYou should of seen when I came down in that\nBlack on black, custom gator, haters face down on the mat\nSplat!\nYeah I can make a green nigga mad\nQuick, fast, flash like ten cash on his bitch ass\n[B.o.B]\nYou can tell I'm a G by the walk and the stance\nHow I play the game make them talk in the stands\nWatch how you talk when you talk to the man\nIf it ain't about bread you can talk to the hand\nI, I, show you how to get rich\nYou got a weak arm I'll show you how to pitch\nMade it so play I'll show you how to hit\nAnd tell the police I don't know about shit\nAye guy, I'm fly, something like the air\nAin't that something?\nWhen it's stunting man there's nothing like air\nHomie hold it right there, homeboy hold it down\nSpent five at the mall and had the haters going down\n\n[Chorus]"

Open yo' eyes - you see the cherry Mase' right?\nYou see the streets, rollin with me, cause my notary certified\nYou a hundred deep, but they be respectin me when it's only I\nGreen pie, back it up, tell Matty pass the mic\nKnow what I'm sayin I'm nasty right, my lyrics got me creamin dykes\nI'm by myself when takin flight, and fuckin them girls that keep it tight\nRedbox, is the movement, Tim, where's they (Home Improvement)?\nWhile you rappers keep on tryin, I'm #1 already proven\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Mac Boney]\nWhat is the numero uno?\nI dip and I slide in my two-do'\nDeez niggas be watchin while bitches be jockin\nBut Boney jack keep it so cool doe\nI'm seein 'em checkin my moves out\nBe careful while keepin my tool down\nThey know that I'm reppin that A-Town\nSo why do these fuck niggas play 'round?\nI guess you can hate now - we straight\nWe got cake, we got bread, we got made clown\nWhile you broke niggas stayed down\nI stayed up on my game and my business I'm paid now\nI'm never gon' lay down\nWe (Grand) and we (Royal) y'all niggas just stand down\nFor yo' homey be man down, we done ran down\nTyler bent on his ass now\nI'm the head of my class now\nSo I'm never gon' bet for these boys that stick hands out\nI prefer to keep hands down\nSo I know who you are when I'm throwin my fans out\nWhy swing on my Denzel?\nI've been ridin and swervin these niggas since oh-fo'\nBut in one-oh, I drop one mo'\nSo these niggas'll know I'm the one ho!\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAbout four years ago while I was on the grind\nEverybody was telling me I was just wasting my time\nBut then about two weeks ago my n**ga I got signed\nSo I had to leave Columbia without saying goodbye\nAnd now I'm finishing my album up while at the same time catching up on algebra\nEverybody where's Bobby ???\nBut I ain't round now, I'm in California\nBut I still rep the ?? where it's greater\nBorn in North Carolina, raised up like a razor\nSharp enough to turn some player haters to a plate of taters\nI ain't fucking with y'all, I'm trying to fuck in my Mercedes\nBenz, blowing on they grinch, I'm gone in the wind\nEverybody popping up, they trying to be my friend\nPlaying that pretend, so I just pretend\nThat I don't even seem em', so to me they don't exist\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeace\nBut no, I ain't gone Hollywood\nI'm still in the hood and I blow a lot of good\nAnd when I'm out I don't roll without my buds\nMy buddy and my slut and the best, best buds\nGotta get a ??? just to roll it up\nSo If you in the need baby come on take a puff\nCome and stay with us if you wanna make a fuss\nIn the middle of the night tell ya boyfriend hush (DAMN)\nBut no don't take it personal\nYou so bad when you move with earth my soul\nAnd this nigga wanna hop and just ???\nBut be careful, this thing it'll hurt you fool\nOh yes yes I'm a beast and now I hunt ya sleep to put it honestly\nI'm like a monster at lunching season (HEY)\nAnd the game is my prey and I'm munching people\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm going 20 times gold out the gate\nCause the game is a hoe and I'm holding her waist\nI'm holding her tight so she know when to sway\nWhen I'm holding a mic they won't know what to say\nI got what you need like a bowl of chilly\nAnd my flows stone cold like I froze it in a tray\nIn the middle of the ocean, I'm floating away\nThat's why they call me B.O.B\nI ain't really in this for the Benjamins and dough\nI'm just trying to get me a percentage of the globe\nAnd when I'm done with it, man I'm finished, I'ma ghost\nI'm just trying to put the truth in your earlobes\nSo be easy, but the bitterness away\nCause I'm critically acclaimed and I'm clinically insane\nI'm finna get up in it, I ain't finna hesitate\nLike a n**ga on the building finna take his life away\n\n[Verse 4]\nBut I don't want to die, I just want to ride\nOff a ???, that's where I reside\nThis is where the struggle is and this is why we strive to breathe\nPinching pennies to make ends meet day and night\nEven though this ain't no paradise, n**gas carry knives or a pair of nines to make sure they still survive\nWe just trying to make it out to see a better life\nBut they call us thugs cause' the sun never ever shines\nSo if you know what I'm talking about and you really feel me\nWe puffin killa killas, so we got us feeling silly\nThat's why I'm repping for my town and my city\nCause when you from the hood they treat you like you no good\n\n[Verse 5]\nThat's why I got all the brother calling me\nI spit that real shit, and yes it's quality\nIf you don't like it dawg, my apologies\nBut nobody saying nothing back when I ain't had nothing\nNow ever single body trying to get up on my\nBut I tell em get to stepping while I'm stepping\nI was broke but now I'm kind of riding like a\nCause the east side in Dakota's where I'm repping\nYeah, I got the crack you scratch and sniff and then you get addicted\nI got that shit, It'll have you sick, and no you can not fix it\nI'm about to drop some classic hits so I'ma snatch the hitlist\nSo put your aprons on cause it's hazardous to listen\n\n[Verse 6]\nI ain't really into making baller music\nCause I was never balling"

Uhh, they can have it\nBut see, I just got drunk and took a stab at it\nSee, everybody's awkward while I'm singin this\nBut, the truth is, everybody's thinkin this (damn right)\nAnd if this song ever leaks on the internet\nThey'll be like, \"Bob's actin real niggerish!\" (Nigga!)\n\n[Outro]\nAh ha! Ay man, you you really shouldn'ta done this song dawg\nYou shoulda done left that shit alone\nBlack people don't like when you be talkin 'bout nigga dawg\nYou need to just quit sayin that shit\nBecause if we quit sayin that shit, then, then\nAll black people will uh uh unite and get better\nYeah that what we need to do, we need to ban the N word\nAnd when we ban the N word, everything gon' get better\nY'knahmsayin? So like you need to quit talkin 'bout that shit man\nIt really ain't cool\nEverybody's really just lookin at you like a asshole\nY'knahmsayin?

Man come on, man.. Quit being a wuss\"\n[Heckler:] \"LOSER!\"\n[Person 2:] \"I don't know!\"\n[Person 1:] \"Have some balls..\"\n[Heckler:] \"BOO!\"\n[Person 2:] \"Agh..\"\n[Person 1:] \"Don't be scared!\"\n\n[Hook]\nDon't be afraid! No, don't be afraid!\nJust knock on the door! Just knock on the door!\nDon't be afraid! No, don't be afraid!\nJust knock on the door! Knock, knock on the door!\nDon't be afraid! No, don't be afraid!\nJust knock on the door! Just knock on the door!\nPromise wit! This is your life! Go on and fight! Go on and fight!\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, let me tell you about the story of a brother named Horris\nHe got a dope beat, but can't come up with the chorus\nHis label's on his back, trying to make him a hit\nBecause he got eighty songs, but they don't make sense\nBut, this is his job and he gotta get paid\nSo what else to talk about, besides slanging cocaine?\nAnd why not? He ain't got much to say\n'Cause if he talk about some melty, he'll feel gay\nHis [?] he gotta fix his appearance\nSo he go out and get some jewelry and expenses\nSo when he's on stage and he got a good image\nBut ain't nobody moving cause don't nobody feel him\n'Cause it's the same song with the same old flow\nAnd don't nobody believe him, he can tell he know\n'Cause when his album, ain't no one at the store\nThen the sales go down, and the truth gon' show\n\n[Hook]"

Can you turn that down? \"\nCause they say I got too many 15's in my ride\nAnd the Alpine is vibratin' they booty, chest and thighs\nSo girls be gettin' juicy wet when they get inside\n\n[Hook]"

You'll never know that no matter what song\nWhat the concept is or whatever, I'm tryin to keep it 100\nSo I may not be givin you the story but the story got the truth in it\nYou feel me? (\"SCREAM!!\")\n\n[B.o.B]\nOh yeah, believe it, I can tell many secrets\nBut the mo' I talk about them that's just the mo' that you see 'em\nYup - I'm a believer, not sayin I'm religious\nBut I see somethin wrong with how we livin in my city\nWhy everybody from Decatur wanna be a sanger?\nOr be an entertainer, or to be rich and famous?\nYou see us on TV, you sit for hours and you stare\nNot sayin that we Gods, but that's what they try to make us\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Interlude]\nAnd like I said - even though I'm tryin to get to paid\nI ain't fin' to do what they want me to do dawg\nRealer than that I'm from Decatur\nDecatur's a city that's gon' be on yo' mind soon as you think about it\n\n[B.o.B]\nHell yeah I'm from the Eastside\nAin't sayin it just to get the streets behind me\nAin't like slum, but I know where I'm from\nSo I spit it for the slums and the street society\nIt's yo' block that I'm beatin' down\nSo that real shit's what I'm speakin 'bout\nNow I can probably, tell you a lie\nTo tell the stories about people's problems\nBut everything that I got to say is\nContagious like toxic waste\nDon't play ball but I'm Atlanta's Bravest\nSo if I'm fake then it's not today\nNow I can sit up here and lie up in my rhyme\nAnd tell you everything is fine but y'all ain't blind - nah~!\n\n[Chorus]"

Who's sealin who's fate?\nDifference between the losers and all the greats\nWho's real and who's fake? Who's sealin who's fate?\n\nIt's bed time (bed time) tuck yourself in\nI can tell that you're terrified (terrified)\nCheck my rep and you'll see that it's verified... {*fades*}\n\nPepsi Max\nZero calories, maximum Pepsi taste"

The stocks went up so pardon the fee\nDont get it twisted, how can I change?\nIm still the same nigga, just harder to reach\nIm self-made and Im certified, flexed up like Im working out\nI spit flames its Kirby time Im so fly I might burn alive\nIn her hair like curling iron, she grip that wood like turpentine\nI asked her what that mouth do then she verbalized\n\n[Hook]\nThey came to doubt us with my mess, and you the fool\nYou tryina post a VIP my nigga, who was you\nValet my shit, I rock that shit, I rock that fucking spot\nSee these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot\nIm flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing\nSee these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot\nIm flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing\nSee these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot"

I know what I gotta do\nWhen you travel on this road, man after a while\nNobody\u2019s on the either sides of you!\nReaching out to other artist for a wider view\nIn reality artists just don\u2019t have the time for you\nIt is what it is, I don\u2019t take it personal\nBut it\u2019s a jungle out, lions don\u2019t eat vegetables\nI mean veggies I\u2019m all about my...\nI don\u2019t smoke .. and I\u2019m never on a...\nI\u2019m going full speed, but I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m heading\nSo keep up my yard and never touch my...\nI\u2019m on the edge, you should never cross the line\nNiggers feel safe when they\u2019re online...\nI\u2019m about to show what a hell is...\nSo let me do this for East Side bitch ... on six!\nCall it what you want, but real recognize real\nSo the ... true niggers don\u2019t even exist!\nAh, grand hustle, it\u2019s B.o.B\nIt\u2019s free.. not a lot of niggers bet\nSo now we gonna see what\u2019s up and what\u2019s good\nBobby Ray coming to your neighborhood!\nYeah that\u2019s what\u2019s up, good news\n\nThanks to madailui"

Yeah\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI'm that nigga that you heard about by word of mouth\nThey probably say I change the music in the dirty south\nNow that the word is out, the timing is perfect now\nTo take all of these hypocritical rumor and burn em down\nIf you observe the doubt, you'd see what they worried about\nThey say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now\nHonestly, I could give a fuck what you're blurting out\nPoint, blank, I'm in the game rocking my jersey now\nSo jazz it to me or pay me no mind\nEither way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time\nWhether on Greg Street or 107.9\nOr on your favorite rap blog on your favorite rap website\nAnd if that ain't right show me straight to the judge\nJust like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs\nVenemous blood in my veins, chemicals up in my brain\nYes I resemeble a criminal, B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fucking with mayn\n\n[Break]\n\n[Outro: T.I.

These girls at my concert, addicted, no double entendre\nWhich is why I'm colder than a tundra on Christmas, put your hands up, can I get a witness?\nWhile I kill the dark side's where I live\nHorny devils and a red dress and high heels\nYou don't have an idea how many niggas done took my ideas\nI take flight, I'm so bright, I don't even get no light bia\nYou road kill while I'm driving\nI'm high fiving, my dime riding, My time shining\nFrom at the club and I'm outta town but I'm lying around it\nDeuce chains I'm fung shway, everyday is my birthday\n2 gats at the park, you don't wanna see these guns play\nPatron and lemon lime, I got her back, all in her spine\nI look my wife up in the eyes, and I think about a another dime\nMy atmosphere is fractured here this right here is bally gear and I keep on killing shit\nAnd I don't even have no tatted tear\nYou can put the motherfucker caddie here\nYou can put the motherfucker beemer there\nStill got 2 more garage places, louies on I unlaced it\nEvery verse I'm going crazy, every girl it's going crazy\n2 guns, 2 chains, 2 rings, 2 bracelets"

Nobody does\nCan I have swag without being stopped for it?\nI board 1st class, ye ain't even lookin at my boarding pass\nTil ya find out who I was\nNow you want a photograph, a photograph\nHaters on my back, like some shoulder pads\nNigga finna snap like a quarterback\nYea they know I'm fly but they hope I crash, hope I crash\n\n[Ponte]\nIf anybody else got something to say\nGet in line, motherf*cka\nI swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind\nDon't know why, I guess it's\nCuz I'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nI'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nFly muthaf*cka, Fly muthaf*cka\nI swear I'm always on a hater's mind\nDon't know why, I guess it's\nCuz I'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nI'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nFly muthaf*cka\nOkay now watch me fly, muthaf*cka\nI swear I'm always on a hater's mind\nDon't know why, I guess it's\nCuz I'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nI'm a Fly muthaf*cka\n\n[Verso 2]\nFly, fly, that nigga so fly\nY'all niggas so weak\nY'all niggas just blah\nThey don't understand\nCuz you're just so blind\nI do this for the days\nWhen I had just enough to get by\nNow I got more than enough to get by\nBut I got more than enough on my mind\nJust lost a loved one the other night\nJust got home and another one died\nI don't even have the tears to cry\nTryna find gold in a diamond mine\nCuz diamonds are harder and harder to find\nAin't no one left for me to call\nAin't no more numbers on my line\nTell me how high must I climb\nYou fuck niggas stay on line\nBut I don't really have the time\nI don't really have the time\n\n[Ponte]\nIf anybody else got something to say\nGet in line, motherf*cka\nI swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind\nDon't know why, I guess it's\nCuz I'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nI'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nFly muthaf*cka, Fly muthaf*cka\nI swear I'm always on a hater's mind\nDon't know why, I guess it's\nCuz I'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nI'm a Fly muthaf*cka\n\nIf anybody else got something to say\nGet in line, motherf*cker\nI swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind\nDon't know why, I guess it's\nCuz I'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nI'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nFly muthaf*cka\nOkay now watch me fly, muthaf*cka\nI swear I'm always on a hater's mind\nDon't know why, I guess it's\nCuz I'm a Fly muthaf*cka\nI'm a Fly muthaf*cka"

In my past it ain't matter then\nWell, it comes with the territory\nMy life is not an ordinary story\nNaw, and I ain't talking big\nThis is just how I feel about the situation that I'm in\nYeah\nNo you can never walk in my shoes dawg\nEven if I got my dude to make your shoes dawg\nYou know about that south we act like fools dawg\nYour girl says she like that country smooth drawl\nThat's why there's groupies ready to remove draws\nThey be going heavy duty til that Goose gone\nEvery single day I wake up to a new song\nThat's the sound of my formal introdushon\nI mean \"tion\"\nWhat's up?\nYou know, my flow\nCause it's B dot O\nAnd it's B dot O\nAnd it's B dot O\nAnd you know, my flow\nSo to all the people that's about to hate it\nHere's how I feel about you {burps}\nThere, I demonstrated\nHa, a politician so opinionated\nSo my style is addictive like simple lemonade is\nI'm in the building and I'm finna hit the stage\nYou can feel the tension and the sense of mental stimulation\nIf she's with me than she's not your lady\nAnd as we can see, she loves my babies\nMe go so crazy\nMe go so loco lately\nMostly because they raised me\nNo heat, no cold, no A.C\nYeah I'm just saying how I feel up in this booth\nOne of y'all surprise me and do something new"
