Smack him in his cabbage\nIn the woodwork\nCrack sales bubble like Woolworths in the projects\nRichest niggas rocking all the real worth\nPolice questioning, rooftop cats invested in\nTrading in they Lexuses, GSs, sending messages\nTwo and two makes four, Cristals crazily pour\nGun wars, my crew feel 'em like swords\n\n[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]\nWith the green leathers, hundred-pound snakes and cakes\nFiends found in lakes, jealously jakes we shake\nWhat I strive for is what I live for\nInfatuated by material things in this wild life of war\nLike somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold\nFuture stacks, so I hold\nThousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox\nDon't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac\nGot two spots on New Lots flooded with rocks\nShootouts making me hot, crooked cops, bag Tony and the ball drop\nIn denial, I'm banging niggas for slot time\nHurry up, duke, I'm next on line\nAnd what the fuck is you looking at?\nBy the way young blood hit me off with that Green Bay hat\nWatch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through\nLike doors, yo, you're staring in the mess hall\nYour adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindling\nNew jacks surrendering, come home not remembering\nMade bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt\nLooking gay in the yard and you got hurt\nFlashbacks of the day room, mop wringer style\nYour faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial\nYou told your boo you was wildin'\nOnce you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin\nHigh class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books\nInfirmary niggas are screaming, \"I got juxed\"\nSharpened toothbrushes, one-ninety mixed with baby oil and shit\nYour man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks\nWell I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top\nMe, Nas, and Rae got the best product on the block\n\n[Outro: Raekwon & Ghostface Killah]\nCream, my whole team is eatin' off of this good shit (Word up, throw your hands up)\nGood shit, nigga, next time, no more reload shit (Cock back the MAC if, say whatever your Hawaiian style)\nKeep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket (Exoticness, fly shit)\nRZA, Ghost, and Chef, and Nas, niggas in the profit (Floatin' on a nine-five in the wind)"

Filthiest fiends scream for more\nBless me out of state, howdy, Jake, Starks is back\nNiggas want work, nine brought back off a g-pack\nCoke rocks flood the co-ops, live in gossip\nThem big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it\nStop it, the projects over-flooded with slow leaks\nThe fiends geek, new faces get wrapped in sheets\nI gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese line\nSipping on fine wines, the power of the blacks refined\n(Rainy days) Divine\nWaiting on these royalties takes too long\nIt's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee\nBut that's ungodly, so, yo, God, pardon me\nI need it real quick, the dough flow like penmanship\nMeatheads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit\nSo now talk shit, nigga, what?\n\n[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]\nIt's raining, he's changing\nMy man is going insane, insane\nIt's raining (Past sunlight, more gunfight)\n\n[Verse 2: Raekwon]\nWhat brings rain, hail, snow, and earthquakes?\nThe beat breaks, 'cause all my niggas to break, son\nStyles is similar to criminals locked up\nWith gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up\nI live once, though the mind stays infinite\nTraveling to touch nine planets in my midst\nWhile I carry, to earn a decent salary\nSoon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be\nReal great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max\nAnd real cats cold watch my back\nBut listen to the Wu, son, and maintain\nIt's all real, starving individuals kill\nI puff what's only right, leave the poison alone\nProjects infested with rats, cats, and crack, holmes\nHalf of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it\nSo many fake, half real freedom-build\nBorn to science my alliance analyzes\nWild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this\nThe unfortunate, laying in mountains counting\nWith jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn\nChill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up\nI hate to have to tie the next guy up\nPay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends\nNow I'm steering you to truth, buckle up\nNow who's a legend?\n\n[Chorus: Blue Raspberry & Raekwon]\nIt's raining, he's changing (Word up dun)\nIt's raining he's\u2060\u2014, my man is going insane (Peace to Philly, VA, these days, word up, y'all)\nMy man is going insane (Word up, the sun, moon and stars, fly cars, word up y'all)\n\n[Outro: Blue Raspberry]\nNo sunlight, more gun fights\nI've lost him to the street life\nStreet life (I've lost him to the street life)\nNo cash flow, no more dough\nHe's someone I don't even know\nSomeone I don't know\nRainy Days\nGetting through those rainy days\nGetting through those rainy days\nGetting through those rainy days\nGetting through those rainy days\nI lost him to the street life\nThe street life, woah"

Like I used to always tell you, baby\nA good listener's a good learner\nI see you listened very well, you understand?\n(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)\nYour time is comin', baby\nAnd see, sometime, it could be like a, a rear view, you know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd people don't know when their blessing comes\nBut I've watched you grow, baby, man, and you's a very intelligent man\nMan, I watched you when I would just sit down\nAnd you would just trick me out my money, shootin' dice, nigga, is you crazy?

It's Alberta\nThis little boy quickly became a man\nFrom blowing in his father's church, to making his own band\nCalled the Moonglows, sensational with his vocals\nThat drove the ladies crazy, panties got thrown at his shows\nBut he was far from happy, he wore a smile just to hide it\nBehind them doors him and his father constantly colliding\n\n[Hook: Cee Lo Green]\nMarvin, the sound of your voice\nSets fire to my soul\nWhat a glory to behold\nMarvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how\nI just hope you're happy now\n\n[Verse 2: Raekwon]\nDestined for greatness, counting his blessings\nYoung'uns struggling with pressures\nThat the fact that his pops was a cross dresser\nBut he still loved him, you know the bond between his son and father\nThat only pushed him and forced him to sing harder\nHis main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car\nBelieved his sound\nAnd took him down to Motown y'all\nThat's where it all happened\nSuccess in the palm of his hand\nBut unfortunate the fame wasn't enough\nHe wanted more out of life\nTook it further and found himself a wife\nPretty Anna Gordy, she made his time sit still\nShe was the cousin of Barry G, the founder of Hitsville\nPlease pay attention because the story it gets ill\nShit's real, trials and tribulations son's facing\nYou gotta play the cards you're dealt\nAin't no telling what life deals\nDeath will cause you to have night chills\nEnough to keep a nigga bothered\nEspecially when the negatives start coming from your father\n\n[Hook: CeeLo Green]\nMarvin, the sound of your voice\nSets fire to my soul\nWhat a glory to behold\nMarvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how\nI just hope you're happy now\n\n[Verse 3: Raekwon]\nMoney, women and drugs came into play\nNow wouldn't you know, there goes another happy home down the drain\nThat night life had him speeding through hell\nScarred by the death of Tammi Terrell\nCouldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill\nSecluding himself, from the music and the press\nHe was sick and really getting depressed\nTime passed so he bounced back on track\nNew and improved\nEven got himself a new wife too\nEverything is on the up and up, got his act together\nSpiritually he claims, you could see the glow up on this fella\nTried to make amends with his father\nBut the hatred is too strong, revolver in his palm\nThe warning that death was close\nHis mother screaming out \"Honey don't do it!\"\nOne shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids\nApril 1st he died on the spot the scene was so horrific\nHow a father could kill his own son defines wicked\n\n[Hook: CeeLo Green]\nMarvin, the sound of your voice\nSets fire to my soul\nWhat a glory to behold\nMarvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how\nI just hope you're happy now\n\n[Outro]\nMarvin\nMarvin\nIt's the sound of the music\nMarvin\nMarvin\nMarvin"

We will, we will\nWe will, we will\u2014here we go\n\n[Verse 1: Raekwon]\nWell it was late one night, walking through the park\nWith my leathered down coat and Wallabee Clarks\nGetting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist\nSo much excitement in the air, I was crisp\nMoney suitcase, Louis joint\n(yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)\nGo make it happen, black God and get rich\nSaw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit\nThey made a right on me, them last two dicks\nKnow I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car\nThey spun around again and blast their shit\nI dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5\nYou'se a live nigga, you almost smashed your shit\nI'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car\nNice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit\nNigga had a white eye, they both blacked down\nWhat's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip\nIt was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)\n\n[Verse 2: GZA]\nI told the Chef Raekwon, pump the brakes\nSlow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates\nRelease the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead\nThen the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said\n\"Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car\"\nPut your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar\"\nHe was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister\nDonut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher\nOn top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell\nOf his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell\nBeef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth\nThat was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs\nSame cops known for extorting pimps and booking whores\nAimed Glocks at me and Rae, cause they was looking for\nA few MCs wanted for a string of break-ins\nLast seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins\n\n[Hook: Slick Rick]\nWe will, we will, rob you\nWe will, we will, Glock you\nWe will, we will, what? who? (not you)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 3: Masta Killa]\nYou know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina\nPeace to Chef, Mr. Meth\nMove it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath\nGhostface Kill', U-G ill\nDeck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic\nAhh, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it\nYou might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street\nAllah Mathematics make the cypher complete\nSee knowledge is the foundation of existence\nTo know starts the spark of the flow\nWisdom activation of the Nation moving\nWise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters\nAnd the Masta, culture be the way of life\nFreedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power\nSpending hour after hour, preparing his self\nFor the hour, now look how refined\nWhen the mind and body is one, every part of me\nSupreme equality, manifest the nature of self\nG-O-D, now build and add on to the truth\nDestroy the bullshit, born incomplete"

   "lyrics": "Soms ga ik terug in mijn gedachtes. Om herinneringen op te halen. Je liet me los die gedachte kan ik niet loslaten. Ik mis je steeds vaker weet niet of dat ooit wel stopt. Denken aan jou maakt me blij maar tegelijk ook kapot. Ik heb nooit gezocht naar liefde maar jij bracht dat met je mee zou er altijd voor me zijn. Waarom liet je me alleen? Ik denk niet dat je weet wat je doet met mij! De liefde lijkt zover van de pijn. Maar het is toch hier me hart klopt voor jou maar het klopt niet. Soms wil ik jou vergeten maar mijn gedachte voor jou die stopt niet. Waarom ben je niet hier bij mij? Ik zweer d'r gaat geen dag voorbij dat ik niet aan je denk. Het doet me pijn om te weten dat je in mn hart maar niet in mn armen bent. Ik kan niet denken aan de toekomst als ik in het verleden blijf. Maar ik blijf liever kijken naar ons dan niet met je zijn. Ik zweer die gedachte die doet me pijn. Geen jij bij mij maar toch is het wij. Want ik zie mezelf niet zonder jou alsof ik op mezelf niet mezelf kan zijn. Ik snap niet waarom ik nog steeds wacht ik snap niet wat jij in die tijd dacht. Ik snap niet dat ik zoveel moeite in jou stak en dat al die moeite voor niks was. Gebroken ik voel niks meer. Zo gebroken, nee ik voel niks meer. Denken aan jou doet me pijn maar Ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. En ik hoop dat jij alles hebt wat je nodig hebt zonder mij. Ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik je mis en dat ik met zoveel vragen zit. Maar ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. Kijk ik snap niet veel van liefde maar weet dat ik dat had met jou dus als ik weet wat liefde is dan weet ik dat dat komt door jou. Zoveel geleerd van jou alles was gemeend met jou. Alles voelt zo leeg rond mij mis die late night dates met jou. Ik mis jou hand in mijn hand. Ik mis jou lip op mijn lip. Ik mis het om jou steeds te zeggen waarom ik jou leuk vind baby. Ik zie in je ogen dat die keuze niet jouw keus is. (Ik zie in je ogen dat die keuze niet jouw keus is). Ik liep en loop voor je. Ik word blij en word boos voor je liefde is iets speciaals. Dit gaat door je maag maar je weet dat ik kan koken voor je. Als geluk in de winkel lag zou ik het kopen voor jou. Je bent mijn queen maar wilt die kroon niet. Toen samen maar nu lonely. De liefde waait langzaam weg schatje maar mijn hoop niet. Je was mijn up up up toen ik down was. Ik had maar 1 wens en dat is dat je mijn vrouw was\nIk hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. En ik hoop dat jij alles hebt wat je nodig hebt zonder mij. Ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik je mis en dat ik met zoveel vragen zit. Maar ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij\nIk hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. En ik hoop dat jij alles hebt wat je nodig hebt zonder mij. Ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik je mis en dat ik met zoveel vragen zit. Maar ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij"

Snatched the reefer\nThat bitch is next, catch you on the sequel\nSwollen eyes, his face was pulverized\nTrying to be a hustler, two ounces he want to mobilize\nDumb dummy, no team, he barely had money\nFlying around, old ass Jag, buying blow from me\nSki mask robbing, jean wearing ho sweetass"

This what it does\nJust keep it in the family, all love\nLets put the plugs together and cake up, build up the buzz\nI write for real niggas who down, bring your hound with you\nThrow em a jewel with meat on it, now did you\nAnalyze it like a 27 inch, give me the wrench\nSo we can throw a niggas some heroin and Jane and Finch\n\n[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]\nBitch I'm from the ski mask school house\nWhere life stay complicated, intoxicated and gooned out\nAnd niggas ain't graduated but they can relate with they tool belt\nThat 2 for 10 crack stems, needles and spoons out\nOoh I need some paper, ooh my fingers itching\nI wish that Santa Claus would put a brick under my tree for Christmas\nA new wig for my bitch and two choppers off in my stocking\nBaking soda yola'n locking, you cop then drop the deposit\nSigned my life right on the dotted line, wrote it in blood\nGot my uncle wiping down my tires, sold em a dub\nNiggas know I rap for most of my days, I rap with my plug\nBefore I see my platinum album, I see my day with the judge, fuck it\nWhen I die tell my mama I'm in the mafia\nEcuadorian chick 'bout to scoop me up from LaGuardia\nA party you wanna stop but you can't give up the sport\nLittle stove Pyrex and fork, shouts to East New York, nigga"

They don't know, betta let 'em know\nThere they go, here we go\nWho don't know? They don't know, betta let 'em know\nThere they go, here we go\n\n[Verse 1: Raekwon]\nAyo Clientele Kidd\nLayin in the crib gettin' ill money, those who hate ours, they ain't get it\nGot rugby's on and 4/5ths\nAttractin' them niggas I go against, the money was his\nOne nasty unit of murderers, all type-a Goons'll watch\nThen four minutes later, they burglars\nI heard from the grapevine, mine made it\nElevate the name up, this gift got a reign and his game went up\nAnd now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics\nGo against it and it's instant vendettas\nHe run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in\nCrib in Africa with two lions\nSomethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions\nCame back wrapped it up, too sweet\nThe game is missin' somethin' unique\nI put too much to fall back on, I rather just sleep\n\n[Hook: Polite]\nCHEF! We designin', rhymin' with Diamonds\nCHEF! Ice Water, it was all in the timin'\nCHEF! He gave y'all niggas bricks on consignment\nCHEF! To the death and he Billboard climbin'\nCHEF!

To the death and he Billboard climbin'\n\n[Verse 2: Fat Joe]\nYeah uh\nYo Don Carta' bomb harder over nearly everybody\nVery rarely you find me without the mini-shotti\nJust waitin' for Rae to give me the cue and\nYou see about 100 Puerto Rican niggas shootin'\nNigga, get down, lay down, we don't play around\nI don't know what you heard but, we don't play around\nIt's cooked coke, but look, but what the fuck happened?\nHow you leave the dope game to pursue rappin'?\nAlready knowin' that ya shit was trash\nBreathin' hard on the mic when yo' click is ass\nAll we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap\nAnd you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that\nUh, we much better than y'all, Terre-error the Squad\nMy niggas set it when we get in the yard\nWhether Marcy or Comstock, triggers 'pon cock\nStraight punch in ya lung and you niggas gon' drop\nWhat?\n\n[Hook: Polite]\nCHEF!

(nah)\nFuck him, get the gasoline tell Terry to pull the Ac' up\nBring him to Rae warehouse, hang him from hooks then skin his ass\nAs lame as he look he ready to cook (yeah)\nAnd he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty\nThe first week we made him eat shit!\nVideotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch\nMade him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids\nSo what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?\nOr you in the box laid under the floor?\nOr keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?\nMy murder chainsaw, ya bloods on my Scarface walls\nNot even Ajax can clean that, Jack\nWe need that maintenance man shit that kill that greasy blood on contact\nFinish you off cuz I'm pressed for time\nYour man and 'em will be next to die\nMothafucka!\n\n[Hook: Polite]\nCHEF!

   "lyrics": "[Raekwon]\nAiyo, Rockstars, bases and capers flying through cases\nWith placed bread, lead blowing through domes, scalped faces\nMoving through towns, skama lit, nations bend stations\nDope fiend Asians, smoke cream vanquishes\nThe town is thirsty for work, blood hurting\nFlash the curtain, open, I'm scoping, Hutch and his team\nClutching Dutches Backwoods, other shits working, not perfect\nFlipping discussions, cussing all froze with slush, kid\nLacer had the drop, pass the Glock, Woosie uzi\nThe car hard bluesy with the pay me mean 'Bach\nCream shot, clean slot, one in his dome, four shock\nHe partially zoned, his dome fell on the rock\nHis face dazzle, niggas baffle, son, hit the floor, he traveled\nYo, to a new land, I cracked his cerebellum\nWide open, open the crowd up, he fouled up, black laid in the hall\nFor like forty-five to an hour, soaking\n\n[Hook: Thea Van Seijen]\nSound of the smoking barrel, live like them older stars\nScrooge like a Christmas Carol, stemmed from a bloody love\nShot through the old apparel, no police to respond\nDropped off the Verrazano, washed up On Golden Pond\nJust like a Shakespeare novel, more problems to dissolve\nIf this is destiny, that's how this world revolves\n\n[Inspectah Deck]\nAiyo, it's real, better pop your steel\nCop those wheels, shop those deals\nFull time with the grind for a meal\nStay down low like O'Neal\nRain, hail, snow or shine, put time on the field\nPolice ride on my heels\nStill big time, big dime, how you feel\nI rhyme but the nine stay peel\nI, zone on roam, floss with the chrome on chrome\nHost on the corner store\nS.I.N.Y. on my own, it gets foul, but I call it home\nLive red bone give me dome, champagne toast to Tone\nRoll a bone, a homegrown with Capone\nCause more rips to the o-zone, wanna ride with a nigga then hold on\n\n[GZA]\nThe place was very smokey and cloudy, the full lousy\nMusic was emotional, people vibes was laid back and far from rowdy\nShe sit at the bar, holding a glass, sipping on a drink\nTears flowing like water from a sink, her eyes never blink\nHer cigarette was burnt to the butt, her wrist was wearing a cut\nHer facial expression was saying \"now what\"\nAnother drink was made, each and every time the bass was played\nBartender telling her to go, but then she only stayed\nRiding on the borderline, between homicidal, suicidal\nJust hours from the headlines, the story with the grim title\nShe questioned her reason for being here, but even with\nFour kids at home alone, it still remains unclear\nOpens up a bottle of prescribed drugs and grabs a mug\nDown, every one of those pills, since she was feeling bugged\nKinda weak, she stumbled from her seat, but she will never return\nI guess it must of been a, lesson to learn\n\n[Hook]"

Mine's is real\nWe used to have to rob and steal\nWe cook, cook whatever for a bit of a meal\nYeah, they don't wanna see us win how I'm beginning to feel\nBut still I stand firm, posted up\nThey say knowledge is power, I soak it up\nKush pounds came here we broke it up\nI said good morning to Toronto and woke it up\nWake up, bitch I'm here, it ain't a secret\nMy third eye twitching, the way I peeped it\nA G's incense when the weed lit\nAnd keep the white girls moving like the peach pit\nThat's some deep shit, I do it for my dawgs like I breed pits\nCream polo, matching clean kits\nCollege rings got a nigga feeling like a genius\nParanoid of the lights when they flashing\nCash out big, money cashing, flow's everlasting\nSwag like my passion is fashion\nI'm on, no lights, camera, action, Era"

I know that it's right\nThe way that I'm feelin'..\nHe touches me.. in ways I like\nSays things you won't.. won't day or night\nGivin' me healin..

Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers\nEven the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping\nAll my kins blew up, we grew up with\nWe used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping\nPick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby\nYou know how we do, come run in my boots, baby\nThe niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah\nEver since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Rah\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Method Man]\nReunited, another LP, we're all excited\nThat wreckless eyeballing'll get your girl indicted\nMy touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis\nThese niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis\nYour man don't snooze, insomniac\nThis The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?\nHands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals\nIf you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you'se a cannibal\nAnd stopping me, is what you can not do\nEither get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through\nI ain't different Method Man like you\nBut you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough\nAnd little kids in my community cuss\nYa'll be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust\nAnd when they do, you get a jewel re-up\n\n[Hook]"

A lot of niggas gotta see that man, immobilizing is the best thing right now coming from whatever we came out of, you know?\n\nYeah, but they don't make cats like you no more, baby.

The world is yours\n\nWe got a plan though\n\nThe world is yours\n\nWe have no interests, no investments in anything illegitimate. Don't ever underestimate the power of forgiveness. This is real shit right here, I'm tellin' you\n\nMr. Raekwon and his associates is prepared to deposit 500 million dollars in the Rap Vatican bank. Such times as Mr. Raekwon and his associates receive majority control of the Immobilarity\n\nImmobilarity? Immobilarity could be somethin' new, baby. It's a international conglomerate. A few families have control of such companies. These are important things that a black man like myself and like others need to know. And that's gon' bring about nature. Nature takin' it's course. Come on, let's add on. What you feel? Talk to me now\n\nThis is not a question of one person deciding one vote. It's not like any other company in the world! We have directors, we have rules, we have very old rules. I have a board I have to answer to, they have to approve you\n\nJust when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in"

The one you got your ideas from\nHow soon you start to suffer, until you get stuck up\nWhen you start to fuck up, that's when you get bucked up\nBitin me, you think you dope, I smash your boat, with bad coke\nYou should of wrote, because I ain't no joke\n\n[Hook 2X: Ultra]\nIt's been a long time, I shouldn't have let you\nWithout a re-up to connect to\nThink of all the weak product you slept through\nTime's up, I'm sorry I kept you\n\n[Raekwon]\nI was a fiend, before I was seventeen\nI melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen\nIt's all in the making, from where hip hop was originated\nPeace to the streets, the bubblers, mark & dated\nCuz I grab the mic, now I say \"yes ya'll\"\nYa'll yell 'scrape it', then I'mma say 'let's ball'\nCome on, cool, cuz I'mma get on rep\nTwist a 'dro on the speaker, pull the snub and then flex\nBack to them crabs, ya'll niggas had ya'll laughs\nAnd then I spaz on the rhymes I splashed\nFrom back to your brother gun, then I grab the double pump\nThen this the opposite, and ask if another come\nCuz I'mma get busy, get dough with my team, yup\nI don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?\nI'm raging, rip up the stage and don't it amazing\nCuz every line is laid in\nCaught up, thoughts are sort a, an addiction\nBags of pies, smell of bricks, kid\nVocals vocabulary, the stage is a suction\nThe mic is a draino, volcanos erupting\nLines overblowing, gradually glowing\nEvery thing is written in the cold, slick & coin'\nSlide.. my thoughts'll glide\nForty-eight MAC's and knives\nThe invincible, microphone fiend, Raekwon\nSpread the word, cuz it's on\nB-E-R-E-A-L, a smooth operator with notorious crack sales"

And bring it back\nThe best and my cleaver came with me\nYo, King with me, reload quickly\nI'm surely down fifty a cheeba, elloquently\nI relax in the Waldorf\nUnder the covers, and the sword off\nSweat this shit, growing a mohawk\nReady to blow off"

Yeah, living legend\nThey say nothing worth having comes easily\nLet's go get in, buzz it down and spread it out evenly\nCamouflage my rides, blend with the scenery\nAnd bang in the face of my enemy\nDivine from the waist ain't no killing me, it runs in my family\nBloodline, prepare for the best, through tough times\nFifty car caravan, anything jumping\nGot the wheel real big with the rims still rubbing\nBut my rims ain't touching, I'm a Defcon button\nI'm a Russian made Kalashnikov, motherfucker\nThe same thing that builds you up, ain't reserve notes\nWatermarks stacked, In God We Trust\nBut any man can and will be crushed, heaviest move like elephant tusk\nThink you better adjust the way you approach, don't get too close\nBecause you might get hit with a shitbag, and a wheelchair dented in zig-zag\n\n[Hook]\nLegacy, you're the don, legacy, you're the king\nStories of the hood, lights, the fame bring\nWe runs the past, the strong survive\nFor perfection we strive, the legends alive\n\n[Murs]\nHuh, Murs, yo\nNow when I first started out, they said I wouldn't make it\nI'm made of less metal, probably just couldn't take it\nI roll with my aces, certified assassins\nMid-city militia, we come through smashing\nWe fucking with them butterknives, we swinging them katanas\nSharper than piranhas, cutting through your body armor\nIt's all about honor, man, respect the code\nTouch a point on your neck and make your chest explode\nAnd the water turns vets into vegetables\nYou gotta, stay on point or be the next to go\nWhether, dickies or chucks, or the guess and low\nIt's all one love, homie, rep your coast\nCause fame is elusive, respect is the prize\nIs he less of a man, you can check through his eyes\nThose guys with subversive plots\nBe the ones you despise, and the first to watch, hah\n\n[Hook]"

(What up playboy?)\nYeah, yeah this is Shaolin reporting in (OK)\nCheckin' you out, I'm hearin' about Force Reveal (yeah, yeah)\nThey said one kid, that's standin' real grown out there right now\n(I, go, by the name of Posta)\nThat's my man! So, yo, son? (What up, Rae?)\nYou know what you gotta do!\n\n[Postaboy]\nAiyo, I don't give a fuck what level you on\nWhen the metal is drawn, either your life or your bezel is gone\nI don't really wanna hurt ya'll fags but I'm sitting on paper\nI got Universal mad, Raekwon in a purple Jag\nP.B. in a cantaloupe Hummer with commercial tags\nYa'll ask the chicks who wrap the bricks\nI'm out to give Harlem, a quick flashback of Rich\nI'm blow like C4, burn up be more\nLayin' that Cheetah, next day in a G4\nThink like a veteran, choppin' and measurin'\nAlways got a way, but God got eleven in\nLittle kids follow me, women, they acknowledge me\nNew year, new rules, and a new policy\nPosta good, Posta hood, Posta real, Posta do what Posta could\nP.B. stay blowin' a stink\nWhen the girls give me a hug, they all smell the dro on the mink\nGo line for line, dart for dart, heart to heart\nWe layin' on top of charts\nSee me buggin on Melrose, low top shell toes\nSuede addition, U.S. don't sell those\nPosta hot, Posta not, did Posta flop?\nPlease get off of, of Posta cock\n\n[Interlude; Postaboy]\nOK? Ya'll little chumps roll out the red carpet\nFor the Postaboy, man, I got Uncle Rae with me\nRaekwon the Chef, is in the building\nMight wanna holla!\n\n[Raekwon]\nCatch me at a Balley convention, sweater look, worth the money\nAuctionin' and buy me a building\nMatter fact niggas, might try to bubble in it\nYou know, the X.T. Click, niggas fell in love with it\nJumpin' out of Akademic jumpers, Nike pumps, jewelry down\nG'in' like Trump, sweetie, you drunk\nPosition my thoughts, heavy loss\nRoot for the Maybach, one for your girl, you write it off\nWith the new color, only six made, we in the world, like\nWhatever we rockin', that's on the trade\nWhata's the verdict? It's murder, we preserve, niggas\nAutomatic birds, hang gun hammers, grenades, got words on you\nSwerve on you, browsin', all through your housing\nJakes stop me, try to take forty thousand\nPlayin' it kid, you won't make a thousand\nYeah, the Larry Davis version, force to build Shaolin\n\n[Outro: sample]\nBut now my time, has come\nAnd time, time, is not on you side"
