With his white contacts distinguishing him from his peers, he was signed with Ruthless Records from 2006 through to 2009, leaving due to numerous issues with the label, and its head, Tomica Wright. He co-founded his own independent label, Funk Volume, whose roster includes such artists as SwizZz, Dizzy Wright, DJ Hoppa & Jarren Benton.\n\nIn early 2016, Hopsin took to social media to talk about how he was going to leave Funk Volume because of problems with his Co-Founder Damian \u201cDame\u201d Ritter and would start his new record label called Undercover Prodigy, that wasn\u2019t just a record label with merchandise, but an entire clothing line as well."

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMan, I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it\nI've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at\nWho walk around bumpin' Raw with the shit blarin'\nSaying \"Fuck school!\" and droppin' out like a miscarriage\nI'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed\nI played a part in this devilish game\nMakin' your common sense perish\nBut I ain't takin' the full blame\n'Cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents\nAll of your brain cells rottin' from weed\nYou feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete\nYou havin' sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see\nWith a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat\nBut still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be\nWithout the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep\nMakin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean\nWhile your favorite rapper's like, \"Yeah, he got it from me\"\nYou been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'\nWhen I say the word \"fun,\" what do you envision?\nProbably drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'\nWith clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' New Edition\nIs that all you think life really is?\nWell, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot\nI honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it\nMatter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain \u2014 give me it!\nDo you even have any goals\nAside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?\nWell, let me guess \u2014 no\nYou're only in school because your parents make you go\nWhen all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros\nYo, society's got you livin' for a whack cause\nYou're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all\nYou don't read any books or play ball\nYou don't draw \u2014 you literally do nothing at all!\nStill you fiend for the glamorous fruits\nYou don't have, 'cause you idolize rappers that do\nAnd all they say is, \"I got money and it's stacked to the roof\"\nAnd now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?\nHow? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor\nYou pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later\nThen you complain about your life 'cause it ain't gettin' catered\nNow whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?\nYou wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older\nAnd regret it all 'cause you can't provide\nYour friends are lowlives, don't act surprised\nLook, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirls, stop actin' like you want a guy\nWith traits like Romeo \u2014 bitch, that's a fuckin' lie!\nYou always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it\nAnd you want somethin' real \u2014 shut up, tramp, save it!\nTwice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets\nAnd head to the club half-naked with your ass shakin'\nPullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash-makin'\n'Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station\nOne of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it\nBut you caused it, your actions made a fat statement\nYou want Romeo, then act patient\nAnd stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'\nIt's the club, where guys put on a new persona\nAfter they get loaded with a few Corona's\nThey always shoutin' and wild out\nWith habits that very few condone of\nThen they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em\nThen when they leave you, you cry and cry\nTalkin' about, \"Oh my god, I can't find a guy!\nI've spent so many years and I've tried and tried!\nWhy am I even on Earth? I should die!\"\nYou want Romeo, you're not worthy\nYou're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes\nSometimes the secret to findin' is to stop searchin'\nTry a new formula, 'cause your last one's not workin'\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe term \"real nigga\" is publicly used\nAnd I need to know what it means, 'cause I'm fuckin' confused\nAre you one for always bustin' your tool\nWith nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove\nTo homies up in your crew?\nIs it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot\nAnd brag about how you done been shot and stabbed\nLike it's fun to be you?\nBut your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?\nNah, you hamster-ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop\nMan, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?\n'Cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal\nIt's clear you can't stand the law\nYou're lost as an abandoned dog\nAnd all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball\nI can't even fuck with you\n'Cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too\nYou'll get old and be nothin'\nLivin' life in these streets, thuggin'\nAnd starting shit with anybody mean-muggin'\nLook at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool\nGirls used to turn me down for guys who were like you\n'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through\nThen they regret it because it wasn't the right move\nYour \"real nigga\" talk seems bogus\nA real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it\nAnd his future doesn't seem hopeless\nA real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused\n\n[Verse 4]\nTo all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong\nYou inspired the issue I wrote about in this song\nYou go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums\nSee, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums\nHope the hour is long when I'm rollin' out with your tongue\nThe man above is my guide, you know the power is strong\nAll you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese\nAnd the mass-control limit was breached \u2014 fuck hip-hop!\nThey only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see\nThey purposely makin' the innocent weak\nMy existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me\nYo, we need to make a change while there's still time\nIt is hard, and sometimes I struggle tryin' to reveal mine\nI can guide you if you feel blind\nI just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind"

   "lyrics": "[Produced By Hopsin]\n\n[Hook]\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind power\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind power\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, fuck anybody I might alarm\nLife is a tour, I sit and ride along\nTakin' some notes and then I write the songs\nI\u2019m starin' down the road my life has gone\nIs this where I belong?\nIs it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?\nMy mental state is fuckin' me up, and I cried a pond\nWhile asking you for some answers\nBut we don\u2019t have that type of bond\nThat my desires gone with the way that I\u2019ve been livin' lately\nIf I died right now, you\u2019d turn the fire on\nSick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sell-out\n'Cause I hopped to Christianity so strongly, then I fell out\nNow I\u2019m avoidin' questions like a scared dog with his tail down\nFeelin' so damn humiliated\n'Cause they lookin' at me like I\u2019m hellbound\nWhat story should I tell now? I\u2019ll just expose the truth\nI'm so close to the fuckin' edge, I should be close to you\nBut who the fuck are you? You never showed the proof\nAnd I\u2019m only fuckin' human, yo, what am I supposed to do?!\nThere\u2019s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions\nBeggin' all fuckin' men and women to listen\nI can\u2019t even beat my dick without gettin' convicted\nThese ain\u2019t wicked decisions, I got different intentions\nI've been itchin' to get it, I\u2019ve been given assistance\nBut the whole fuckin' system is twisted\nNow I\u2019m dealin' with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian\nAnd I\u2019ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction\nBut I can\u2019t buy it, it\u2019s just too hard to stand beside it\nI need an answer, and humans can\u2019t provide it\nI look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it\nIt\u2019s truly mind-blowin', I can\u2019t deny it\nIs Heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?\nWhere\u2019s the Holy Ghost at? How long\u2019s it take a man to find it?\nMy mind\u2019s a nonstop tape playin' and I can\u2019t rewind it\nYou gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it?!\nI\u2019m frustrated and you provoked it\nI\u2019m not readin' that motherfuckin' book, because a human wrote it\nI have a fuckin' brain, you should know it\nYou gave it to me to think, to avoid every useless moment\nIt was a mission that I had to abort\n'Cause humans be lyin', we're such an inaccurate source\nIt\u2019s gon\u2019 be hard to put me back on the course\nNext Jehovah\u2019s Witness to come on my porch\nI swear I\u2019m slammin\u2019 the door\nA lot of folks believe it though, but I\u2019m not surprised\nHumans are fuckin' dumb, still thinkin' that Pac\u2019s alive\nI ain\u2019t tryin' to take your legacy and torch it down\nI\u2019m just sayin', I ain\u2019t heard shit from the horse\u2019s mouth\nJust sheep always tellin' stories of older guys\nWho were notarized by you when you finally vocalized\nNow I\u2019m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes\nAnd somehow let the Holy Ghost arise?\nSounds like a fuckin' Poltergeist!\nShow yourself, and then boom, it's done\nEvery rumor\u2019s gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you\u2019re the One\nI\u2019ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun\nAnd all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge\nI\u2019ll donate to a charity that could use the funds\nFuck the club; instead of bitches, I\u2019d hang with a group of nuns\nAnd everyone I ran into would know what I came to do\nI wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of you\nI hate the fact that I have to believe\nYou haven\u2019t been chattin' with me like you did Adam and Eve\nAnd I ain\u2019t seen no fuckin' talkin' snake unravel from trees\nWith an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me\nI don\u2019t know if you do or don\u2019t exist\nIt's drivin' me crazy, send your condolences\nThis is me reachin' to you, so don\u2019t forget\nIf Hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it\nI\u2019ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit\nMy gut feelin' says it\u2019s all fake\nI hate to say it, but fuck it, shit, I done lost faith\nThis isn\u2019t a small phase, my perspective\u2019s all changed\nMy thoughts just keep pickin' shit apart all day\nAnd in my mind I make perfect sense\nIf you aren\u2019t real, then all my prayers aren\u2019t worth a cent\nThat would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is\nAnd I could sit in church and say \u201cfuck\u201d in the services\nMan, what if Jesus was a facade?\nThen that would mean the government\u2019s God\nI feel like they\u2019ve been brainwashin' us with a lot\nSo much that we don\u2019t even notice that we\u2019re stuck in a box\nMan, everything is \u201cwhat if?\u201d \u2014 why is it always \u201cwhat if?\u201d\nPlanet Earth \u201cwhat if?\u201d, the Universe \u201cwhat if?\u201d\nMy sacrifice \u201cwhat if?!\u201d, my afterlife \u201cwhat if?!\u201d\nEvery fuckin' thing that deals with you is fuckin' suspect\nI\u2019m fuckin' done! I\u2019m fuckin' done!\nThis is my fuckin' life and I\u2019m livin' it, I\u2019m havin' fun\nIf you really care for me\nProve that I need to live carefully!\nBut I\u2019ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside\nFor an afterlife that isn\u2019t even guaranteed\nWe are you, and you\u2019re us \u2014 stop playin' games!\nMy life\u2019s all I got, and Heaven is all in my brain\nAnd when I feel I'm in Hell, my ideas are what get me through pain\nDo as you please, and I\u2019ll just do me\nI\u2019m a human, I\u2019ll stay in my lane; Ill mind\n\n[Hook]\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind power\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind power"

(What the fuck?)\nHomie, I made you rich, paid your rent (Damn right!)\nBitin' the hand that was feedin' you\nThis shit don't make any sense\nNigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)\nYou know this is that real shit\nHow you gon' forget who built this? (Huh?)\nI'm the one who made the company all the millions\nNow you got problems to deal with\nMan, this is tough luck, see a couple weeks ago we was buds\nAnd the crew that was killin' shit was us\n'Til you turned on me, homie, that's fucked up\nI ain't keepin' this shit on the hush, hush\nOn my chest I just carry too much stuff\nI done had it, enough is enough, bruh\nPlus I needed somethin' to get my buzz up\nYou done fucked with the wrong dude\nAin't no tellin' what Hopsin is gon' do, creepin' up on you\nQuit your sleepin', I told you\nThis a mothafuckin' journey we finna go through\nIf I ain't have so much to lose\nI swear to God I'd probably beat up and choke you (Damn!)\nNigga, this is that raw shit (Right?)\nThat organic flow you probably see up in Whole Foods\nShiver me timbers, somethin's fishy 'bout you, Mr. D Ritter\nWhen I told you that I wanted new management\nWhy the fuck you throw a fit and seem bitter?\nWhy you catch an attitude whenever I question you\nAbout all my fuckin' percentages?\nI know why (Why?), you've been bendin' it\nIn your benefit\u2014your honor, I'm innocent!\nThis nigga crazy, I'm tellin' all of my people (You tell 'em!)\nHe takin' all of my C-Notes (It's true)\nSee, he has a gamblin' issue\nHe takes the cash and blows it all at casinos (Damn!)\nUh-oh, when I bring up my royalties\nYou start avoidin' me, that's some disloyalty\nYou woke up the evil boy in me, your ass is poisonin\nTell me why you would destroy FV?\nThis was a fuckin' vision that I had created with your brother\nBut you too infatuated with the money\nYou killed it and ran it straight into the gutter\nNow I think, \"Why'd I make D\u2014A\u2014M\u2014E the boss?\"\nYou keep pissin' a whole lot of people off\nOur whole label came out with a weak result\nYou on that same bullshit Tomica brought\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, I don't know what you thought\nYou think I can't see the blood on the walls?\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nI don't know what you thought\nI can clearly see the blood on the wall\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\n\n[Interlude]\nHold up! Hold up!\nI got some more shit to say, yo\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's supposed to be Funk Volume, isn't it?\nThought it was music above all the business\nBut you just said: \"Fuck all you niggas!\"\nYou tarnished the brand\nAnd you started a Funk Volume Fitness?\nCome on now, really think\nGot us portrayin' somethin' we really ain't\nHow we supposed to be ill\nWhen you on our website with a Shake weight\nTryna be Billy Blanks\u2014nigga, thanks!\nFool, ain't nobody tryna lift weights\nWe just wanna hit up the studio and just rap and do shows\nBut you don't understand the culture of hip-hop\nYou a lame-ass nigga, Dame, half the crew knows\nNew-Age Jerry Heller, a scary fella\nI hate your fuckin' name, every letter\nI'm very fed up, you actin' like an ordinary heffa\nI'ma take you to the mortuary dress-up\nWe gave you our trust, then you had us cornered\nYou got us a shitty label deal with Warner\nAnd if I confront you about it\nYou tell me I need counsellin' and I got a disorder\nYou sent me on tour and it's horror\nShitty hotels, no sleep, with no food to order\nMeet and greets every single day, it's torture\nHow you expectin' an A1 performer?\nEvery time somethin's wrong it's the same thing (What?)\nBlah-blah-blah-blah, you just blame me (Damn!)\nThen you tell Brooklyn and Jammie (Damn!)\nNow they both thinkin' I'm crazy (Damn!)\nI deal with this on the daily (Damn!)\nMy career mentally rapes me (Damn!)\nI won't let this nigga break me\nHe prayin' Dizzy Wright is gon' replace me, shady\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat are your fuckin' motives, Dame? Let's talk about it!\nUmm, you're our manager, our label-owner, our accountant\nHmm, that's kinda tricky\nSomethin is fishy, that's risky\nWe just don't even know\nWe go with the flow while you rowin' the boat\nYou keepin' it simple-minded\n'Cause you knowin' our only concern is just hopin' we blow\nSo, when all the money come in from our album and tours\nYou sit there and soak in the dough\nWhen did we ever ask about the gross?\nWhen did we ever ask about the net?\nYou would just hand us money from our shows\n'Cause you knew we wasn't questionin' the checks\nNigga, I trusted you with my life\nYou upped your percentage so I'm makin' less?!\nFuck you, bitch, you get no respect!\nThis is why Hop is comin' for your neck (Bless!)\nAll you care about is makin' money\nYou don't care about a fuckin' soul though\nYou just fluctuate our dollars up and down\nAt your convenience like a fuckin' pogo\nYou been screwin' everybody on the label on the low\nAnd they don't even know though\nSo, good luck, Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz, I'm goin' solo\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, I don't know what you thought\nYou think I can't see the blood on the walls?\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nI don't know what you thought\nI can clearly see the blood on the wall\nBlood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\nEverybody knows you be on it\nAin't got time for your bullshit\n\n[Spoken Outro: Joel Osteen]\nChange is one of the most difficult things that we face. But change is inevitable\nOne reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do\nJust because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change\nEvery blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever\nIf you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYou think you're original? You ain't original\nYou were programmed to be you\nYou're a slave, and you don't even know it\nThe shit you think of, ain't even your thoughts\nLet's step out the box for a minute!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow do we know if God exists? How do we know it's positive?\nAre you the definition of an angel or the opposite?\nIf you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit to stealin' it\nBut if the tables turned, then you would pocket it\nSee, I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is\nHow come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?\nI show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it\nBut in the underground I seem to get so many compliments\nSay my name and it's like people get afraid and shook\nBut if you take a look, you'll see I'm nothin' like an angry crook\nI'm learnin' hands-on, you busy with your face in books\nI'm here to benefit the world, so Heaven's where we're safely put\nI'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues\nI just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs\nI'm from where a child's future's on the streets with the bums\nBecause it's hard to become somethin' so unique where I'm from\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power, then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Verse 2]\nObama's president, so? What's he represent?\nJust because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent\nYou're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with\nHis charmin' smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit\nFrontin' like he's truly Jesus, and all you fools believe it\nThe change he's makin' isn't good, that's just how you conceived it\nIt's like we're all broker than ever, it's due to reasons\nDealin' with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with\nIlluminati, or whatever the fuck they go by\nThey're the reason weird shit happens and we don't know why\nWhy did Michael Jackson start his tour, then have to go die?\nHow did rap music go from really good to so dry?\nReal artists get shelved and wack ones get famous\nTo leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous\nIn their eyes; there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist\nYou're just a product of what the government has created\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, we're all smart, and we know what's bad and good for us\nBut yet, when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff\nYour brain's a fuckin' powerhouse, but what, that wasn't good enough?\nIt's people like you who talk that \"shoulda, coulda, woulda\" stuff\nYou probably threw your life away \u2018cause you would rather get high\nWith no license or car, so you bum rides to get by\nSayin', \"I should've did this\" or \"I shouldn't have hung with this guy.\"\n\"I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized.\"\nI ain't bein' cruel with these situations that I address\nI more than likely could be someone you admire, yes\nBut it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest\nWe play the same game, difference is you never try your best\nYou don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess\nI work around the clock, you slack off for lots of time to rest\nKeep bullshittin' till your life is gone\n\u2018Cause livin's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun's down\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nIt may seem so that I can't see\nBut the darkness provides the light for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nAnd the moon is my only homie\nIf there's a higher power then show me\nInstead of nocturnal rainbows\n\n[Outro]\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high\nNocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high"

Who knows?\nThey convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do\nSayin' it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible\nSo you started skippin' school\nHangin' with these wicked dudes\nUnaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool\nAnd it\u2019s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?\nIn they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house\nBack when you met 'em I had doubts\nThey put you on the bad route, and when you needed they help to pick you up, they fuckin' backed out\nThey fuckin' got you, I can\u2019t lie, but now your brain's fried\nYou don\u2019t even act like you\u2019re the same guy\nYour momma told you that drugs are bad\nBut you ain\u2019t listen 'til the fire burned your ass\nNow you understand\n\n[Hook]\nNow you always look like you don\u2019t know me\nAnd I\u2019m mad at the world\n'Cause the meth took away my homie\n(Give me back my homie, please come home!)\nI just wanna chill on the neighborhood block\nLike we used to (Where\u2019d you go?)\nI never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future\nBut I was wrong\n\n[Verse 3]\nI ain\u2019t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore\nI reminisce on us playin' Nintendo 64\nAnd that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards\nAnd we was doin' ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor\nShit changed and it happened quick, but I can\u2019t forget\nThat you was the first homie I started rappin' with\nYou could\u2019ve had half of this back when I had established it\nBut now I have to sit and feel bad\nLook at what your actions did!\nMan, you were so outgoin' and so hysterical\nSeein' you now is just unbearable, it\u2019s terrible\nYou should've made your choices wisely\nFuckin' with poison ivy; without your brain, please tell me, what would your point in life be?\nIt\u2019s a struggle to get your ass to listen\nReally hurt me and the rest of your family\nWith all your bad decisions\nWe always told you that drugs are bad\nBut you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass\nNow you understand\n\n[Hook]\nNow you always look like you don\u2019t know me\nAnd I\u2019m mad at the world\n'Cause the meth took away my homie\n(Give me back my homie, please come home!)\nI just wanna chill on the neighborhood block\nLike we used to (Where\u2019d you go?)\nI never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future\nBut I was wrong\n\n[Outro]\nExcuse me, do you need a ride?\nLooks like you\u2019re goin' downtown\nYes, hop in my ride!\nWell, hi, I\u2019m Chris Dolmeth\nI\u2019m your best friend (Chris Dolmeth)\nI\u2019m all you need (Chris Dolmeth)\nIf you wanna succeed, hop in my ride\nWell, hi, I\u2019m Chris Dolmeth"

Hm, okay then\nAm I the only one that noticed humans on the same shit?\nY'all thoughts are sailin' on the same ship\nAnd if that's the case, then that's the reason that you ain't shit\nLet me enlighten you, my niggas, just let your brain drift\n\n[Verse 1]\nFirst of all, the best type of marketin'\nIs marketin' that doesn't feel like marketin'\nIt makes the people feel like they a part of it\nAnd when it's done right, corporations think it's marvelous\nThey feed us these ideas and then we place 'em in our hearts to sit\nIt's why players are good at gettin' chicks\nIt's why Nike is good at sellin' kicks\nIt's why Disney is loved by all the kids\nWhy McDonald's owners are super rich\nWe're too blinded to ever see 'em pitch\nSee, when this happens we take our health\nWealth, lives, and just hand them off\nThinkin' that we did this from organic thoughts\nI know you seen parents trick kids\nWith candy, toys and Santa Claus\nThe same method is used to trap adults\nBut instead of candy it's with money, religion, drugs and alcohol\nMention that shit and it's gon' arouse us all\nI done seen niggas get into fights\nOver cigarettes like a pack of dogs\nThey get you hooked and then they laugh at y'all\n\n[Hook]\nI really hate to break it to you\nBut your life's being played with\nYou have not witnessed the world\n'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix\nEverything we have been taught was all a lie\nOpen your eyes, open your mind, and fly!\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, can't you see we're robots\nWho know not what we do and we got no shot\nIn the real world until we climb out of this ice-cold box\nYour whole life has been part of a whole plot\nTo keep you at the bottom while they on top\nStay quiet, then they won't stop\nThey always tryna show us what we don't got\nThey do it to all of us 'til we finally break and go cop a gold watch\nKnowin' we need the cash for rent, my ass is sick\nJust thinkin' about how rich and powerful all these bastards get\nThey package ideas like it's oxygen\nThey make us feel like if we ain't got it we're fucked and we cannot fit in\nThis fuckin' system is not your friend\nAnd understand they controllin' your thoughts 'cause they got a lot to win\nNiggas get turned away when I mention this\nIgnorance is bliss, but I don't give a fuck, I won't censor shit\nThe Matrix is real and you done entered it\nIt's way too intricate for you to ever realize it you fuckin' simpleton\n\n[Hook]\nI really hate to break it to you\nBut your life's being played with\nYou have not witnessed the world\n'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix\nEverything we have been taught was all a lie\nOpen your eyes, open your mind, and fly!\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, fuck Hollywood! Fuck all these reality shows!\nMakin' us feel lame unless we blowin' stacks on new clothes\nMakin' us feel like we ain't cool unless we have a few hoes\nMakin' us feel like we ugly unless we have a new nose\nI see naturally beautiful women get Botox, fake tits\nFake lips, they so brainwashed and it doesn't make sense\nFocus on your life and the path you're pursuin'\n'Cause y'all too busy worried 'bout what Kim Kardashian's doin'\nCheck it, most of this shit that you sheep are watchin' on television\nIs fake as fuck and is not real, I rebel against it\nIt's the Devil's business, they just reel y'all in\nIf they say it we do it, yo I'm tryna tell y'all, man\nThe system created the stereotype for the Black image\nThat's why my people are scared to be different\nWhy don't you get it? I'm done practicin' these ridiculous rituals\nIt's time I become a real individual and just do me\n\n[Hook]\nI really hate to break it to you\nBut your life's being played with\nYou have not witnessed the world\n'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix\nEverything we have been taught was all a lie\nOpen your eyes, open your mind, and fly!\n\n[Outro]\nUse your mind, be yourself\nDon't blame nobody else but you\nYou and the meaning of life\nHas no rules, no rules, no rules\nFly away! Fly away! Away, away, away!\nLife's too short not to live it\nThe world is all yours, come get it\nJust go and get it, it's beautiful"

Are you loving your existence?\nI wasn't at your birth, 'cause your mother made me miss it\nI tried to get a visa, I applied and they denied it\n'Cause your momma told the police that I beat her, she was lyin'\nAnd now I'm banned for something bad that I ain't even do\nThere's a lot of land and water separating me and you\nYou're far away in Australia and I am in America\nSo I cannot be there to do all of the things a parent does\nThis is my attempt at me raisin' you from a distance\nYou have Hopson in your blood, you are special and you are gifted\nThe punishment your mother has given me doesn't seem fair\nJust know I love you, son, and I'm wishin' that I could be there\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (it's sad)\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nNow sing it with me, son!\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (yeah, that's it)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(That's why what?) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you and your momma stayin' with her parents Bill & Kirsten\nYou're partially black, I'm confident they're feelin' nervous\nThey don't like colored people, in their eyes you're still a burden\nThey assume you gonna grow up shootin' guns and stealin' purses\nBut that's not true, son, don't be sad\nI know you're not like that, you know I got your back\nListen, here's a funny joke that you could tell your grandmother\nShe looks like the Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters\nOh, I forgot, you're too young to know what that is\nBut that's the kinda thing I like to say to plumpy fat chicks\nThe humps on Mom's chest, they're not real, they're elastic\nAnd if you look closely, you can see she's made of plastic\nLike a toy, you my boy, my son, my friend\nI promise we gon' be together somehow in the end\nI am very ashamed that you don't have my last name\nEvery night I go to bed and I'm feelin' this wicked pain, because\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nYou know what time it is, son\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (that's right)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(Daddy doesn't fuck with who?) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n\n[Verse 3]\nCurrently my life has hit the floor\nI can't lie to you, shit is hard\nI should be buildin' with the Lord\nIt could be what I'm missin' or\nMaybe I should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more\nJust to relieve the tension that sits in my heart, 'cause it is sore\nWhen I'm spittin' bars about all my cash and exquisite cars\nThis was on my vision and you were the one I did it for\nMy relationship with your momma is sittin' in the morgue\nAfter all this hell, I can't lie, I do wish she did abort\nOur lives are so unhappy\n'Cause this world is cold and nasty\nJust know your daddy don't condone havin' a broken family\nI'm so sad we couldn't work out our issues 'fore you arrived\nAnd now you have to suffer\n'Cause Mom and Daddy have stupid lives\nYou're way too young to notice it\nYou don't deserve to go through this\nIf I do see your mom again, this time I will assault the bitch\nAt least then I'll feel like my banning was justified\nLook at your momma, thank her for fuckin' up all our lives, and sing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nWhere's my choir at?\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (Momma had to fuck it all up)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(Daddy doesn't fuck your momma) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, son\nI'm sorry I can't be there with you\nBut I'll be there soon\nBut Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (no, no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nJust know that\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma (hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma"

It's Knock Madness\nYeah, I'm back up in this, I'm a real nice nigga, but I rap with vengeance\nOnly got bad intentions and I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack could fit in\nI look like an idiot to grab attention, but my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses\nIt's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses, feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension\nStepped in this bitch to wreck so don't disrespect, I promise that it'd be a big regret\nI'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch, I chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech\nI got hoes all over that wanna give me (Dome), they all yellin', \"Hopsin, you turn me (On)\"\nBut I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me (Whoa,) and I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me (Home)\nNigga, I'm so cool (Cool), but I feel so low (Low)\nSee, I got a crew (Crew), but I feel solo, I cruise (Cruise), but the wheels don't roll (Whoa)\nYou feel what I'm sayin'?

I made a million bucks but did not get amused\nHow did I manage to get robbed from the truth?

Fuck! Fuck!) I'm paranoid, I panic over every little scary noise\nSee, when I go pick up the phone and tell friends about it they won't answer, 'cause they're annoyed\nI'm like ugh, I put a porno on, 'cause my life ain't awesome, man (Yeah, yeah)\nJack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again (Yeah, yeah)\nThen repeat the cycle, can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on\nYou don't know how many fuckin' demons I know, maybe I should go and tell 'em read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)\nI don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool (Be cool)\nAnd hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby Doo (-By Doo)\nBut I got way more than I bargained for, you can't kill when your heart is sore\nI'm so mad I could start a war, so fuck Hopsin!

The one where the dumb skippity bums get high\nThat there changed my whole entire life, you make more tings like that?

   "lyrics": "They tell me that my vibe is too dark, my eyes are too harsh\nThat's all I ever hear when I rhyme a few bars\nI kinda live a rapper's life, shit, minus two cars\nAnd free girls to fuck\n'Cause where I'm from the hynas do charge\nMy label hyped me up\nAnd told me I had about twelve hits\u2014they lied\n'Cause when my fuckin' album dropped, I didn't sell shit\nWell, bitch, you tried to fuck my life up? You nailed it!\n'Cause you didn't promote my record\nAnd I don't know who the hell did\nYou shoulda hired Tanner Guinn, yup, Hop is mad again\nJust enough to leave your little skull frame hammered in\nSee, this is what happens when I take that little magic pen\nAnd get to scribblin' psychotic lines worth some damagin'\nI hate to tell you, but you are crazy\nYou were born as a retard baby\nAnd when I come around, you start shaking\n'Cause you're a bitch who dates hard ladies\nWith big beards who say, \"Arr, matey!\"\nYo, Pillow Man the alias Hopsin has been the signature\nI'm far from similar to you niggas whose flow is minature\nYou'll be diminished for crossin' limits on my perimeter\nI'm not a gimmick, I'm a committed, demented, sinister\nIt's Funk Volume, now what?\nIf you thinkin' that rap's officially dead, you haven't found us\nWe built the movement from the ground up, your sound sucks\nUntil now we let you slide, but you're now fucked\nIt's just reality, you posers done been wack\nI hold it down like my boner in gym class\nAnd fuck Wayne! Man, I'm doper than his ass\nHim, Nicki, and Drake can get thrown over a cliff fast\nYou got cash? Big whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo!\nIf I had a knife right now, it would be stuck in you\nYo, you ain't gonna like this corner that you pushed me up into\n'Cause all you rap about's how you beat the pussy up and ooze\nFuck your fast car, your cheap singin'\nYou keep sayin' the same shit, while T-Painin'\nAnd we bangin' simply because it's all we hear\nMan, look at all these queers\nThe shit is so watered-down I developed soggy ears\nKill me! Shit, I'm waitin' to die, bitches\nI hate on all you rappers who made it, 'cause I didn't\nAnd I admit it, man, I ain't gon' bullshit y'all\nAs long as you walkin' away sayin' that fool spits raw\nYo, I'm from the West, I throw up the W and I stay hot\nBut still ain't mentioned\nWith Nipsey Hu$$le, Glasses, or Jay Rock\nWhat I gotta do, dig 'Pac up out of his grave spot\nAnd wear his face as a mask to my next show to create props?\nPeople always ask why do I sound mad\n'Cause I ain't got a girlfriend with a round ass\nAnd all my fuckin' dinners come in a brown bag\nHow sad! I need a crossroad to get found at\nMost rappers be in a six-four\nI prefer a big horse, lit torch, and a pitchfork\nWhile you out late workin' your shift when the kids snore\nI'm fuckin' your wife while the bitch snorts\nWearin' swim shorts\nI got a message on Facebook from some lame guy\nAnd he was like, \"Hopsin, dude! I fucking HATE life!\nI wanna rap, but I have stage fright, and I can barely write\nAnd I never make music that the babes like!\nAnd when I come home from school, I wait 'til late night\nAnd bump your music really super-loud\nAnd paint my face white\nFor real, bro, if you just help me, dude\nI swear to God, I'll do anything you tell me to!\"\nWhoa, don't hit me up tryna suck my dick!\n'Cause I'm a guy, and I would rather fuck five chicks\nWith some plump nice tits and the butt size thick\nSo I can hit the G-spot that only tough guys hit\nSo if you hear a rumor that I rape mics, it's true\nWhen I drop RAW, that will be the day I get sued\nDamon Elliot, I might as well just say bye to you\nFuck the industry! Go out and get Haywire too!"

You're so despicable\n'Cause your shit is boo-boo, your bars are predictable\nI do not bump it, it's hard to get into you\nPlease admit it, man, the voyage is radical\nMind is set to just destroy, I'm an animal\nKillin' shit, man, I'm a poisonous antidote\nI be on it, man, your boy's international\nYeah, I'm mad with rhymes\nBeen doin' this since '99, I'm a mastermind\nHomie, it's 2015, and all my niggas gon' kill it\nWhen they finish the job, the other half is mine\n\n[Refrain]\nFool, you ain't on that real shit\nI live here, you on a field trip\nI'm made of shit you ain't built with\nYou a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick\nIt's no doubt niggas gon' feel this\nYou don't scare niggas, not even a little bit\nI serve you, you get the bill quick\nCrown me, I'm a real prince\n\n[Hook]\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nGive me that shit!\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe rap game's mine, I revolve it round me\nI think I have lost it, and my mind's exhausted\nI'm nauseous from the process\nOf hoppin' on stage and tryin' to dive in moshpits\nNigga, why you focused on diamonds?\nThese Cubic Zirconia's all up in my ear\nOver jewelry, I don't get excited\nMy perception in life is \"Why the fuck am I here, nigga?\"\nI've been this way since your ass has been suckin' on titties\nSince niggas cocked back and start bustin' on 50\nSince J-Lo was mobbin' in public with Diddy\nSince Biggie and Pac got shot up, it's a pity\nThat bullshit you're talkin', I'm not in the mood, bro\nContinue yappin', you'll see Hopsin is brutal\nKeep pushin' me, you gon' get dropped with some Judo\nYou fannin' out like you want cock in yo' culo\nNiggas only in it for money and bitches\nI don't even think they wanna rap no more\nBut they wanna be all over the television\nRockin' feminine shit, tryin' to act homo\nOld bi-ass niggas can't bypass niggas\n\"I can't change even if I tried\"-ass niggas\nTight jeans on so they show yo' ass-ass niggas\nIn the pool with the homie, tryin' to splash-ass niggas\nFruity as Mike and Ike, you'll get diced to rice\nWhen I arrive I pull up like \"Hi! Surprise!\"\nIt might be wise to hide when the nightly skies are high\nFuckin' with an ape; no Life of Pi\nTell me, what position would the game be in\nWithout me havin' the ability to rape the pen?\nPound Syndrome, this is it, I'm weighin' in\nI still hate y'all niggas and I can't pretend\n\n[Refrain]\nFool, you ain't on that real shit\nI live here, you on a field trip\nI'm made of shit you ain't built with\nYou a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick\nIt's no doubt niggas gon' feel this\nYou don't scare niggas, not even a little bit\nI serve you, you get the bill quick\nCrown me, I'm a real prince\n\n[Hook]\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (Give it!)\nI said \"Give me that shit!\"\nGive me that crown boy! (C'mon!)\nGive me that shit!"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWho am I? Why am I even here, man?\nOkay, let's take a trip through my mind and see what we find. Yeah. Okay. Yo.\n\n[Verse]\nIn high school, Marcus wasn't a helpful student\nHe dropped out 'cause teachers would never help him through it\nAnd if I don't save this rap game who else would do it?\nThis is my motherfucking world, welcome to it\nIf you thinking that Hop's whack, then you is hating\nAnd what the fuck do my contacts have to do with Satan?\nI want a bitch with a bomb ass and some lubrication\nA loverboy, you see I'm that but I'm rude and blatant\nNow you listen here: I started a movement this year\nI will fuck you up if you interfere\nYou been a queer your whole fucking life and I'll kick you into gear\nYou trying to prove you a lunatic? Ooh, I'm oozing in fear!\nYou on some sloppy-clown bitch shit: I'll rip your head off\nPoke a stick through it, then beat the rest of your body down with it\nI start violence, cops come with the loud sirens\nNow I have to hop a barbed-wire fence\nThey find me in the broke down car I had been hiding in\nHomicide is now the charge I'm against\nWalk up to the jail cell with the guard I am with\nHe pushes me in and then the bar slides in\nThis new age of rappers, all they wanna do is floss, why?\nSwearing they're the boss guy, thinking that they're all fly\nYou, Lil' Wayne, Soulja Boy, this Asher Roth guy\nNormally I would mind, but this time I've lost mine\nWho the hell is he? The biggest hater that you'll ever meet\nWhite contacts, so you motherfuckers remember me\nLyrics put together so cleverly, you will never be\nOn my level, I chop all of you rappers to celery\nFake thugs rap like: \"I'll let the Glock spit at you\nJust got out the pen 'cause I move how real niggas move\"\nNo, don't lie, 'cause it hurts when you hear the truth\nYou got out the pen and wrote a verse with it, didn't you?\nFuck life, you can't tell me nothing\nI'll shove a knife in your back and leave it poking out through your belly-button\nSir, your daughter wasn't that reluctant\nYou see this 8-inch dick bulging out of my pants? Well, she sucked it\nI went to Wal-Mart with a Visa card, bought your wife a leotard\nAnd made her try it on to get my penis hard\nI'm pissed enough, I can never find a bitch to fuck\nI beat my dick a lot, that's why only my right wrist is buff\nI go dumb off of two packs of Now and Laters\nThen fight niggas like I was the black Power Ranger\nHead to the lake then wrestle a couple alligators\nThen run through the woods butt-naked; so what, pal? It's nature\nWhy the fuck would I collab witchu?\nYeah, you're good friends with Marcus but Hopsin don't wanna rap witchu!\nYou're full of shit like some ass-tissue\nAnd you're a bitch when you go to studios you bring your dad with you\nNo! Unacceptable, now watch me wreck a flow\nNiggas be hating 'cause I'm balling just like my testicles\nWord is bond, the way I'm on this mic and serving bombs\nI might as well have an Osama bin Laden turban on"

Are you only in my dreams?\nOnly when the moon is shining\nThat's when you are beside me\nGirl, I need you\nAnd that's real\nI don't wanna wake up\nI'll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI'm really hoping I find you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wake up in the morning with this sensational pain\nIt goes straight to the brain then my day is invaded with rain\nEngraved in my veins is your name, this ain't gonna change\nIt is staying remain unless my heart is deflated and drained\nYour love is magic\nDaydreaming about you is such a habit\nThought I saw you when I was driving\nBut I was stuck in traffic\nIf other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken\nI tell em' scram cause they need to know I'm happily taken\nYou see my love life, it wasn't going well till I found you\nFellas get jealous and doubtful when I tell em' about you\nI know we had our fair share in the past, with selfish lust\nBut once we came together we sealed it and nailed it shut\nYour touch is that of a goddess\nWhen we kiss, I'm at a lack of words\nEspecially when we pull away\nAnd then you smile afterwards\nIn our hearts, we're no different in color\nWe live for each other, I'm glad you're my significant other\nI love you\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you? Are you only in my dreams?\nOnly when the moon is shining\nThat's when you are beside me\nGirl, I need you\nAnd that's real\nI don't wanna wake up\nI'll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI'm really hoping I find you\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby it saddens me to know that you only exist in dreams\nI sit and fiend for you when I'm awake\nAnd it seems like I\u2019ll never be happy unless I sleep\nI failed to see the point in living without you\nIt got me thinking death is sweet\nI\u2019ll never know unless I leap, I guess I reach for the stars\nCause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately\nWhat I'm about to do I kept discrete\nI rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep\nTake me to ecstasy\nI tried to get you out my head, the pain's a lot worse\nI love you more than anything, I won\u2019t even put God first\nYou\u2019re the only reason that I sleep so often\nI'm hurting nights I don\u2019t see you\nI just keep on tossing and turning\nI feel so lost and deserted, you made my life good\nI told you if I had to take a bullet for you, I would\nSo baby here I go with the proof, this is it\nThe moment of truth, only for you *gunshot*\n\n[Bridge]\nWhere are you? Are you only in my dreams?\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI\u2019ll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI\u2019m really hoping to find you\n\n[Outro]\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up I\u2019ll stay asleep\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up I\u2019ll stay asleep"

Nah, that's where you guys are wrong\nI shit on niggas, that's why I rap with a diaper on\nDon't be approaching me with none of your mess\nTalking 'bout where I belong\nJust tell your friends all about me and sit\nAnd watch as they minds get blown\nNiggas on that basic shit, now I'ma go ape a bit\nI know y'all prayed for this, so don't trip\nHere's a handkerchief for your razored wrists\nMy flow got a few ways to switch\nNiggas act hard, I'ma change the script\nEverybody begging to be a buddy of mine\n'Cause they know I got skills y'all can't prevent\nWhen I lace a hit you impressive, none\nYou can take it as a lesson, son\nIf you was smart, you'd drop the mic and\nTry to stick up a bank with a weapon drawn\nPillow Man was slept upon\nThat's the reason the West was gone\nBut I set the bomb, when it blows up\nYou niggas will know where the heck I'm from\nI'm keeping it raw fo' sho', flow so diabolical\nYou all should know that it took like 10 whole years\nJust for my balls to grow\nNo overnight success, I'm struggling just to write this mess\nThe road to righteousness was more than words and skill that I possess\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI was the nigga all you niggas used to clown\nNow when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like \"Wow!\"\nYeah, how you like me now?\nI'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!\nAyo!

S-W-I-Z-Z and add another\nMy swagger makes your girl want to cut, like upper\nI'm mad hot, dog, my 16s should come with mustard\nIf you think I have a big head, then you haven't see my brother!\nStacked bad niggas swore I wouldn't make it rappin'\nPromised it couldn't happen and hated with a passion\nA mixtape later I silenced their laughing\nNow the same ones would probably suck my dick if I asked 'em\nIt's obvious I have it locked like CAPS\nRocking to a bitch fight beat that slaps\nI do it major, Poly Sci & Bio\nI don't have haters only fans in denial\nNow gimme a minute to hop in my zone, I'm making 'em pop like Mary\nI'm rocking the party to act all retarded, I'm making 'em pop like cherries\nI know this nigga is wild, but I will knock him down\nJust answer this question for me:\nHow you like me, how you like me now?\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI was the nigga all you niggas used to clown\nNow when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like \"Wow!\"\nYeah, how you like me now?\nI'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!\nAyo!

You wanna be pals?\nYou wanna be closest friends?\nSee a nigga so hot, that's why I'm popping up\nLike I'm toaster bread\nI say shit that don't get said\nThat's why I can't roll with feds\nIlluminati got they eye on me\nAnd they gon' see to it that a nigga don't get fed\nMy purpose ain't hard to see\nI pull up on rappers like \"pardon me\nYour bars are weak, you put too much time\nTryna get your sparkling charm to bling\"\nI be kickin' 'em multiple syllables\nRipping up shows and holding my genitals\nGet a dose of the wicked flow before your niggas run up\nSaying \"Homie, you should've known\"\nIt's crazy how life can switch\nI ain't gonna lie to you mine was shit\nNot anymore, shit changed up\nFrom woman selection to size of tits\nI know bitches who can ride the dick\nNiggas who think that my eyes are sick\nShowing 'em many agents who be loving\nThe melodies that I supply them with\nYo! I gotta a note for all y'all\nIn the rap game who got an album stacking dough\nY'all got big, chains'll start falling off like Michael Jackson's nose\nWho the illest? Y'all know\nHopsin, yeah, bravo\nI'm 'bout to leave the building right now\nAbadeAbade that's all folks\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI was the nigga all you niggas used to clown\nNow when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like \"Wow!\"\nYeah, how you like me now?\nI'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!\nAyo!

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI know I don't usually make love songs, but there's a few\nSpecial girls who kind of changed my perspective on everything\nAnd I feel like every guy comes to that point in his life\nWhere he changes from a boy into a man\nSo yo, this one is strictly for the ladies, only\n\n[Verse 1]\nSee when I met your stupid ass up at the mall on accident\nI thought you was the baddest chick I ever seen but that was so inaccurate\nYou stole my heart like you had done some magic trick\nYour essence was so fabulous you also had a sexy look and rack of tits\nI only had intentions to respect your ass and that was it\nI took you for a walk under the moon, we joked and laughed a bit\nThe chemistry was there, right where we met I had to act on it\nAt that moment I knew you was the girlfriend that I had to get\nWhat happened bitch? I swear you had me mad sprung\nOur first time hanging I could've did more than I had done\nBut I didn't because I was nervous, in my heart, you had reserved a place\nSo sexing you just wasn't on my mind cause you were worth the wait\nShit got to a point where you started cancelling dates we made\nGave me crazy rage, you had me thinking you hate me, great\nYou vanished with no signs and I didn't even know why\n'Til I found out you had a fucking boyfriend this whole time\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy couldn't you just tell me?\nYou had me buying plane tickets to go see your stupid ass\nThen you cancelled on me at the last minute talking about you busy\nBitch, I'm busier than you and I still make time for your bitch ass\nFuck you!\n\n[Hook]\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind\n\n[Verse 2]\nI swear I'm sick of this, bein' stuck in predicaments\nGettin' the shitty end of the stick and it's never different\nHours spent on the phone as I'm listenin' to your gibberish\nBlah-blah-blah your mind was scrambled I tried to configure it\nI'm not one you should move past, these player guys, you choose that\nTo me, you're worth a lot more than what they had valued you as\nOnly reason they hollered was because you got a cute ass\nThey just want you for sex and then they move on to a new task\nYour actions show your true class, I think you're moving too fast\nDatin' these strangers can be dangerous, they rarely do last\nBut you just too blinded to see, just like a disease\nThe guy that you been lookin' for is more than likely me\nBut now I'm on some \"fuck you\" type shit\nYour mind is so indecisive, bitch, cry\nI'll no longer be ya tissue you can wipe with\nYou just triflin', you get screwed so much\nI'm thinkin' that you like it, my prediction on\nYour future is always right, I must be psychic, damn\n\n[Bridge]\nSee, I ain't even tryna affiliate myself with stupid\nPeople like you anymore, it's the same damn story with\nYou every single time, don't be callin' me talkin 'bout\nYou fucked up, bitch, fuck you!\n\n[Hook]\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat's just the way that the story goes\nDeep down bitches ain't nothing but clueless, horny hoes\nThey'll fill ya life up with drama like it's the Maury show\nShe'll turn her back on you even though she had sworn she won't\nI never felt this sore before, here's what you do to be fair\nYou get a girl, fuck her while the opportunity is there, cause if you don't\nSome other nigga will, best believe this shit is real and\nWhen you find out what she's been doin' you'll fall and get the chills\nLove is just a battlefield, some bitches be gettin' killed\nNiggas too, it's the truth, better run and get your shield\nHoes will make ya think they at home waitin' for ya, sittin' still\nBut really, she's out with that guy you don't like and she's gettin' drilled\nMy heart is forever swollen, why'd I let you ever hold it?\nGirl, you was my Bella and I thought I was your Edward Cullen\nThere's no rules to hop onto your boat, you'll take whatever floats it\nBitch, you turned my heart into a cave no one should ever go in\n\n[Bridge]\nI can't stand these stupid bitches\nMan, I just wanna take my hand\nAnd put it around their fucking neck\nAnd choke the fuck outta them! Ooh!\nFuck 'em all!\n\n[Hook]\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind\nI should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)\nNow I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now\nBaby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you\nCause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys\nAnd good guys get left behind"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYo, I work hard and barely get paid\nHow did I get stuck on this page\nI've been starving for like six days\nI should go and get a switchblade\nAnd try to find out where this bitch stays\nI'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain\nSlit veins, squished brains I'm just saying\nLocked in the basement causes madness and errors\nAll I have to talk to is the fucking man in the mirror\nBut you never saw it from my perspective\nThe craft that I perfected got rejected\nAnd thrown out the window with no proper exit\nI was humble, now I'm not as pleasant\nI'm dropping wreckage on your shady dynasty, bitch I'am not to mess with\nYou made me think it was impossible that I could blow and get a little money from selling records for copping clothes\nLet's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold\nYou sleeping on a fucking pot of gold, so listen close\n\n[Hook]\nDon't you ever call me again\nI'm not your buddy\nI'm not your pal\nRight here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you\nI'm not your buddy\nI'm not your pal\nYou are my enemy\n\n[Pre-Verse]\nYo, hold on one second, I gotta see who's next on this real quick\nOh, this stupid-ass\nAlright\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, since when are buddies supposed to be so mean\nThere must be hate in the air that we both breathe\nShit we used to be tighter than emo jeans\nThe day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam\nI know you see me blowing up, growing up it disturbs you\nWhen my words move fanatics, and in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet\nTalking about I've been a wreck, my career is wack I'll never benefit\nI hope you die a bitter death\nThen lie in a graveyard in regret\nWhere all of the foul niggas rest\nYou hating 'cause you witnessing the best\nSo just confess\nYou shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess\nI'm not a bit impressed by nothing you've done\nMy name's stuck on your tongue\nMotherfucker you sprung\nGive it up, move on\nYou've taken this shit too far\nYou mad 'cause you unsatisfied with who you are, bitch\n\n[Hook]\nDon't you ever call me again\nI'm not your buddy\nI'm not your pal\nRight here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you\nI'm not your buddy\nI'm not your pal\nYou are my enemy\n\n[Pre-Verse 2]\nAlright, lets see who else we got on this shit\nMorgan\nAlright, yo\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou were the love I used to see in my dreams\nBut when we met, how come shit can never be what it seem\nI was pleased with the things we did together\nIt's like we was a team\nBut you would change when I flee from the scene\nAround me you were pure hearted, loving and caring\nAnd when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance\nYou fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare at\nBut you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it\nBecause you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do\nDrugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true\nYou saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through\nHoes are just so rude, fucking bogus and cold too\nOh but there's no dude you would let interfere\nWith our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear\nWhen you arrived in my world, I thought Heaven was near\nBut time made it very clear that the devil was here\nSo fuck you\n\n[Hook]\nDon't you ever call me again\nI'm not your buddy\nI'm not your pal\nRight here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you\nI'm not your buddy\nI'm not your pal\nYou are my enemy"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nHello Hopsin\nWord on the streets is that you're crazy\nAnd I honestly believe you are\n\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nListen, if I was really crazy I'd run up inside an orphanage\nAnd torment kids, and beat babies faces with bags of oranges\nFake my origin and tell people that I was born to sin\nI'd go back to filming molested porn again (Yeahhh)\nI would murder a nigga then steal his body from whatever morgue it's in\nAnd take it back to an alley to torture it\nStudy all of the Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and Chuckie horror flicks\n(Baby is that a knife that you have in your hand?) Of course it is!\nI'd run around crazy like the Afghans do in some black camp boots wearin' a fuckin' Batman suit\nAnd scream at bitches like I'm Fatman Scoop (C'MERE!)\nAnd tell them to take a deep breath cause this will be their last chance to\nI'd hate on everyone who's sane and gifted (Yup)\nThen claim that my brain is missing while sniffing cocaine\nAnd then cut my dick for the Pain Olympics\nIf I was crazy I would go pick up the mic and use it\nAnd tell Dwayne Carter that I really like his music (Shit)\n\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Cryptic Wisdom]\nIf I was manic I probably woulda neglected my responsibilities and made society respect it\nI'd walk around in a dress with a can of gas\nAnd blow up a mothafucka for laughing with half a match\nDig up all the baby cadavers and grab a basket\nAnd shoot them through every window of every crib that I'm passing\nI'd probably be back a couple hours later to fuck 'em with every bottle\nI cut up within my labor\nTake a breather, make a haste of it and bounce\nToward the house it's adjacent of and chase everyone out\nAnd take em down\nTell them I'm the devil and I'm claiming everybody for a battle that's crazier than my brain is\nGrab a chainsaw, blow the fuckin' dust back\nLeave it all and still ready me a new blood bath\nRun back to the psyche ward\nCheck my perimeter and get in before they knew that I left\n\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy\n\n[Verse 3: SwizZz]\nYo, I won't lie, I'm not as crazy as glue\nBut if I was let me describe all the bullshit I would do\nI'd jack off with sandpaper while I'm watching the View\nPicturing Whoopi bald headed stroking cock with her boobs!\nI'll throw babies in dryers\nStrangle tweakers that fidgit\nContract HIV willfully, just to purposely give it\nI'd mug mothers on wellfare\nSwim in gallons of gas\nMeander to the batting cage and use my dick for a bat! (SHIT!)\nIf I was derranged, I'd cop me a chain\nMake it rain like Washington and throw a stripper some change\nMake her work it on the floor, pussy pop on a handstand\nLick her dirty snatch and film it all on my webcam (Oh yeah!)\nHonestly I'd be itching for gunplay\nI'll cock the .45 and shoot up church on a Sunday\nI'll hi-jack a plane while it's still on the runway\nGrope the stewardess and take the passengers' chump change!\n\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy"

Niggas better duck and run for cover like it's fuckin' Iraq\n(Stand down, nigga!)\nI'm pouring liquor for your ass, you ain't even die yet (Oh no!)\nI've been headin' up the ladder long enough\nIt's time I hit the climax (Yikes!)\nYour career's goin' bye-bye, it's ironic you don't got a bypass\nNiggas know that I've been ill\nMan, the whole time that I've been here\nI done made a fortune like ten mil'\nFrom the paper lines that my pen fills\nAnd if I don't spend it, my kids will\nI'm low-key but a big deal\nHoes see me and they freeze up, that's why they all on my dick still\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey tell me I'm too hostile, I am Picasso\nBitches like, \"Remember me from high school?\" Nah, ho\nCame up in this shit killin' niggas with the hot flow\nY'all ain't got a fuckin' thing on Hop, whoa\n\n[Chorus]\nBoy, you better rock slow\nWho am I? I'm Picasso\nTake the high road\nASAP 'cause I ain't liable\nFor no nigga (Nope!)\nMy fuckin' head is in the cosmos\nGot it locked though\nBitch, I'm Pablo Picasso (Mhm)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been told the new game plan's\nTo make bullshit for the new age fans\nAnd you can't pop unless you take Xans\nAnd flex on the 'Gram like you do make bands\nWhat? Oh no, they like, \"Fuck boom bap rap, you can't win\"\n\"Save that shit for the Wu-Tang Clan\"\nThat's when I bust in like the Kool-Aid Man (Yeah!)\nLook, I ain't the nigga who pullin' up\nTryna get shine by how much the Rollie glow (Nah)\nI'm here to rain on parades\nMy sinister ways to fuck up the rodeo (Woo!)\nI do my shows and hoes\nBe losin' control like I was the Holy Ghost (Stop!)\nWhen I deliver the penis it lies in the mouth, she call it Pinocchio\nMmm, man, who want war with me?\nBitch, I torture beats, I've been born to beast\nStill I abort MC's, oh so horribly\nDog, your corpse'll be right on the floor with these\nFeet that I'll stomp you out with\nThis my house, bitch, and you can't afford the lease (Watch out!)\n(Whoa) Fuck all that Hollywood shit\nOver half of you not even lit that be ridin' my dick\nI got no problem with this\nI come through and your body is zipped, I could hardly resist\nNigga, my hobby is pissin' on anyone I can offend\nI got no friends\nWhoever thinkin' they hot, go and tell 'em nobody's convinced, hmm\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey tell me I'm too hostile, I am Picasso\nBitches like, \"Remember me from high school?\" Nah, ho\nCame up in this shit killin' niggas with the hot flow\nY'all ain't got a fuckin' thing on Hop, whoa\n\n[Chorus]\nBoy, you better rock slow\nWho am I?

At the time I never thought you was it\nI do now but shit you're gone, so I just offer you this\nA song to you, through it I open the crack in my chest\nAnd show the whole world I've always had a lack of respect\nFor women who enter my life, I look to vengeance as knife\nIntentions to fight, if you thinking I was senseless you right\nNow every sentence I write, I think twice on it so I don't regret\n'Cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness\nI'm an unholy mess, put me in a hole to rest\nWelcome to my life this is how painful my stories get\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nShe said, \"You never loved me, you just controlled me\nIf you fuck around I'm calling the police\"\nBut all I wanted to say was I'm sorry\nOh, how I wish that could tell you\n\n[Hook]\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow use this track as a lesson\nAll you guys out there who have some aggression\nTowards your woman it don't have to get hectic\nThat crap is pathetic, now look at me I have to regret it\nI can't go near her or nothing, she'll probably have me arrested\nThe only thing I could do is just make a track with a message\nAnd hope she hears it so she could know I was badly affected\nI never meant to be that type of guy\nBut I realized that I was, and because of it I'm throwing my sinister life aside\nI can cry at any moment just thinking about it\nSometimes I hide it from the folks that I'm hanging around with\nI should apply for a new soul 'cause I think it's invalid\nSomebody told me when I die I'll be safe but I doubt it\nThe grudge she holds against me, it hurts me so severely\nShe won't come near me, I thought that time was supposed to cure me\nI'm so alone and weary, writing songs to heal me\nI swear that I'm sorry Heather, I mean it so sincerely\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nShe said, \"You never loved me, you just controlled me\nIf you fuck around I'm calling the police\"\nBut all I wanted to say was I'm sorry\nOh, how I wish that could tell you\n\n[Hook]\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you"

It's been five hours, man, what's goi\u2014\n\u2014 Yeaaah, shut your fuckin' mouth, ya fuckwit, before I fuckin' bash ya!\n\u2014 Man, what the fuck are you talkin'\u2014\n\u2014 Go inside, ya fuckin' wombat!\n\u2014 Man, this is stupid.\n\u2014 Go on, sit down!\n\u2014 *sighs* Oh, god.\n\u2014 Now, your missus claims you assaulted her.\n\u2014 Psssssst.\n\u2014 Bloody oath, man, why'd ya fuckin' beat her?\n\u2014 Man, I didn't fucking beat her! Listen, I'm telling you\u2026\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nI got her the engagement ring that she liked, booked a new flight\nTo come to Sydney, just to see her, start a new life\nMan, she's 20 weeks pregnant and I was tryin' do right\nFor us, the family, the kid, but maybe I was too nice\nMy homie text me a picture and I just burst into anger\nIt was my girl in a bed with her personal trainer\nI text my homie like, \"Yo, where you find this?\"\nHe says, \"Snapchat, bro, it's all on my timeline, shit.\"\nSwear it struck a fuckin' nerve in my chest\nI looked at my girl and said, \"Get a paternity test!\"\nShe said, \"NO! Don't you get all worked and upset\nI only slept in his bed right after work just to rest.\"\nI said, \"What? You expect me to believe that?\nHa, alright, yeah I'll 'relax'\nGuess it doesn't seem bad\nMy girlfriend's with a buff nigga gettin' t-bagged.\"\nOfficer, correct me if I'm wrong but she needed her head detached\nI said, \"Bitch, I can't believe this shit!\nDoes he know you're pregnant? Is that his kid?\nLook how big my headache is!\nThis whole time y'all havin' sex and shit\nWhat type of nigga would fuck a pregnant chick?!\nI said, \"Let's get this paternity test, I'm not kiddin', bitch!\"\nShe said, \"No, I'm not gettin' it!\"\nOfficer, I ain't seen her in months, I couldn't trust the lyin' whore\nPlus she told me she slept with this guy before\nAnd then I said, you know what? Forget it, it's all good, nevermind\nShit was makin' my blood pressure high\nI love her unconditionally, you know, I can't pretend I ain't never lie\nFor the moment, I guess I'll let her slide\nShe said, \"If you don't want to take care of this kid, Marcus, then say so.\"\nI said, \"Wait, no, it's mine too, I can't go\nHow you gonna support this kid without me? You don't make dough.\"\nShe said, \"Hahaha. I make loads.\"\nShe had six grand cash\nI said, \"But you was broke two weeks ago!\nHow you makin' chips that fast?\"\nShe said, \"I bartend, I made it all in tips, ha ha.\"\nI said, \"Girl, you must take me as a big jackass.\"\nI'm like, \"Please, we both know money is hard to come by.\"\nHer bullshit might fly over the heads of some guys\nOfficer, she's always tellin' dumb lies\nI've known her for six years, and she hasn't lifted a finger one time!\nI said, \"Where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe said, \"I bartend, duhhh, from tips. I'm a waitress.\"\nI said, \"Where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe started stutterin' like, \"Uhm-uhh-mmm, Marcus, wait just\u2014\"\nI said, \"Where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe said, \"Ok, ok, I'll tell you, just promise me you won't get mad.\"\nI'm like, \"Baby, where'd you get the cash from?\"\nShe said, \"I work at a strip club\u2026 it's how I made the six grand.\"\nI said, \"Woaah, no\u2026 NOOO!\"\nI fell down in tears, my heart broke, I turned cold\nI don't want the girl that I'm in love with doin' ho shit\nIf she needed cash I woulda loaned it, and she knows it\nThey won't let me get a refund on this $20,000 ring\nFuck, my head, it hurts, I need some ibuprofen\n[Interlude: Hopsin & Police Officer]\n\u2014 Yeah, Mr. Hopson, you need a minute?\n\u2014 Um, may I have some water please?\n\u2014 Ah, no worries at all.\n\u2014 I don't mean to cry and get emotional, but all this just bothers me.\n\u2014 Yeah, it's alright, you're good\u2026 yeah here ya go, mate!\n\u2014 Thanks\u2026 *sips water*\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nI wasn't me no more\nI looked her in the eyes and straight told her\n(What'd you say to her?)\nI need you to tell me where this strip club is at\nOr this family we're about to have is over\nI said, \"Tell me where it's at!\" \u2014 she said, \"No.\"\nI said, \"You about to make me mad!\" \u2014 she said, \"So?\"\nI said, \"Bitch, you better panic and run, the damage is done\nYou're doin' this four months away from havin' my son! UGHN!\"\nI told her I would always have her back\nI forgave her after all the careless acts\nI have one question, and she couldn't share the facts\nThe strip club \u2014 how come she couldn't tell me where it's at?\nWho the fuck she fuckin' in there?\nWhose dick she suckin' in there?\nShakin' her fuckin' butt in the air\nIt's like we've argued for a thousand fuckin' hours, I'm annoyed\nAnd I was at the point where somethin' was 'bout to get destroyed\nI grabbed her purse, threw that shit across the room\nI fuckin' launched it too\nIt was filled with makeup kits and all of her jewels\nI blacked out; she said, \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\"\nShe got up out the bed to get it, I pushed her ass back in it\nI said, \"We're still talkin', bitch, you and I ain't finished\nNow, this strip club, where is it? BITCH, WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?!\"\nI said, \"You know what? Fuck it. Awesome. Fine.\"\nIn the process of all this drama, I had lost my mind\nI felt lost and blind: the gym trainer, the strip club\nThe ring, the baby, she really crossed the line\nAnd then I finally came down and all the madness was finished\nThen she invited me to dinner with her family in Penrith\nI said, \"I ain't goin' with you, you can leave now\nI need to stay in this hotel room and figure some things out.\"\nOfficer, I know you ain't gonna sympathize\nI don't approve of any man puttin' hands on his girlfriend or wife\nEspecially when she's pregnant with his kid inside\nHonestly feel like I wasn't in the wrong, but still I wasn't in the right\nAsk her, she ain't got no bruises on her\nI'm human, there's only so much that a dude can conquer\nShe knew that her actions reflected true dishonor\nAnd tried to cover it, sayin' I'm an abusive monster\nThat's bullshit, huh, and that fast, poof\nAll of her wrongs are in the past, cool\nShe's just the innocent white girl\nAnd I'm the black guy who always gets mad, true!\nI know y'all about to make it hard for me to get back into Australia\nMan, this shit is fuckin' sad, dude\nI still don't know if this baby is mine or not\nSo when he's born, who's gonna be the fuckin' dad? You?"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI know this is super random\nWe done had our ups and downs and I done threw some tantrums\nI honestly care about you way more than you could fathom\nAnd God knows I ain't lyin\u2019, if only you could ask Him\nI know you think our happiness just comes and goes in occasions\nWhen I leave Earth, I wanna be frozen in place\nWith a rose in a case full of love notes I wrote for the days I got to be next to you\nThat's how I feel and no one can change it, but\nI gotta get this tension off of my chest\n'Cause every day I feel a constant regret\nNow I can reflect to see the issues we never dissolved or suppressed\nI guess it\u2019s only right that karma was next\nAnd I'ma be open and honest with you, your absence is causing the stress\nI wish the pain I feel would lay inside a coffin and rest\nAnd it's only you who can soften my flesh\nBut still you run me in circles and lately you ain't been responding to texts\nAnd now my only option is to act like I don't fucking need you\nI bottle up the pain although the bottle's fucking see-through\nI pray to God and wish that we could wash it up and re-do\nGuess every love story just ain't got a fucking sequel\nI just need to know if you feel the same\nWhy can't we kill the games and reconcile?\nI know you still afraid, we both stuck\nThere\u2019s no trust, we gave our souls up the moment love had approached us, but\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nCan we go back to the old us?\n\u2019Cause I just don't fuck with this new you\nLately you ain\u2019t showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n'Cause I just don\u2019t fuck with this new you\nLately you ain't showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n\n[Verse 2]\nOn my end there was mistakes made, I had too much pride to take blame\nThe moment my fame came, my ways changed\nI couldn't stay sane and started making our sunny days rain\nAnd even though my life has moved on, our history's too strong to forget\nI won't pretend I ain't stained\nAnd if you open up my fucking chest and take a look in my heart\nI swear to God you gon' see yo' engraved name\nHow you gon' leave me hanging?\nHow you gon' leave me achin'?\nI never did get my closure, so how you gon' mediate it?\nHow you gon' be when Zade is old enough to understand that his daddy isn't around?\nHow we gon' be related?\nAnd I just want my family on track, that's the plan we both had\nShit is sad because I'm askin' for a chance we don't have\nI fucking love you\nAnd I just had to grab my notepad just to write a song for you saying\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nCan we go back to the old us?\n'Cause I just don't fuck with this new you\nLately you ain't showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n'Cause I just don't fuck with this new you\nLately you ain't showin' no love\nYou act like I never knew you\nWe need to stop the games right now\nLet's stop the games, baby\nI need you to ease the pain right now\nI need you to keep it real with me, my love\nCan we go back to the old us?\n\n[Outro]\nI'm sorry"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBaby, I know we goin' through shit and you feel like there ain't no solution\nYou say I'm a nuisance and think I be playin' these games with your heart and not purposely bruise it\nThat's when I lose it and flip, put the blame all on you like it's all your fault\nNow I'm goin' through your phone, you goin' through mine, and we wrestlin', I'm hopin' you don't call no cops\nBaby, I love you, don't be jealous of females I know that I've met down the way\nYou mention they name on a regular basis and you just be givin' the space in my brain\nYou'll look me straight in the face, swear that I'm stickin' my penis up in every girl that I'm friends with\nAnd that's the moment I say, \"I don't even know why I'm in a relationship, I want to end it\"\nLet's just chill the fuck out, girl, we livin' in the same damn house\nEverywhere I go, you go, and you go, I go, so what we naggin' about?\nShit, not a goddamn thing, maybe we just like to hear ourselves talkin'\nWe do it way too often, I think we both lost it\nOur love just might be in the coffin, oh shit\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI feel like your parents don't like me, I hate that you tell 'em our problems\nSee, when I first met 'em I knew that they fell in love with me, but then I fell straight to the bottom\nNow your daddy textin' me sayin' to fly you home and he bein' so passive aggressive\nThen I'm like \"Sure you gon' pay for her ticket?\" That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'\nI've been sufferin' from manic depression, baby it takes a real man to confess it\nI don't care if you confront me with issues you got, just be careful with how you address it\n'Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way\nThen all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain, and I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay\nBut don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better, you been the only focus since the day we met up\nEvery time we get into it, you got me wishin' that I never broke up with my girlfriend back in Maryada\nYou say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do\n'Cause I don't want nobody else but you\nI know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me\nSo baby let's get it right because fightin' doesn't help the bruise, we both lose\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy do we fight so often?\nThese games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us\nWe just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it\nAnd if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient\n\n[Verse 3]\n'Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'\nAnd I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'\nIt's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up\nAnd I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once\nMan, this shit be frustratin' me\nIf you ain't the one then who may it be?\nWe tried to make love, but we made a beast\nNow we just stuck 'cause we can't agree\nThis is my heart, please take a piece\nAnd put it in a safe place to remind you\nThere's a million other guys in the world to choose\nBut none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nYeah, early 2014 I was on the Knock Madness tour\nI was mad about it, I half-assed my album 'cause I really didn't know what I was rapping for\nI was going through a break up and that was hard\nI wasn't in my right mind, nigga that's for sure\nEvery night I was praying and I would ask the Lord\nTo please give me strength, so I don't slam the door on my fans\nBut no luck I was stuck\nEven though a nigga had a plus size buzz\nI didn't even know who the fuck I was\nI tried so hard to see a plus side, but\nI couldn't find the spark inside the dark\nEven with my crew saying nice remarks\nIt felt like some darts were stuck inside my heart\nI was thinking that a brand new life's the start\nBut I couldn't leave, I made a commitment\nOn my off time the fans invaded my business\nSo I started feeling a gang of resentment\nFlipping on everybody when they ain't even did shit\nI needed to go home and gather my thoughts\nI didn't wanna suicide as the result\nSo the night at my Fort Collins show before I hit the stage\nI left through the back for a walk and no one saw\nI thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or somethin'\nAnd a voice had told me to keep walking\nAnd do not step foot on that stage for nothing\nSo I kept on walking\nThen I camped out up in an abandoned house\nI hated this rap shit and I hated my life\nThe spotlight does that when you can't get out\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\n'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low\nWon't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know\nI might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat\nAnd I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry\nFort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry\nFort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry\n(Money and the fame)\n(Money and the fame)\nIt just doesn't feel so right lately\n(Money and the fame)\nDon't know where I'm going tonight baby\n(Money and the fame)\nIt just doesn't feel so right\nDon't know where I'm going tonight\nSomeone guide me to the light, please\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nI got a girl back home, yeah\nGod know she the sweetest thing on earth\nI can't sleep on her\nBut there's too many women on tour and I try not to cheat on her\nMan, my options for pussy are unrealistic\nThere's bitches who'd give up a lung for this dick\nMy music be leaving 'em sprung and twisted\nThe average nigga would have fun with this shit, that's real\nHere is a secret, you don't have to keep it between you and I\nUpcoming rappers who 'bout to be touring, I promise the road will eat you alive\n\n[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]\nBut you know that shit when you rise\nAnd by no surprise, I'm not gon' feed into the lies\nNo, I'm not gon' say that you wrong\nBut I'm not gon' say that you right, it's hard to keep quiet\nWhen all I do is hold you down\nIf I ain't know you then, well I feel like I know you now\nI know you had a little doubt, but to hop off stage and find out\nYou done walked out, and you not taking nobody calls\nYou don't wanna deal with it\nBut I'm looking at these fans like 'damn, there's a lot of y'all'\nYou got me tripping with the bodyguard\nLike \"Nigga, how the fuck you lose the headliner?\"\nNow I don't care that you left the show\nI just wish you woulda let me know\n'Cause I don't know if you've been kidnapped\nOr know somebody from the city where they live at\nBut, the way you went about it make it hard for me to feel bad\nHonestly it made a nigga real mad\n'Cause I'm texting you like, \"Hop the devil just testing you\nAnd Fort Collins got respect for you\"\nAnd that's why the next day, you was like\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\n'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low\nWon't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know\nI might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat\nAnd I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry\nFort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry\nFort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry\n(Money and the fame)\n(Money and the fame)\nIt just doesn't feel so right lately\n(Money and the fame)\nDon't know where I'm going tonight baby\n(Money and the fame)\nIt just doesn't feel so right\nDon't know where I'm going tonight\nSomeone guide me to the light, please"

Then come and get some\nI'm takin' the cake, and all that's left for y'all is the pieces I bit from\nSee I ain't buddy-buddy with rappers because that shit is fake\nMost of y'all morals is fucked up, you on a different page\nYou get no props just 'cause you getting paid\nIf you garbage we ain't doing business, point blank, I discriminate\nAnd I don't do no bullshit collabs to get my name poppin'\nThat ain't even considered a safe option\nAnd that just ain't Hopsin, I paid homage, now I'm straight wilin'\nNow turn this shit up while the bass knockin', now c'mon\n\n[Chorus]\nThe fiends are knocking at my door\nShould I give them what they're asking for?\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness\nSo what the fuck y'all need from me?\nI'm here to make these fiends believe\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), gotta have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I be gettin' comments like\n\"Hop, what's the hold up with your new shit, man?, you be taking forever son\nYo I'ma stop waiting, I'm getting my hopes up\nWith your work ethic it ain't gon' ever come\nYou had the XXL cover in 2012\nAnd I thought you would soon prevail, but homie, you ain't doing well\nYou hit us with that Ill Mind shit and that was cool as hell\nBut when it comes to your album, you never got no news to tell\nYour whole career is just a train wreck\nYou toured around the world for 3 years, but you always performed the same set\nI been asked you to come to my city, but you ain't came yet\nI guess you ain't in it for love, you just want that pay check\nIf I was you, then I wouldn't be too proud\nYou signed Dizzy not too long ago and he's bigger than you now\nYou said you saving hip-hop, well, save this shit\nAnd all I hear is wack niggas and I hate this shit\nHomie I stopped being a scrub because of you\nI stopped playin' these bitches in the club and fell in love because of you\nMy dad heard your song and he stopped doin' drugs because of you\nI learned to rap and even built a little buzz because of you\nBut you take it for granted, thinking you have it made\nSittin' back in the shade, Hopsin, there's people that you have to save\nThis is beyond music\nYou speak life into these motherfuckers, Hop, you have a gift, so when you gon' use it?\"\nDamn, I have that much of an impact?\nMy rhymes did that? Sometimes, I really feel my shit's wack\nThat's why I kick back, but fuck this shit, yo, where my pen at?\nI'm 'bout to kill this shit and make niggas just wanna quit rap\nI'm causing havoc, layin' the rappers like a hammock\nIf I want the fucking planet, I can have it, now try to snatch it\nOnly God can stop my violent habits\nYou niggas average, I ain't even in my prime and still I'm twice the savage\nC'mon\n\n[Chorus]\nThe fiends are knocking at my door\nShould I give them what they're asking for?\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness\nSo what the fuck y'all need from me?\nI'm here to make these fiends believe\nThey want it (want it)\nNeed it (need it), gotta have it (have it)\nWoah\u2014oh (woah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nKnock Madness"

Where is it at?\nI haven't seen it, who dares to attack a genius?\nYou'll get managed I'll have you gag your penis\nUntil you throw up your own liver (nuts)\nI don't give a (fuck), the flow ripper (what)\n\n[Hook]\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow if I stop being who I am, that would upset me\nI'll never change for none of your wack-ass deadbeats\nI struggled to change for J.

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHis name is Jesse, we kicked it since we was little kids\nThroughout his life there's a bunch of stuff that he shouldn't have did\nHe was cool but there's a lot of stuff he could have fixed\nBut addicted to drugs is what I had thought he couldn't get\nUntil he had started hanging around them other kids\nWho showed him how to drink a Corona and puff a cig\nAnd introduced him to weed with added supplements\nSo whenever he was feeling down he'd take a couple hits\nIt ain't really bother me cause it was nothing big yo\nIt only bothered me when he started to fuck with crystal\nI'm sure he knew that doing it wasn't a smart move\nHe'd walk around with humongous pupils like cartoons\nI tried to tell him his life goals'll be ruined\nBut he just told me to \"chill out\", he knows what he's doing\nAnd now I'm thinking hard if I should get hostile\nAnd said fuck it\nAnd watched him take it right up his nostril\n\n[Hook]\nExcuse me do you need a ride\nLooks like you're going downtown\nYes, hop in my ride\nWell hi I'm Chris Dolmeth\nChris Dolmeth\nHi I'm Chris Dolmeth\nChris Dolmeth, come ride with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nEleventh grade where he's supposed to be\nBut he's in the ninth\nHe'd wake up for school feeling like it's the end of life\nHe'd hop off his bunk bed to go and sniff a line\nA couple minutes later, now he's energized\nHe'd go to school and wide open's how he'd get his eyelids\nThen he'd get excited\nCause he finished his assignments\nNow it's big surprises from the teachers when they find it\nJessy's doing all his work\nWell shit aight then\nI guess it wasn't that bad after all that he did meth\nIt made him actually do his work, and not cheat on tests\nIt boosted up his confidence, he felt like he's the best\nHe'd stay up all fucking night like he don't need to rest\nUntil he had none left\nNow he's acting strange\nHe couldn't buy anymore, cause he didn't have the change\nSo he sold his Xbox and his whole rack of games\nI never thought that the crystal could make him act this way\n\n[Hook]\nExcuse me do you need a ride\nLooks like you're going downtown\nYes, hop in my ride\nWell hi I'm Chris Dolmeth\nChris Dolmeth\nHi I'm Chris Dolmeth\nChris Dolmeth, come ride with me\n\n[Verse 3]\nJesse's sister walked inside of his room to get something out\nThen she noticed Jessy on the bed foaming from his mouth\nNow she's tearing up, scared as fuck\nOh he's done it now\nSo she picks up the phone gives 911 a dial\nShe tried to give him CPR, before the kid was lost\nThen he had woke up and saw her on him and it pissed him off\nAll of sudden he went crazy just to fucking get her off\nHe threw her up against the wall so hard it made a picture fall\nHe can't really get a grip\nShe can't believe he did this shit\nShe kinda knew what made him flip\nShe yelled, it's drugs isn't it\nAnd now the paramedics at the door\nSo she runs down to open it and they run up with all these antidotes\nThey tried to tackle him but he's too hard to handle though\nThey called for back-up\nSo the station sent another van to go\nWhen they arrived he was spitting in their face and eyes\nSo they injected him until he had a stable mind\nThey told his sister that it's time for them to take a ride\nYou lucky that your brother made it\nCause he almost died\nShe went up to say bye but he must have dozed off\nAnd I had barely pulled up when the truck drove off\nFrom our apartment buildings, so I didn't see crap\nAnd I ain't get to see him till he got out of rehab\nEven when he got out he was still depressed\nUntil he heard a little tiny voice in his head that said\n\n[Hook]\nExcuse me do you need a ride\nLooks like you're going downtown\nYes, hop in my ride\nWell hi I'm Chris Dolmeth\nChris Dolmeth\nHi I'm Chris Dolmeth\nChris Dolmeth, come ride with me"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThis'll probably be the last song that I come out with for a while\nI'm sorry to all my fans\n\n[Verse 1]\nI always think of Robin Williams, someone we loved and who we saw appealing\nHe made us all laugh as adults and children\nShit, all the millions that he had, I wonder what were his thoughts and feelings\nFive minutes before the belt had cut his breath off and killed him\nProlly something like my thoughts now\nWhat goes up has gotta fall down\nI guess I'll pour it all out 'cause right now, the reaper's in the room visiting\nSo if I do leave, at least you'll know why I did it then\nIt started way back then when I was a kid at first\nNiggas bullied me when they saw that I was an introvert\nI was never cool, had no friends, no chicks would flirt\nEvery school year it's like all my issues were getting worse\nMy whole life they was calling me corny; stupid\nI never had a dad who was there to mentor me through it\nSkateboarding was my escape, it wasn't just for amusement\nMy issues kept reoccurring so I would resort to music\nI'd vent about the burdens that were sitting in my heart\nI'd vent about the way I fell from swimming with the sharks\nMy mom was always working, so our bond was stripped and ripped apart\nAin't no fucking family memories, ain't no pictures at the park\nThen I thought, \"The world is about to see Hell come\nAnd I'ma live the good life everyone else wants\"\nAnd in that moment my tears dried and I felt numb\nThen years later I blew up, the mission was well done\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\n\n[Verse 2]\nFinally I was famous, people kissing my ass\nI knew that I was only here 'cause it's revenge from my past (It's crazy)\nWent from a loser in school who got the worst grades\nTo being praised for all my verses when I dispersed rage\nI copped a whip, moved out the ghetto like, \"Bye, haters\"\nBought a brand new house with a bunch of white neighbors\nEveryone started calling wanting like five favors\nAnd guess what? All of it dealt with spending my paper\nAnd I was nice, I'd give 'em cash, I'd show sympathy\nI gave him some, him, and her, I'm just lending cheese\nNow I'm just looked at like an ATM machine\nIf I don't give my friends my money, shit, I'm the enemy\nI had about a million new best friends that I just met\nSome were plotting to build me a death bed\nAll because they kept on putting wack songs out that no one's impressed with\nSo out of jealousy they'd diss me, you fucking guessed it (Ha)\nAt least I had my squad; Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz\nI knew we'd stick together, stuck in this chaotic biz\nWe had it all figured out and had a lot to give\nIt was Funk Volume for life, who want a problem, bitch?\nThen all the sudden, out of nowhere we parted ways\n2016 \u2013 those were some of my darkest days\nAsk us all, \"Whose fault was it?\" Ain't hard to say\nBut it was due to money and all of our bonds had started to fade\nMonths later, my girl told me she's pregnant\nThis was something I never expected\nHer and I weren't on good terms at the time, man, it was hectic\nAnd I was scared if she kept this baby I might regret it\nMainly because her and I had a fucking toxic relationship\nLast thing we need is a fucking toddler to raise in it\nHaving a baby is great, but not as amazing when you got two parents who always fighting, hollering, breaking shit\nPresent day, all my people are gone\nNo real friends, just leeches around eating the crumbs\nNo family bonds, no FV, can't be with my son\nNo fucking girlfriend, I swear I thought that she was the one\nI feel alone and I struggle to get my fans what they want from me\nI'm struggling to build this UP company\nI'm begging on my fucking knees like, \"God, please help me 'cause I can't fucking breathe\nI'm tryna smile, but pain is cutting deep\nShow me that I'm more than just a rapper\nShow me that this life that I've been working on is meant to be more than just a disaster\"\nI hope this message I'm sending is floating up above\nInstead of focusing on fame, I should've focused on the love\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\n\n[Outro]\nI gotta go find myself\nI hope you all can understand"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nUh, Hopsin, yo, check it\n\n[Verse]\nI've come to conclusion that life sucks\nThe only good that comes out of it is sticking my dick in nice butts\nSo if it's wetter than normal inside your wife's cunt\nIt\u2019s my nut, I busted inside her that hasn\u2019t dried up (Yuck!)\nI'm such a contradiction, I hang with Dizzy Wright\nAnd all he does is smoke so when I'm breathing all the ganja gets in\nNot to mention I'm condescending, my mind is missing\nPlus I'm kinda sending the wrong signal, oh god, I'm sickening\nI'm not the one you wanna start shit with\nI'm part animal, part dimwit with bad manners like Bart Simpson\nYou Hollywood niggas who write songs\nI'll give you a black eye, that's a good reason to put some ice on\nI'm like a Jedi with the Obi-Wan bars\nLyrics are shocking just like a phoney gun charge\nMy niggas we only fuck with the dopey blonde broads\nWe play 'em, and trade 'em like they were Pokemon cards\nI excel in rap, it's 'cause I been through fucking hell and back\nYou ain't close to dope, it's just that everybody else is wack\nNiggas getting jealous tryna diss me, scary!\nI'm an animal, fuck a Mink coat, bitch wear me!\nYo, all you rappers quit your bitching and sit and listen\nI'm the new sick edition of Pac, this is the demolition\nI'm so tired of all the reminiscing\nSo I'ma leave these niggas shook like my dick when I finish pissing\n(Yo, you fucking nasty dog) Get off me\nI love Christ, but guarantee you wouldn't wanna cross me\nI'm as frustrating as lost keys\nMy sick mind's a good example of what the crooked law breeds\nI'm trying to die as the greatest rapper\nShit, I'm so hungry I could stick my fist in a blender and drink it after\nYou climbing up then I'ma break the ladder\nAnd you'll fall off so damn hard that every bone in your face will shatter\nFuck these niggas, I'm a racist bastard\nYou hear the devil speaking in tongues on this song if you replay it backwards\nTell your sister I can't wait to smash her\nBut I heard that her pussy stinks so make sure that she fucking takes a bath first\nI come second to none\nMy verbal weapon is perpetuous, and it's just as effective as guns\nYou destined to plunge, homie, I find it pleasant and fun\nLike having sex with a nun (What the heck have ya done!?)\nWhoa, I'm known to hate, I use foul language to motivate\nI know I'm dope, okay, but Hop ain't real was just a role I play\nEarth, I don't know this place, but I just wanna stroll away\nInto my home in space wearing a pair of flying rollerblades\n\n[Outro]\nEhhhhhh, fuck"

Every day is a rerun\nTechnology's advanced, as people how far have we come?\nYeah, I can see that time's grown, but still I'm mind blown\n'Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside they iPhone\nThey always textin' and postin' statuses hourly\nBut in reality, there's no sign of a personality\nIt's cowardly, we shielded like we scared to get some allergies\nThe human being is what we don't know how to be\nAnd honestly these issues really suck to know\nBut I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow, so God, show me where the fuck to go\n\n[Hook]\nI can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human\n(I'm only human)\nOne monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid\nDon't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)\nThe problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign\nMaybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'\n\n[Verse 3]\nHow can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?\nThese rappers blowin' up, but through my eyes they not as real to me\nThey constantly conceal the beast, but never try to heal the streets\nTeachin' girls to be a slut, but never make 'em feel unique\nHow can we feel fine this way? Open up your minds today\nThe matrix got you young, owin' a debt you'll spend your life to pay\nStressed out, assumin' that you'll be more happy inside your grave\nDon't tell me about no fuckin' struggle then, nigga, 'cause I know pain\nTo the point where I felt like life was shit\nGrowin' up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with\nShit is just stuck repeatin', the world is tough to be in\nMunchin' on fast food, don't even know what the fuck I'm eatin'\nAmerica, I gave it my all\nStill you guys arrested me for bein' black and standin' on a sidewalk\nIt doesn't matter if I'm breakin' laws or bein' harmless\nI'm automatically hated by cops 'cause my dark skin\nGod was my smartest option\nMy soul is mine, y'all ain't gonna bargain off it\n'Cause if you do that means the darkness profits\nThe sky is where I got my heart adopted\nMan, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this\nBut y'all assume that I'm just startin' nonsense\nBut I promise y'all the fuckin' world is gon' remember Marcus Hopson\nThere's consequences for enlightenment\nBut if I have to hide the truth to live then I'mma die just like my idols did\n\n[Hook]\nI can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human\n(I'm only human)\nOne monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid\nDon't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)\nThe problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign\nMaybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'"

(blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood\n\n[Verse 3]\nBeat niggas till they have concussions (woah)\nRape wives and then laugh at husbands (woah)\nAnd if you down with the mass destruction (what)\nToast to it with a glass of blood then (blood)\nPray to God for a night to start\nI'm a psycho nigga finna top the charts\nBeing shot with darts till it stops your heart\nAnd chopped apart and thrown up in a shopping cart\nAnd pushed off a cliff, there's no alternate\nEnding that involved with this, it's your fault I'm pissed\nYou're gonna suffer the consequences\nYou can not prevent this shit, I promise it, come on (blood)\nPretty clear that my brain's not there\nI be looking for it when I shave my hair\nBlack is the color that I paint my lair\nAnd the way I break niggas everyday is not fair\nIt's all because of the rage I bare\nSee I'm down for whatever, just say \"I dare\"\nMy nut sack is the biggest so you niggas gonna have to murder me if you wanna take my pair (blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou don't like me? Tune it out\nI'm livin' life on the foolish route\nWhen I hit the kitchen, I butcher niggas until they drain slowly, but only when the moon is out\nI get this way when my mood is down\nSome even think that I'm rude and foul\nOut of all the lovely children my mother gave birth to, I was the stupid child (blood)\nBack in the day, when I was in elementary, I would chisel a pencil until it sharp as fuck\nLeavin' the bullies laid out, on the playground\nWhen they came round, yell \"fuck\" if you're raw as nuts, come on (fuck)\nThe sight of blood is so marvellous, stab a nigga in his stomach till you scar the gut\nHit 'em in the spine until you paralyze him and fill him with lighter fluid and go ahead and spark him up\nAnd then abracadabra, am I missing brain cells? That doesn't matter\nMakin' you scream makes me a happier rapper\nYou don't want trouble then your ass better back up\nFast little bastard (blood)\nI was born as a natural hazard, I turn lives into massive disasters\nLook over your shoulder when I'm in the area\nYou might get hit in the cranium with the back of a hammer (blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood"

Think before attacking me\nI know I'm quick to get outta line like I have to pee\nIt's obvious that I got your heart thumping\nI may look like a fucking idiot, but I promise I'm far from it\n\n[Hook]\nA year ago I wasn't all that\nNow all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack\nAm I your best friend? What?

A snobby and deadly poet\nSo nigga put down the pen 'cause I probably already wrote it\nI'm the nigga that Hollywood barely noticed\nFor pullin' cards, it's easy as sockin' on Gary Coleman\nHow did you get a deal without havin' no type of talent\nThe shit you write is invalid, you gettin' your mic impounded\nI'm livin' in a dump, you livin' life in a palace\nDinin' with Caesar salads, man how do you guys allow it?\nYo, you weak niggas in the limelight trippin'\nBut I won't let you slide like friction\nNot tryna be ya buddy in this rap shit, I like dissin'\nSo you can kiss my ass and watch the white eyes glisten\nYa'll nigga's be regulatin' the area\nHesitatin' to scare to some defamation of character\nI got it locked no separatin' the barriers\nMedicate your hysteria, heaven's waitin' to carry ya\n\n[Hook]\nMy hot 16's be on that ill shit! (uh huh)\nYour hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)\nBaby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time\nRIGHT NOW!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a pro but I kick it with the beginners\nThat what I whip up for dinner it's been up on my agenda\nI came and left but now I'm finna re-enter\nShiver-me-timbers, how the fuck can a nigga be realer?\nI don't know but my flow, is so cold, mistah oh no\nAt your door, I'm ready fo' war\nWhen you was flossin' on me tryna swerve in your Hummer\nI was plottin' way bigger nigga, word to your mother\nMy verses are butter, I emerge from the gutter\nTo step up inside the booth and then work mothafuckers\nI'm hungry as all of the roaches that lurk in my cupboard\nYou should be duckin' and runnin', send the word to the others\nI'm a fuckin' nightmare in your worst hell\nAnd I'm leavin' nigga's stuck behind the bars, they don't deserve bail\nYou see wackness doesn't sit on my nerves well\nYou couldn't bust with a dick full of sperm cells\n\n[Hook]\nMy hot 16's be on that ill shit! (uh huh)\nYour hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)\nBaby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time\nRIGHT NOW!\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou see I'm lyrically bashin' up on your feelings\nI'm bad and I don't conceal it, this dragon is known for killin'\nThat's the reason I'm baggin' these hoes and grillin'\nMy madness is so appealin' and swagger is on a billion\nAside from all the provocative hellishness\nI'm somewhat underground, but got the commercial elements\nAccording to ruthless records it wasn't evident\nSo I'm a 9/11 the label bitches to hell with it\nI'm that crazy nigga, you can't be iller\nI'll pick ya fuckin' mom up in a 18-wheeler\nYeah I'll hit it, but if she don't wanna pay me scrilla\nI'll let a rottweiler fuck her till the rabies kill her\nMy hobbies are rappin' vicious, slappin' bitches\nGrabbin' digits, and I occasionally laugh at midgets\nI'm hardly sane and half horrific with a dab of mischief\nNever rap no shit if I haven't lived it, it's that specific\n\n[Hook]\nMy hot 16's be on that ill shit! (uh huh)\nYour hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)\nBaby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time\nRIGHT NOW!\n\n[Outro]\nWelcome to RAW\nWelcome to RAW\nWelcome to RAW\nWelcome to RAW\nWelcome to RAW\nWe gone have one hell of a time, RIGHT NOW!"

No hoes hopping inside my ride\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a beam just like the shining sun\nBut I'd be a fool if I say you're the one\nAnd I'd be the water that's raining down on the land\nBut I won't be your man\nYou see I got other plans\nYou know what you know what\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery girl I meet, always talking bout \"I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ew\nYeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills\nI just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy\nOh god I'd date him with no prob\nAnd if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom\"\nBitch, what's your problem? You expect me to be optim -mistic, for the mischief you bring your senseless bitch you out of\nYour mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track\nBlack and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back\nWhat the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic?\nA loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package\nI feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me\nNo charcoal breath who be hitting a stogie and not one that'll say shit to blow me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a beam just like the shining sun\nBut I'd be a fool if I say you're the one\nAnd I'd be the water that's raining down on the land\nBut I won't be your man\nYou see I got other plans\nYou know what you know what\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\n\n[Verse 3]\nI like nature, ah you too? Wow, we got so much in common boo\nDon't be assuming that I'm going to love you because if you do I'll cut you out of my life I promise you\nI'm down to earth and I'm an honest dude\nYou barely be giving me any homage dues\nI would definitely regret it and probably get a big headache if I was stupid and got with you\nHow many guys have you let bone you? (Uhhh?) Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh?\nCould've been 5, could have been 10, could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh?\nI ain't trying to be another one on the list, that'll make me a true son of a bitch\nYup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks\nBest believe that I'ma pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts\nYou say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked\nYou can't find a good man that's so sad, I think it's because you act so wack\nSo don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a beam just like the shining sun\nBut I'd be a fool if I say you're the one\nAnd I'd be the water that's raining down on the land\nBut I won't be your man\nYou see I got other plans\nYou know what you know what\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, maybe we can meet up tomorrow and we can give it one more try\nBut in the meantime I'ma have to say goodbye baby 'cause right now you're not my type\nNow listen, I'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama\nI'm not introducing you to mama"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Hopsin]\nYou motherfuckers are quick to judge. It's all good though. You don't know shit about shit. If you only knew what I knew, if you only knew what I could do. If you could only see what I could see you would probably stop bothering me\n\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nYeah\nI independently started this shit, marketing hits\nStarving for chips, no gasoline to start off the whip\nFelt like the only nigga labels wasn't bargaining with\nMy heart has been ripped, I stuck with it as hard as it gets\nThese producers would always blow me off\nNow that I'm blowing up, they don't recall\nTalking about \"Yo, you my homie, dawg\" (My nigga)\nOh, now you wanna hop on the Hop train\nKnowing damn well since '04 I had hot flames (The fuck outta here)\nMy real buddies was mainly the worst\nHating to shoot my videos without me paying them first\nSo I slide 'em 100 bucks to watch 'em bitch on how it ain't enough (Man)\nThat money got my cell, internet and cable cut!\nA real homie would've gave a fuck and not expect to pay upfront\nThen get the money later when I'm making some\nNobody saw the bigger picture except me\nThey neglect me, only thing that protects me is FV (Come on)\n\n[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]\nYou don't always have to stick by my side\nJust make sure you remember me when I die\nI am raw, I am raw\nJust to let you niggas know\nBitch I am raw, I am raw\nDon't forget me when I'm gone\nBitch I am raw\n\n[Verse 2: SwizZz]\nI was a high school grad preparing to go to college\nAn enthusiastic freshman, major in Economics\nI didn't have a clue what to expect to be honest\nBanging beats in my dorm, streaming Pornhub constant\nI figured I could make it out in four years tops\nStudy religiously and graduate, apply for a job\nThe rap thing was secondary, I was putting it off\nCalling it quits, assuming I had better chances playing ball (Yep)\nMy third year came and suddenly that changed\nI couldn't bear watching my mom at home suffering pain\nTryna fight off the strain of only having half a stomach\nPlus a handicap back from a surgery that helped nothing!\nSo I returned to the valley and called the homie\nHop was on Ruthless getting shelved like a trophy\nI told him how I left my life in the OC\nAnd we concluded that we could both use FV\n\n[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]\nYou don't always have to stick by my side\nJust make sure you remember me when I die\nI am raw, I am raw\nJust to let you niggas know\nBitch I am raw, I am raw\nDon't forget me when I'm gone\nBitch I am raw\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nThis was written for niggas who wouldn't give me dap\nNiggas who told me that I had sissy rap\nThis was written for all the bitches I used to called who never hit me back\nUntil they heard the word I was buzzing, c'mon don't give me that (Shit)\nYou backed out, now you tryna roll with my clique?\nWhere the fuck were you when my signing bonus was spent?\nWhere the fuck were you when I got the notice for rent\nSaying I was getting evicted and I was hopeless as shit?\nSee I keep some names handy and you got thrown on the list\nThat's how you know that I'm pissed, I got you, don't even trip\n'Cause I'm rude over the nicest beats, you had to go ignite the heat\nYou might agree to beef, but yo I'm not the type you'd like to meet\nLife's indeed a journey that I have yet to finish\nHopefully my career's something that will be epidemic\nYou'll always know that it's Hopsin the way I wreck a sentence\nRealness, I represent it, raw, I'm the definition\n\n[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]\nYou don't always have to stick by my side\nJust make sure you remember me when I die\nI am raw, I am raw\nJust to let you niggas know\nBitch I am raw, I am raw\nDon't forget me when I'm gone\nBitch I am raw"

O-P\n\n[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]\nYo, Locked and loaded\nReady to bring da ruckus\nThuggish ruggish\nNo other rapper can touch it\nI'm disgusted, fuck it\nNah, I'm in a rush to put the pressure on\nLet it be known, ask yo girlfriend who she sextin' on\nBetter known, It's Mister Knock-Knock the panties down\nYou a hand-me down, Hammer down what they invested on\nShoulda' left it alone, Shouldn't have left her at home\nIt gets her off of you, I'm watchin' as she testin' it on\nMy marijuana scent all up in yo shit\nYou ain't shit, You as solid as my spit\nI gotta couple rappers on my list\nBetter get established before I get to wrapping up careers\nKing Dizzy coming to give it to you straight\nTaking place, Fuck being different\nI care about being great\nNigga kill the hate\nI'm coming just to kill it in yo state\nFuck the world, Fuck you\nRun in place, I penetrate\nWe the shit\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Hopsin]\nI know how\nLong you've waited (Waited for what?)\nFor the day\nAll these games end\n\n[Chorus: Hopsin]\nKnock-knock, who's there?

Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHold up, throw me the mic, I got a flow to recite\nYou got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like\nA broke nigga who thuggish, always be talkin' rubbish\nSteady be causing ruckus, all because you were sluttish\nJesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!\nThat's the same motherfucker that you had cheated on me with! (What?!)\nI knew this would happen without a question\nBut you said, \"I never have sex without protection\"\nBitch please, you left me flowing down shits creek\nYou sex driven like a big freak\nPlus our relationship has been breached, you took a big leap\nAnd rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me\nAnd now I'm s'pose to be the father and the mental guide\nLike, \"Sure, I'll take care of the little guy\"\nShit, you ain't puttin' me through the stress\nI put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death, bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm far from a fuckin' life saver\nNot you're friendly neighbor, but yet you called me during your labor\nIt's not my issue, take me off the menu\nI'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you\nI'm not a mean guy, hate to sound that foul\nBut I don't give a fuck about that child (You damn right)\nSee you chose him, then he fucked you, tag, you\u2019re it\nToo bad his dick didn't have any insurance\nYou knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it\nNow your ass hittin' me up thinking I would do it\nHoping we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid\nThat's kinda stupid, face the facts, bitch, your life is ruined\nAnd don't be callin' me like, \"My life's a crazy blur\nRashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt\nI wish that me and you could go back to the way we were\"\nShit we can, just get rid of the baby first\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Bridge]\nNow I won't be your baby's daddy, I'm not the one\nBut you can still give me some head and maybe swallow some cum\nAnd if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean\nBut don't ever send the baby to find me\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo\nDo you remember when I told you I would love you forever\nAnd broke up with my girlfriend Heather\nKicked her to the curb, and then I got with you thinkin' you were better\nAnd found out you were a heart shredder\nYeah, I felt really stupid after that\nBecame the nigga that my crew was laughin' at, I was foolish, that's a fact\n(Yup) So this is karma, you been on my shit list\nSo ha ha ha ha, that's what you get, bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Outro]\nHey, that's life\nYou fuck me over\nHe fucked you, you got pregnant\nNow you're fucked\nYou had me\nYou had me, that's the funny thing about it\nAnd you blew it\nHa ha ha"

You on a oneway street\nEither collide or turn it around, that'd be your best route\nListen, y'all need to stop with the dissing\nNo one pays attention, so quit with the chitchat\nListen, y'all niggas steadily fishing\nYou riding me hard and my girl want my dick back\nListen, these niggas play like it's cool\nAnd then run their mouth soon as I'm leaving, why is that?\nListen, I've been touring off an album\nI ain't even dropped, you pro'ly think I rigged that (Nice)\nI'm the plate, nigga, you just the dish rack\nThe whole Ill Mind series, I done did that\nNiggas double taking, getting whiplash\nHow you tryna school me when I skip class\nConfrontation with you is just quick cash\nWhat the fuck you gon' do when your ship crash?\nI got the juice, don't get caught in the splish splash\nWe don't fit in together, we mitch match\nI am the misfit that nobody likes\nI am colder than ice, I will hold up your life\nYou bigging you up, you were so overhyped\nYou were no good with mics, you'll be gone overnight\nI saw my window and I dove on it right\nPlus the flow is precise, I'm just rolling the dice\nYou claim that you got the shit on lock\nThinking you safe, but homie, I done broken it twice\nAlright\n\n[Chorus]\nAll around the fucking planet\nNiggas on my shit, dog\nWest side, east side, north side, south side\nBitches on my dick, dog\nSnatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga\nCash on fleek, I'm that nigga\nPast O.D., I'm that nigga\nAs for me, I'm that nigga\nAll around the fucking planet\nNiggas on my shit, dog\nWest side, east side, north side, south side\nBitches on my dick, dog\nSnatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga\nCash on fleek, I'm that nigga\nPast O.D., I'm that nigga\nAs for me, I'm that nigga\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, got a brand new chick\nShe a law student working real hard out in Cape Town\n(Cape Town, Cape Town) I became ill\nWhen I hit the beat raw, it was ass up, facedown\n(Facedown, facedown) Homie, you ain't shit\nYou tryna shine, I'ma turn your sunlight into a gray cloud\n(Rain, rain) Had to hit you with a new flow\nSaying that I sound like Slim Shady during 8 Mile\nYou signed your life away to record labels\nWhile I'm signing big ol' voluptuous titties\nI run through the city, the ladies are comfortable with me\nThey're wet and I want to go swimming\nA wonderful feeling (Woo)\nI strike that pussy like a thunderbolt hitting (Woo, woo)\nLadies say \"Oh my God, papi\nIt's all in my hair now, your cum is so sticky\" (Yikes)\nAm I a sellout or prodigy?\nWord on the street is the question is suss\n(Suss) Niggas threw dirt on my name\nIt's ironic that they just got left in the dust\n(The dust) You got your head in the clouds?\nI am convinced that your head is just stuck\nHmm, don't make me go through my files\nAnd pull all of your dirty evidence up (Oh no)\nNiggas it's been on, my pen strong\nIf one shot fires I'm Kim Jong, so bitch, run\nI sent bombs like ISIS from Islam\nYou drenched on with a light mist of piss, son\nWho you know could get it like this?

I thought I had it figured out\nSee I panic and I pout\nYo I've had it man, I'm out\nGod damn it, this shit's a clout\nI'm the baddest, ain't no doubt\nBut my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout\n\n[Hook]\nHow come the world is always quick to turn they back on me\nWon't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep\nI'll be in your dream\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dream\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou all assume I'm evil, but actually I'm so nice\nI've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life\nUnhappy here with no wife, don't ask me I don't know why\nI'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by\nI knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts\nA bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park\nA bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard\nThe same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart\nShe cut it like an avocado, secretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles\nHanging with thugs or sucking a lots of cock yo\nThe biggest slut from Loveland, Colorado\nFuck a hoe, that\u2019s Hopsin\u2019s motto, my heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow\nShe met another guy who left the baby stuck inside\nHer vagina then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life\nNow she hits me up and I\nSay go suck a nut, goodbye\nAll you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo live a decent life what all does it take\nI tried and tried to be the best but nothing falls in the place\nAnd I'm a man but my struggle is gonna cause me to break\nAnd just evolve me to hate I'm in a nauseous state\nAnd shit it probably is fake but who's in control of it me or god\nIs he the cause of why am I here the reason's odd\nI'm broke and need a job, for spending cheese on broads\nBut y'all don't see the flaws I coat it up to keep it raw\nAnd mc's who's got the most talent in this whole planet\nDon't never get recognized when they dope at it\nSo they go back to the block hustlin' and dope addicts\nSome niggas got the 'it factor' some niggas don't have it\nYo I'm at my last tears cuz everytime I think I'm out the matrix\nI get sucked right back in\nBut man I'm hopin' things are change and the soul in me remains\nCuz the talent that I've got is way too cold to be contained\n\n[Bridge] (x2)\nNo, no\nWhat did I do to deserve this?\nNo, no\nI don't even have a purpose\n\n[Collision]\nPillow man (x4)\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me\n\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nI'm fucking tired of playing God when you in need\nThe choices you made are on you completely, what's it got to do with me?\nYou mobbing through the streets, clueless but it's not like you could see\nYou know I'm cool, so you take it like it's an opportunity\nTo get some free money, damn you ain't got no shame\nYou been living off of my dough, bitch I'm not your bank\nYou be asking to borrow knowing that you not gon' pay\nAbusing the privilege my nigga, that is not okay\nWhy don't you get it? I shouldn't have to explain it\nOur foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments\nSo create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it\nI'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience\nYou the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog\nBut I should not have to pay for your downfall\nChoose your faith, but still even if your day seem great\nJust know I got your fucking back either way, you already know\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nNow my own family tripping, I ain't think I would get this shit from siblings\nThe money I'm making is yours right? It's a given\nLet me tell y'all why I get a different feeling\nY'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in\nI don't recall any help or sympathies\nSince 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?\nCould have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand\nBut y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan\nFocused on yourself, and now you holding on for help\nYou were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell\nOh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal\nYou want the benefits without playing the courses on the field\nYou ain't even doing your best or trying\nDon't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying\nJust know that when your bright days going straight\nI couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nMoney can leave you isolated 'cause people are shady\nSo why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it\nTo get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways\nEven taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken\nFoes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted\nAround them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships\nDon't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit\nMooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just\nNot the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em\nThat is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in\nA boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone\nSisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em\nThat's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries\nIn due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me\nI know that if my brightest days turn gray\nYou wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSoon after I dropped Raw the spotlight creeped up\nI received love from fans throughout the world, yeah, seems nuts\nIs it God, could it be luck?\nI put my toes it the sand and ended up with my feet stuck\nWhen the storm comes, then how should we address it?\nMy situation with Ruthless turned out to be a blessing\nDuring the time it left every ounce of me affected\nBut when it was done I saw that I was bound to be a legend\nBut I'm lost\nThe fame drivin' me crazy, cry when I'm angry, the game's trying to change me\nSinister record labels got desires to paint me\nAs the world puts they fucking hands high to embrace me\nHow would you take it in?\nI honestly can't pretend\nThe only reason I started rapping was to make a friend\nAnd now I got fans who love me for creating sins\nYou think fame ain't got a dark side? Think again, yo\n\n[Chorus]\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, scared I might never get a wife\nCloser I move into the limelight shit is like\nGirls just want to be next to me cause I rip the mic\nSayin' they love me, but the vibe I get isn't right\nWhat if I flop when my album dropped\nAnd went broke? Baby, tell me, would your love just stop?\nSee I'm in love with you, but you in love with Hop\nThe struggle's real, but through your eyes it's fun to watch\nI swear to god I used to fiend for it\nI see the fire but I keep going\nI smell the sins from the breeze blowin'\nMy crew is telling me to beast mode it\nI feel like I'm going to hell, I keep it up even my priest knows it\nSo many women and the money is great\nBut this life just isn't me and I don't want to be fake\nI didn't think that it would come to this day\nIt's time I put my alter ego to the side and leave him stuck in his grave\n\n[Chorus]\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\n\n[Verse 3]\nShit, not anymore, my soul's rotten and sore\nI hear a knock at the door, for real\nI got a lot to endure, there ain't no stopping the storm\nHomie, the top isn't warm, so chill\nI think I need my light bulb fixed\nAs of lately I ain't be getting hyped on shit\nLife's a journey, you gotta find your niche\nI'm leaving this tight space because I don't fit\nNow I'm moving away, my whole life I'ma start from scratch\nAs an artist I'm trapped, fuck Hop, Marcus is back\nFor a while it's gon' be hard to adapt\nBut I'm willing to go through it, I ain't starving to rap\nI'm soul searching, it's like I'm living with no purpose\nI tried find a spark to spit but there's no urges\nInside of me for me to pursue it, some people think that I'm stupid\nBut don't judge if you ain't went through it\nI'm out\n\n[Chorus (Extended)]\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am\nFame can make you insane (It's so strange)\nEveryday I feel I'm caught in the rain\nOnly very few have walked in my shoes\nI sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused\n'Cause I don't know who the hell I am"

That's where I went to school at\nAll the black kids said I was white-washed\nAnd the white kids said I was too black\nWhen I skateboarded I got booed at\nAt lunchtime I was who they threw food at\nI was tryin' so hard to cope with it\nI really wanted to run up on campus with two gats\nAnd just (ahh) let loose\nPut some niggas in the E.R. for tryna treat me like a retard\nWhere the fuck does my future lie? I can't see far\nMomma's little sweetheart, he developed an attitude\nPicked up a mic, that's a Hell of an avenue\nHe gon' take yo' ass to Hell and then back with you\nLife is a class you can tell I've been absent to\nMy massive doubt has got me wrapped around\nAnd then it drags me down a bit\nI don't know how to cast it out\nI try to rap profound so you could laugh about the shit\nTruth is, yo, I never laugh\nI'm lookin' for wherever Heaven's at\nThe black sheep, they won't let him past\nThey would rather get together\nTie him up and then behead his ass, got me hella sad\nListen!\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Hopsin]\nDo you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?\nLike the world is never gon' need you?\nI always do, every day is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for me\n\n[Chorus: Hopsin & Eric Tucker]\nAnd I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck\nAnd I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up\nMaybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings?\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nOh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nOh, I'm the black sheep\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nThat nigga whose brain is off, I am that\nMy train of thought left on Amtrak\nI take the loss and I stand back\nI can't play the cards with no hand clap\nI can't recall when this damn crap\nBecame so overwhelmin' I started rebellin'\n\"I hate\" is all as I stand as\nNever got no love from my niggas\nAnd no love from the hoes, pinned up in a hole\nTryna climb out the Devil's dark lab, but the oven is closed\nI don't ever leave the house much\nI never really thought this would be the outcome\nWish I had a window I was leapin' out from\nMy family is yellin', \"Please, Jesus, help him!\"\nWhen I'm out in the real world, I feel like nobody knows me\nWhat if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me?\nSee, this cold heart isn't cozy\nAm I below par and I don't see?\nI'm so disconnected from Earth\nMy hands are out so far but they won't reach\nShould I get in a coffin?\nNot many niggas would wanna kick it with me\nUnless they were gonna benefit of it\nMotherfuckers never interested in knowin' me\nThey just be just itchin' for Hopsin\nI'd be frontin' if I act like it isn't a problem\nI done shed tears contemplatin' my suicide in my room\nIsn't it awesome?

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBack when I was a young nigga playing in the sand\nI had some big dreams so I made a little plan\nYou was out partying while I was thinking in advance\nTryna get right hoping that one day I'd be the man\nThe years went by, I was M.I.A\nI got rid of all of the niggas that was in my way\nI saved nickels and quarters till I could afford a studio\nTo record and then get money off the shit I say\nThen my dream came true and the fraud niggas came out\nSee me ballin' out, they think we all gettin' paid now\nTalking like \"Hopsin, oh you're a great pal\"\nFuck you, stick my balls in your dang mouth\nNow every other week you hit me up for money\nFrontin' like you always been down (pal!)\nBut back then when a nigga was living bummy\nYour ass was nowhere to be found (wow!)\nLook my nigga (Marcus) I ain't tryin to be one of ya fake ass goldigger\nHomies that's not it (that's not what I'm doin)\nBut can I borrow 500 dollers I'mma pay ya ass back next week I promise (please)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere was a chick I asked out back in \u201906\nMade her a love song, and she was like \u201cNo bitch\u201d\nGave me the song back, and I was like \u201cOh shit\nI\u2019m so stupid, I should\u2019ve never wrote this\u201d\nShe was a dime piece, top of the list\nA Latin girl, and her skin had a tropical twist\nShe never used to call me, I always had to call her\nAnd deep down inside it was making my heart hurt\nSo her life went on, she didn\u2019t even involve me\nThen last year I ran into her in a Walgreens\nShe was like, \u201cMarcus, how are you? (oh my God)\nYou finally made it, I\u2019m so proud of you\u201d\nSo the next day she called me and asked to kick it\nFor the sake of the old me that was sad, I did it\nCome to find out she was never that terrific\nEspecially a week later when she asked me this shit\n\u201cHey um, Marcus, I really really hate to be a bother\nBut my rent is due, and I\u2019m like broke as fuck\nSo can you please lend me ten hundred dollars, please\u201d\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nMmm-hmm\nSee my ex girl think she slick\nMan let me tell ya how she tried to do me\nShe said she didn\u2019t have a vehicle to drive to work in\nSo she came and asked me for 2 Gs\nAnd although I wasn\u2019t that concerned\nShe said her mom would pay me back, soon as she got her tax return\nSo I committed and did it, thinkin\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t forget it\nBut she forgot it, now my stomach got a nasty burn\nI called her! And said, \u201cBitch! Where my money?! You got that?!\u201d\nShe said, \u201cNot yet, see my mom\u2019s mad\nShe said she isn\u2019t gonna pay, you can drop dead\n'Cause I got into a fight with her, she\u2019s a hot head\u201d\nI\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s between you two, not me!\nWhat the hell does that have to do with my cheese!\u201d\nShe said, \u201cOk, ok, stop please\nI swear I\u2019ll pay it all back Marcus, in five weeks\u201d\nHuh, five weeks huh?\nIt\u2019s been three months and I ain\u2019t even heard from her\nChanged her damn number, shit\nBitch played me like a dumb motherfucker\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Outro]\nGive me that dough, Give me that money\nGive me that cheese, Give me that money\nGive me that yea yea yea, Give me that money\nYea yea, Give me that money\nSay yea yea yea yea\nBaby give me that yea yea yea yea\nGive me that yea yea yea yea! Ha\nThis for the bitches that oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo\n(exhales) fuck\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be able to pay Marcus back\nAh"

Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nYeah, you behind if you don't know the power (nigga)\nPlotted this shit the moment Ruthless started goin' sour (what?)\nNiggas is sayin' fuck you to us, but we have spoke it louder\nNow they come to us for advice in the game, they know it's ours (true)\nCause It's so hard just to survive in this era\nWe learn from trial and error, it's hard for cowards to bare us\nThey know the style is terror, nigga we everywhere\nYeezy and Hov ain't the only niggas that's wildin' in Paris\nBack in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode\nReppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope\nWe've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle\nSo we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown\nSwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us\nWe're guaranteed to make a win\nI said I'm in, let the games begin\nSo he introduced us, then after that\nWe plotted on some ways to make us trend, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Hopsin]\nYa'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming\nThat's how I roll, dawg\nThe second niggas take they eyes off me\nI leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg\nI'm the realest, believe me\nNiggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me\nYe-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nYou see, I took a shot out of the glass of mischief\nMade an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit\nI figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen\nAnd tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas\nThen I blew up way faster than what I had predicted\nIt's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image\nSome people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position\nBut I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it\n2011, went on a nation wide tour\nCame back and dropped that Ill Mind 4\nThat put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days\nI celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid\nI shot a video with my nigga Tech and B.o.B\nI went from feeling lonely to how does everyone know me?\n2012, I made the XXL Freshman list\nI knew that this fuckin' game was gon' be mine when I stepped in it\nCome on, man\n\n[Chorus: Hopsin]\nYa'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming\nThat's how I roll, dawg\nThe second niggas take they eyes off me\nI leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg\nI'm the realest, believe me\nNiggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me\nYe-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nI was online chillin', bloggin' and what not (okay)\nI stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)\nI asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, \"Come on Hop\nI been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot.\"\nIf he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked\nHe said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot\nWe flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?\nHe said, \"Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch.\"\nA few months later, one of the homies had stopped me\nAsked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast\nI said, \"probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin 'bout?\"\nHe showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!\nI'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz\nAnd Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!\nWe had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up\nNow we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts\n\n[Verse 4: SwizZz]\nYo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life\nRomp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic\nI tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA\nWhile I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way\nJunior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream\nCalculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme\nHop was gazin' at the moonlight, I just hit the valley scene\nDame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team\nF-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga\nSeven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger\nAnd we're just now gonna start the shit, I've been up out the picture\nDizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver\nSo I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed\nMeet the aftermath, the aftermath, the Funk is in your face\nIndependent livin', we control every decision made\nWhat up Dame? Prepare the reign, we killin' this thing, it won't stop, bitch!\n\n[Outro: Hopsin & SwizZz]\nHaha, Zzzeed up\nDon't act like you don't know what time it is fool\nSwizZz\nDizzy motherfuckin' Wright\nJarren Benton\nDJ Hoppa\nLet's make it\n\n[Chorus (Condensed): Hopsin]\nYe-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me\nIt's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga"

Why do I feel\nLike I'd be runnin' in fear if ever the end was near?\"\nIt's like, sin is in so much of everyone's daily habits\nThat we don't even know we do it whenever it happens\nThen it settles in like I should've never did that shit\nI wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this\nIf you had to turn your test in today\nYou think you would pass it or would you rest in the flame?\nWho knows, there's only one way to find out\nAnd if you die now, no turnin' back, it's your life pal\n\n[Hook]\nGazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee\nHe says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me\nOh na\u2014na\u2014naaah\nGazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me\nBut mama told me never to talk to strangers"

I don't have control\nI need a chaperone when I'm back at home in a padded zone\n'Cause I've been known to speak in a savage tone and slap a ho\nDo I even have a soul?\nMy thoughts are so unimaginable\nMy brain just hasn't grown\nSince I climbed through my momma's vaginal\nAnd I been asked to go to a shrink, it ain't gon' happen, bro\nSuck a dick and swallow a massive load!\nBitch, I can explode at any moment\nDon't get me goin', 'cause a lot can happen\nYou talkin' crap and wake up in a fuckin' Saw contraption\nA raw assassin, you see me you better be haulin' ass then\nYour gashes cannot be treated with Tylenol or Aspirin\nNo cotton swab or napkin can clean the mess up\nIt's me and my alter ego against the world, it's just us\nAin't no one who textin' my cellular phone except sluts\nIt's clear there's a problem with me, so guess what?\n\n[Hook]\nI must be on somethin'\nLately I been actin' kinda cuckoo\nMomma said I got a screw or two loose\nI must be on somethin'\nThe doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood\nI ain't just been feelin' like I used to\nI must be on somethin'\nI been lost and ain't nobody found me\nTo be honest it ain't safe to be around me\nI must be on somethin'\nThis shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones\nFuck it, man, Lord knows\nI must be on somethin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe world has fucked me, it's time to get even now\nThey say I'm the one no one wants to be around\nGuess it's my deceivin' smile\nGuess it's because I been treatin' people foul\nMakin' songs about 'em, talkin' shit and then freakin' out\nThis is how I handle all solutions\nThere's no false illusion\nFuck an evil witch, bitch, I'm the demon that's off the broom stick\nWhere's the fire? I'm walkin' through it\nY'all ain't got the balls to do it\nI'm talkin' stupid, it's all inclusive\nWith my psychotic state, filled with a lot of hate\nI'ma operate on my enemies\nChop 'em up and then drop 'em on pots and plates\nI'm not to fuck with, so stop it, let's not debate\nUsually never talkin' much 'cause I'm stuck in a awkward state\nThe pain I have's everlastin'\nWon't be surprised when I'm left in ashes from my hellish habits\nThe hell is happenin'?\nThe condition I'm in is probably worse than you can imagine\nMake sure you say this shit to whoever's askin'\n\n[Hook]\nHe must be on somethin'\nLately I been actin' kinda cuckoo\nMomma said I got a screw or two loose\nI must be on somethin'\nThe doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood\nI ain't just been feelin' like I used to\nI must be on somethin'\nI been lost and ain't nobody found me\nTo be honest it ain't safe to be around me\nI must be on somethin'\nThis shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones\nFuck it, man, Lord knows\nI must be on somethin'"

How you make a whole a lot of money like white man?\"\nJust know I does it, this shit, it's nothing\nAsk 'round I buzz to smash down, the sluts and I am erupting\nFar from a reluctant bringing the funds in\nI love this, you dumb bitch\nWho am I? Hope you guessed amazing\nJust embrace it, been underestimated\nLeft for bait, and now I'm 'bout to head to greatness\nI gets down like a nigga weapon raisin'\nNo hesitation with the bad upbringing\nYou can tell from hotels, I'm sexing babes\nAnd I'm the man that's the best of statements\nNow I rest my case, man\nFuck this shit"

We could try my place?\"\nPete's like \"Nah, how 'bout TGI Fridays?\nI really love you Lauren and I know you trust me\nBut it's our first time meeting, I don't wanna rush things\"\nShe says \"That's fine, I'll see you at twelve\nUntil then I love you baby, hope you'll be doing well\"\nShe takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff\nMake-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up\nNow it's about time she heads on out to Teej\nShe text messages Pete, \"Hey, I'm about to leave\"\nAnd she's so damn excited as her heart pounds and beats\nThat she almost left her house without her keys, geez\n\n[Chorus]\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe pulls up but Pete hasn't arrived yet\nShould she go in without him, she hasn't decided\nShe doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it\nSo she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids\nIt's twelve-twenty, Lauren picks up an appetite\nShe decides to go inside without him and have a bite\nThen her phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it\nPete says \"Baby, I'm gonna have to cancel it\"\nLauren says \"Why? What happened? What is it?\"\nThen Pete says \"I just heard my grandmother's real sick\nAnd I have to go and give her a visit\"\nThen Lauren says \"It's okay baby, go handle your business\"\nShe loves him too much so it didn't really bother her\nShe hops in the car, pulls off, somebody follows her\nBut she don't even notice 'cause her music's too loud\nAnd she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album\nNow she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out\nSoon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down\nShe drops her keys, the man picks 'em up\nThen drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck\nHe slapped her, then put tape on her mouth\nTo take from the sound of Lauren screaming rape really loud\nHe's going ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick\nThen he yells out \"Bitch, Pete never existed!\"\nHer heads spinning, then she just faints\nThe man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped\nFrom that day on nobody ever heard from her\n'Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her\nHe tossed her body in a off-road ditch\nHe said to her \"see you at the crossroad, bitch\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nCyber, cyber\n\n[Chorus]\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl"

Sometimes I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s up with you\nBut you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou probably think I\u2019m buzzing, raw, angry and rugged\nAww maybe he\u2019s thuggin\u2019 but that\u2019s how crazy my love is\nI\u2019m a dedicated romance brother whose been played\nWay to many times now I\u2019m resorting to switch blades\nSo if I say I love you, more than likely I mean it\nNext time I write an agreement for stupid trifling reasons\nTo dare to fight and the screaming a better life's what I\u2019m seeking\nHow come bitches now-a-days never try to be decent?\nI never even used to use the word bitch\nAnd every chick I ever called it fucking deserved it, they earned it\nI\u2019m the type of guy your parents want you to marry\nI ain\u2019t no mother fucking mind freak that haunts you who\u2019s scary\nBut when I\u2019m getting fucked over, that all changes\nI get dangerous, my mind turns oh so shameless\nAnd my veins just, pop out my head I\u2019m real anxious\nTo show you the true definition of what pain is, bitch\n\n[Hook]\nAnd there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)\nIf I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon\u2019 be murdered (murdered)\nDo you wanna die tonight? Sometimes I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s up with you\nBut you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you\nAnd there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)\nIf I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon\u2019 be murdered (murdered)\nDo you wanna die tonight?

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYo, white eyes, black tee\nIll rhymes, that\u2019s me\nHollywood's now labeled as lame\nBut I\u2019ve been on that raw shit since I came in the game\nFuck this! Rap niggas trying act like they punk rock\nTight jeans, Mohawks screaming \u201cfuck cops\u201d\nY\u2019all should get your fucking nuts chopped\nYou all look like you suck cock\nBust shots if you hate me\nYup that\u2019ll fix the problem\nPut me out there, leave it up to Mr. Goblin\nTo contribute to all the bullshit that\u2019s dropping\nSo he can take his kids out Christmas shopping\nLook at the niggas I'm spinning circles around\nMy verbal profound lyrics make them hurdle the town\nThey washed up 'til they gurgle and drown\nTheir whole dynasty I\u2019m burning it down\nFunk Volume, you\u2019ve heard of it now\n\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I\u2019m on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuicide, (huh?) trust I might\nTell 'em what my motto is fuck my life\nDon\u2019t need alcohol to upper-cut my wife\nSo much rage I could crush my mic\nSee I woke up on the wrong side of the bed\nMy brain works but the whole left side of it is dead\nThere\u2019s a little small gremlin inside of my head\nAnd lately I\u2019ve been feeling like I'm living life on the edge\nBut wait a minute, this ain\u2019t a gimmick, I can\u2019t pretend it\nI\u2019ma scream it loud to the world just in case they forget it\nBe careful of some of the knowledge that you take from critics\nThey tryin' to execute a nigga but I stay committed\nNew topic, mind over matter\nNever needed my arms to climb up a ladder\nYou wack niggas don\u2019t ever show signs of a rapper\nIt's getting too serious for you? Why, what\u2019s the matter yo?\n\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I\u2019m on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, the black man\u2019s back\nThere is no topic my raps can\u2019t smash\nThe state of hip hop that can\u2019t pass\nIt\u2019s all full of shit like a fat man\u2019s ass (eww)\nMay I please have just enough trust\nIn you motherfuckers to leave the rust of us stuck\nI turn my head and now you're messing stuff up\nAll that \"You! Turn it up!\" Just shut the fuck up\n(Damn) I\u2019m rude and I'm so wicked\nI\u2019ll make sure you never blow up\nLike a balloon with a hole in it\nI knock hustlers for a living, got muscles for the women\nGot puzzles for the children, blaow\nPlus I got a sick delivery, that\u2019ll have you niggas shivering\nAnd stunned from bombs I drop lyrically\nYou can\u2019t touch my shit\nSo I\u2019ma end it just like this\nSuck my dick!\n\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I\u2019m on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby"

(shit bitch), what you taking me for\nI guess a joke is what it must be\nI call you bitch then I call you ugly\nBecause you don't fucking love me\nThe things I do for you, you don't appreciate it\nEvery night I'm up I keep debatin'\nWhether or not I should call up your phone or leave you alone\nThis type of shit'll stay alive buried deep in my bones\nBut you don't even notice that\nAssuming you don't even know the facts\nFuck you I'm tired of holdin' back\nMy whole life I've been so nice and that's no lie\nGirl yo ass is faking with me and I know why\nCause you don't love me\n\n[Hook 2]\nI can sense that fake in you\nEvery time I look in your eyes (it's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me\nI don't believe that you love me\nI can sense that fake in you\nAnd deep down baby I know why (it's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me\nI don't believe that you love me\n\n[Bridge]\nLove, love, love, love, love\nOh why ain't you real with me, yea, yea\n\n[Verse 2]\nI really wanna solve this but not with violence\nIt's like if we wanna fix things I gotta be the one who apologizes\nAnd that's not the way it should be, I ain't a rookie\nYou got the game twisted up, take a look and see\nI even made you a song on various albums\nNow I'm like \"Fuck a bitch, I'll do better without one\"\nYou ain't gotta be with Hopsin (why)\nI know I made a hell of a impact upon your life, I'll never be forgotten\nBut you will soon as I finish this song cause you've getting upper hands and that shit is just wrong\nMy feelings were strong, it's time for me to really move on\nThe feelings is gone cause you don't really feel me no mo' (fuck it)\nIt's yo loss so bitch so long\nYou ain't gonna stress my ass oh no\nBe straight with me I'll be straight witchu\nBut since you fake with me I got hate for you\n\n[Hook 2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm tired of saying fuck a ho then always being gullible\nIt done happened so much I'm thinking it's uncontrollable\nI'm screaming \"I don't give a fuck\" all the sudden\nI'm driving to pick her up even though this bitch is nuts\nI don't even get a trust ring I just keep gettin' stuck\nBut shit I done seen enough, man fuck I should beat her up\nNah, cause if I did that then I'mma get mad\nAnd wish that I hadn't a did that so I just deal with this crap\nBut I ain't dealing with it ever again\nYour problems only turn me into the cleverest man\nNo settlin' in witchu, rather settle with sins\nFor the rest of my life they go to the devil instead\nThese levels have spread way further than I had imagined it\nI should've blew you off when I had a chance at it\nBut no, I was dumb I had to grab the shit\nTried to show you love and now disaster hit\n\n[Hook 2]"

Fuck it. I'll fight you\nYou stupid as your dumb fan puppets you lie to\nTelling them all that Lil wayne wanted to sign you\nBullshit thats a bunch of crap\nTheres no proof Wayne gave you a contract\nWhats up with that?\nAnd if he did put one up for grabs\nYou turned it down cause he wouldn't kiss you like he does his dad\n\nFuckin' fag back down or get burnt quick\nYou like the confidence I gave you on first diss?\nIt was on purpose, I knew if I threw the first hit you'd respond\nNow I'll prove that you ain't worth shit\n\nAm I a beast? Of course it is true\nI strangle Novi in his booth\nUsing his mic cord as a noose\nBoard up your room, you're doomed\nBy my whole rep of tunes\nAnd soon\nYour fans gonn' turn on you\nLike some wicked goons\n\nI don't care to pull your card, you deserve it\nYou're the reason white rappers have it so hard\nYou actin' tougher than a\nNappy afro that won't part, but you're like a mannequin, all body with no heart\nYour whole game is whack, Novi Novak?\nC'mon, be real.. what kinda name is that?\nYou a shameless act, who's lame, infact\nYou try to gain fame\nPretend like you were raised with blacks\n\nBlack psychos? You're glad I can't be called that\nI'm only crazy over Raw tracks\nBut you ain't nuts either nigga, so fall back\nClosest thing you ever been to nuts is lickin' your daddy's ballsack\n\nYou bullshittin' sayin' Hop sucks\nYou smoke a lot, but I'm one hit of dope you should not puff\nYa I heard your diss, it was hot stuff\nI see you Googled my name\nI tried yours, nothing popped up\nYou act like you the hugest star\nYou strung out like a used guitar\nYou couldn't get a hit standing in front of a moving car\nThe only time you tour is at an amusement park\n\nStop denying it you can't hold me\nThe flow is nastier than anchovies\nDon't be up at my show in Chicago tryna act like you my damn homie\nFuck Swag City followers, and Novi"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI never had a lot of hope\nI looked above and God had spoke\nAnd said I'm only here because my daddy's fuckin' condom broke\nDid I ever go to college? (Nope)\nAnd even got no job for dough\nI'm looked upon like I'm a joke\n'Cause this the shit that I promote\nThe Ill Mind Of Hopsin!\nWhere real life's an option!\nThe ill lines that I spit make you realize you're not sick!\nScience at its finest tell Bill Nye to watch it\nNow turn this shit the fuck up 'til you feel high and nauseous\nYou fake thug rappers be frontin' like you was born with Glocks\nBut only time you ever bang is when the door is locked\nNigga with attitude just without the S curl\nI break rappers like promises with my ex girl\nI'm kinda strange\nAnd I been this way since a young age\nThe biggest book I've read was less than one page\nI've always had slump grades\nNever use a condom like I want AIDS\nA nutcase, I'll smash your fuckin' dreams like a pugs face\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a high school drop out\nStill living at my moms house (My moms house) (Oh yeah!)\nI talk shit and get knocked out\nMy life sucks and I'm not proud\nOhhh do you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then\nDo you wanna be my friend\nI would love to be your friend\nCome on then\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy life's lame, I gotta pay money to fuck a whore\nI couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug of war\nI'm sick of big headed niggas feeling above the lord\nSomebody please give Soulja Boy the \"You Suck\" award!\nOut of all the styles you just had to pick the wack shit\nHopsin won't attack you if you practice\nYou faggot little bastard\nI never would have imagined this would happen\nI should fuckin' power drive your ass into a cactus\nYo, the game's mine, go rule you own\nI got a foolish zone\nI'm a schitzo who carpools alone\nRelax this is the music that I make for maniacs\nWho can't adapt with the rest, now watch the chain react\nThe world's cold, open your mouth and let me come inside\nI diss the fuck outta rappers its 'cause I wanna die\nI never face my problems\nShit I always run from mine\nI fucked my life up, now I'm tryin' to give your son a try\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, I come from a land where the kids fail to sick hell\nSo if you're frightened by my lyrics and looks bitch, yell\nBrainwashed, by Slim Shady and D12\nCrooked, Ludacris, Missy Elliot, Big L\nWell, y'all know Hopsin, but let me explain who Marcus is\nI make inspiration on music for the retarded kids\nWho suffer from Parkinson's\nWhose bodies have parts missin'\n'Cause it's Special Ed, man you really don't know how hard it is\nYou know I've always been a know-it-all\nI thought that when I'd grow up tall\nI'd get pussy and not be using blow up dolls\nI want more hoes\nI can't control my hormones\nI'm always watchin' pornos in my bedroom with the door closed\nWhoa! Hey Hopsin!\nStop with the mental hacker games\nYou've already brainwashed our son, Alexander James\nHe's only half your age, and now he masturbates\nHis whole perspective on the things that really matter changed\n\n[Hook]"

Giving me this mediocre lifestyle\nIf I'ma get it then what needs to happen right now\nI'm one week away from jumping off a cliff\nOr putting heat up to my head, and then dumping off a clip\nI know you think I'm just lying, 'cause last time\nI stood next to a cliff side, I bitched out but I'ma do it this time\nMan forget it, we both know I'm not\nI just say that stupid shit because I'm so low on guap\nBut for real though, God man you've got to help me out\n'Cause I know the road I'm rolling on is not a healthy route\nFrom now back to the day I was a little kid\nShit ain't even brighten up a little bit\nNow wouldn't you be just a little pissed if this was you\nYeah I'm cursed and it's the truth\nLooks like I'ma have to resort to violence to get the loot\n\n[Chorus]\nY'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P\nI'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)\nY'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P\nThank you for listening to my story (alright)"

(Aaah)\nEven if you did it wouldn't make a difference\n'Cause the people you tryna attract ain't listenin'\nThese bubbly wubblys suddenly buggin' me\nStomach be rumblin' mumblin' when I have to confront MCs\nIt troubles me but the honeys be lovin' me\nSome will be fiesty, but in the end I'ma feel on her double Ds\nI'ma have to end this dang song pretty soon\nAnd I ain't sayin' it just to be cool I really do\nFor real man, all my dang time is runnin' out\nOh too late, it's already comin' out!\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Outro:]\nI've been waiting for this my whole life\nOh yes, the feelin' is so right\nYeah, yeah, bubblies\nHuh, hah, ooh thank God yeah\nBubblies, haha"

No\nOnce these whack MCs find out I crucify souls\nThey'll be calling the number on Logic's suicide song"

That's a fatal attempt to do!\"\nYou thinking you spit the truth, I shake you and strip your jewels\nThen hang you up from a roof, and strangle you with a noose\nCremate you with four torches, flame of the torch scorching\nLeaving your corpse tortured of course it's hardcore shit\nAnd if there's ever a day that my pockets hurting\nI'm robbing you, with a Osama Bin Laden turban\nHip-Hop is urging for a new flock of verses to rock the circuit\nAll you flops emerging are pitiful, we did not deserve it\nYour style ain't even worth the fame\nIt's watered down more than New Orleans during a hurricane\nYour whole album was a verbal shame\nI'm Hopsin, don't act like you ain't heard the name"

   "lyrics": "[Verse: Hopsin]\nWhen I got the call to come up to Tim's, I couldn't wait to\nDamn it, who let the ape loose? Fuck a cage, I'ma break through\nGhetto, still sipping grape juice, who should I put the flame to?\nIf you hand me the throne just make sure it comes with a cape too\nThe only nigga with shit on lock is Hopsin, it ain't you\nWhen I'm up to bat man, my only option is Babe Ruth\nI never give into you incompetent lame dudes\nI buss you in your fucking head with a bottle of Grey Goose\nAnd I done lost myself, be happy? I don't know how to\nThe sunny days that I forgot to cherish are now blue\nNigga if you were me for while you would understand\nIf money doesn't change you, it'll change the ones around you\nSo I been ducking low, tryna hibernate and just find my way\nI've been gassing, I gotta find the breaks 'til my mind is straight\nI'm showing signs of hate 'cause I'm trapped in a darkness I embraced\nLook me in my eyes, you could tell I'm ready to die today\nIf you see me then don't come over\nI can't control my actions or emotions, the Devil's got the remote control an'\nStyle is cold and vulgar, got no composure\nDefeating me is like tackling a juggernaut with some broken shoulders\nSo don't provoke, this is deadly and isn't user friendly\n'Cause I own up to any truth you try to use against me\nSince high school I've been known to be an abusive MC\nI never stop the madness until I see you surrender\nWelcome to Savageville, where shit ain't average\nIt's madness, imagine a pack a stragglers swinging from chandeliers\nI'm in a Cavalier with a thot who drank a six-pack of beers\nGetting road head and she's driving, the fuck is happening here?\nI ain't calm and peaceful, nah, my small cerebral\nIs often evil, better hide like Doctor Jekyll's alter ego\nCall your people, I'm mad as addicts who lost the needle\nDon't buy my album because it's all illegal, too off to be on\nI'm talking Sm\u00e9agol, I launch torpedoes, bitch, I'm the dirtbag\nThat ran up on wearing a Purge mask when you got your purse snatched\nHere's your one way ticket to Hell in first class\nY'all all be making my nerves spaz, my word craft will make you disperse cash\nI'm the special ed nigga you ignored, y'all the motherfuckers that I do it for\nWhen I step inside the booth I'm lighting everything on fire like I was the Human Torch\nWhooping ass, kicking through the door, spewing gore, breaking windows of your new Accord\nAnyone who ever left better not be coming back to try to build a new rapport\nI'm wild rude, a foul dude, I prowl through\nI step on the mic and all the sudden my bowels move\nCatching bodies? I'm 'bout to\nI'm the one you should bow to, you niggas is ass, trash, cow poo\nStyle's based off pure vengeance, I'm a fierce engine\nYou'll get rear-ended, there's weird tension, my peers sense it\nI'm a feared misfit, a geared henchman, you scared senseless\nIt's tear-drenching, but you'll be hooked after a mere sentence\n\n[Outro: Hopsin]\nAnd I'm out this bitch. Tim Westwood TV, baby. Yeah. Undercover Prodigy"

Baby let me know\nWe go together perfectly, the Cancer and the Leo, yeah!\nI ride for you like a soldier\nBaby all you gotta do is give me your love, yeah\nThe world can get to know us, show love\nIf you'll be my valentine\n\n[Outro]\nHappy Valentine's day Alyce. I hope you like this. Sorry I can't be there, I'm on my tour but, just letting you know that I'm thinking about you, and I want the world to know as well. Peace"

Don\u2019t be telling me that\nYou kissing him? Damn right this is a jealous-y act\nI\u2019d rather fuck with you instead of relax\nBut when I\u2019m done you can bet I\u2019ll be back\nBitch defending my pack is way crazy\nYou make me stay angry\nYou gonna be in love with me?  Okay maybe\nI don\u2019t wanna turn this into the worst disaster\nI wanna live happily after, chilling with hella laughter\nBut you like the man on some crack\nThis shit led to the macs\nYou lucky that you ain\u2019t got hit in the head with a bat\nI\u2019m already knowing I\u2019m sorta psycho (Haha)\nBut you won\u2019t ever find another dude who loves you more than I do\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you\nYou ain\u2019t got no privacy\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you\nDon\u2019t be tryin to hide from me\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nI used to make you nice old songs\nNow it\u2019s the psycho songs\nCause I\u2019m the dude you don\u2019t like no more\nI was a nice a guy years a go\nNow you make me miserable\nI had to put this shit up on a track to let these niggas know\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy do I feel like, the police are watching me\nThere\u2019s nothing you can do to me\nWhy do I feel like, the police are watching me\nYou don\u2019t have to look past it\u2019s me\n\n[Deputy Doyle]\nWe have subject Marcus Jamal Hopson in custody now\n\n[Hopsin]\nMan!\n\n[Commanding Officer]\nBring him to the station, Doyle! Now!\n\n[Hopsin]\nAw, man\nYou watch Tracey, you won\u2019t get rid of me\nI don\u2019t care how hard they try\nHow far you hide\nI know where you live, what car you drive (Hahaha)\nThis ain\u2019t the start of the end\nYou gonna see Marcus again, there's no arguing friend\nI\u2019m gonna be given you prank calls from the pen\n\n[Deputy Doyle]\nYeah, right!\n\n[Chorus x3]\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you\nYou ain\u2019t got no privacy\nGirl you should feel like, somebody\u2019s watching you\nDon\u2019t be tryin to hide from me\n\n[Outro]\nBut I love you"

   "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nMr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams\nI'm the\nPillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce upon a time there was a boy named Mr. Pillowman\nHe had enough rage bottled inside to even kill a man\nAnd always went out of his way just so that he could get a friend\nHe'd ask for opportunities but nobody would give a damn\nAnd he would always hope he made it, cause he was so creative\nBut he was slowly hated going through these dopey mazes\nHe'd never hesitate whenever a test was given\nHe'd pass it with an A+ but get no recognition\nAt 19 years old he thought he caught his break\nAnd understood that patience and motivation is all it takes\nHis mother was so happy for him that she bought a cake\nI wish you could have seen the smile on his father's face\nTwo days after that, he was feeling lost and dazed\nThe man who was suppose to be his hookup was talking fake\nNow this is oftly strange, his world is cloudy as it softly rains\nAs he's crying out loud, his heart would sing...\n\n[Chorus]\nMr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams\nI'm the\nPillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem\n\n[Verse 2]\nMr Pillowman. Nothing but a civil man\nAlways felt that his success was just around the riverbend\nHe'd smile in your face but down in his heart he'd be sad\nThe world would never acknowledge half of the talents he had\n22 years old he thought he caught his break again\nBecause his buddy hooked him up, and it's for surely thanks to him\nThat Mr. Pilloman, is happy and so proud of his life\nWow this is nice, it's like he felt the power of Christ\nHe knew that God is good and God is bold, It's time to Rock and Roll\nSomebody finally understood he was a pot of gold\nHis lack of success was to the point where it's gotten old\nBut patience was the key, so the stories often told\n...Then his buddy called, and said \"I hate to tell you\nBut that connection that I hooked you up with never fell through\"\nThen Pillowman's like \"What the hell dude? You said this was a swell move\nI'm probably better off trying to sell shoes\"\n\n[Chorus]\nMr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams\nI'm the\nPillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere's a secret. I am Mr. Pillowman\nGoing on 25 and I'm wishing I could live again\nI've reached out to people but yet nobody would lend a hand\nI feel like i'll never be able to pay my rent again\nI'm getting old and time is crucial, feels like I'm not as useful\nMy only meals consist of Kool-aid, and Ramen noodles\n...I wish I had more, but my mom and dad's poor\nSo when you see me don't bother to ask me what I'm mad for\n..Yeah you can laugh about it. But I'm just sad and pouting\nSeeing motherfuckers make it who don't have no talent\nThat's 10 years of my life that's down the drain\nI feel like a true failure living life without a brain\nBut yo, I'm still trying to get a name\nRapping on the mic and spitting flames maybe i could get some change\nBut I'm at the point I'm about to say \"fuck it\"\nCause I released a nationwide album and I never made a buck from it\n\n[Chorus]\nMr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams\nI'm the\nPillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem"

Yo\nIt's kinda sad to see a fake ass Cassidy\nTrying to drastically murder me when you battle me\nHomie you're not the man you ain't even got no fans\nI beat you over the head with my mama's pots and pans\nYou shouldn't want to rhyme because the only fan you'll ever have is the one you cool off with in summer time\nYou pick me to battle, dog i'm the worst one\nI got your fuckin' mama wishing I was her son\nInstead of you i wish you would leave no residue\nI make a mess of you, You'll be needing treatment that's medical\nSo backing down from this battle is what you better do\nAh fuck it i'll show you how to wreck it dude\nYou put yourself in this situation you piece of shit you anus\nI'll rip you famous and i'll diss you back just to get YOU famous\nWhack mother fucker you can't even hit my ranges\nWhat's wrong didn't think Hopsin could come strong?\nHow you going to be a rapper, you only got one song\nI come with better art\nYour career is like a car with no battery\nHomie it ain't gonna ever start\nI'll shred apart your diss and fill your head with darts\nI'm hella smart whats happening dog? You fell apart?\nWell listen heres a big suggestion\nDon't come online when their disses present, it's a lesson\nBecause the only tight shit you've ever rapped\nWas a mother fuckin' christmas present bitch!\nYou diss my fan base? I'll sock your damn face and\nKick your knee caps in so you can't stand straight\nThis man's fake, now who's for that shit?\nCome on he has a fake New York accent\nLanguage you really thinking you at the top?

Your lazy ass don't commit to labor\nYou pick something up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later\nThen you complain about your life cause it ain't getting catered\nNow whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater\nYou wanna succeed, you have to try\nOr one day you'll get older and regret it all cause you can't provide\nYour friends are lowlifes, don't act surprised\nLook, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirls, stop acting like you want a guy with traits like Romeo\nBitch that's a fucking lie\nYou always talk about how every man's fake\nAnd you can't take it and you want something real\nShut up tramp, save it\nTwice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets\nAnd head to the club half-naked with your ass shaking\nPulling a lowlife nigga who claim he cash making\nTill you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station\nOne of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it\nBut you caused it, your actions made a fat statement\nYou want Romeo, then act patient\nAnd stop fronting like he in the club posted in the back waitin'\nIt's the club, where guys put on a new persona\nAfter they get loaded with a few coronas\nThey always shouting and wild out with habits that very few condone of\nThen they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em\nThen when they leave you, you cry and cry\nTalking 'bout, \"Oh my god I can't find a guy\nI've spent so many years and I've tried and tried\nWhy am I even on Earth? I should die\"\nYou want Romeo, you're not worthy\nYou're cock-thirsty\nYou're nasty and probably got herpes\nSometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching\nTry a new formula, cause your last one's not working\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe term \"real nigga\"'s publicly used\nAnd I need to know what it means, cause I'm fucking confused\nAre you one for always busting your tool\nWith nothing to lose and something to prove to homies up in your crew\nIs it because you're selling drugs to get loot\nAnd brag about how you done been shot and stabbed\nLike it's fun to be you\nBut your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustling through\nNah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop\nMan, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve\nCause you in the streets acting like a neanderthal\nIt's clear you can't stand the law, you're lost as an abandoned dog\nAnd all you're interested in is fighting, rapping, and basketball\nI can't even fuck with you, cause if we out in public\nYou gon' get caught stealing some shit and get my ass in trouble, too\nYou'll get old and be nothing\nLiving life in these streets, thugging and starting shit with anybody mean mugging\nLook at you, a real nigga, thinking your life's cool\nGirls used to turn me down for guys who were like you\nTill you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through\nThen they regret it because it wasn't the right move\nYour real nigga talk seems bogus\nA real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it\nAnd his future doesn't seem hopeless\nA real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit, and he keeps focused\n\n[Verse 4]\nTo all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong\nYou inspired the issue I wrote about in this song\nYou go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums\nSee this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums\nHope the hour's long when I'm rolling out with your tongue\nThe man above is my guide, you know the power is strong\nAll you menacing freaks are only in it for cheese\nAnd the mass control limit was breached - fuck hip-hop\nThey only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see\nThey purposely making the innocent weak\nMy existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me\nYo, we need to make a change while there's still time\nIt is hard, and sometimes I struggle trying to reveal mine\nI can guide you if you feel blind\nI just need you to be willing to journey into my ill mind"

   "lyrics": "[x16](Hopsin)\n\n[Verse 1: Hopsin]\nI'm a radical nuisance, and I'm back on my bullshit\nWent from lashing on ruthless to hanging rappers from nooses\nYou ain't gotta like me, but like a magnet and you stick\nBreaking these niggas was easy like snapping a toothpick\nYour whole gimmick's a fraud, you just casting illusions\nThat's how niggas get ran up on and cracked with a broomstick\nWatch what my promo does to your whole buzz, you're dead\nI don't show no love to homo thugs\nMy haters never show they face, they usually try to hide, but when they see me at my shows, I'm who they truly idolize. (I LOVE YOU!) I keep a handful of ugly groupies I deny, knowing if they ever showed up at my crib by surprise. (What the fuck?)\n\n[Verse 2: Jaylenz]\nNiggas gonna recognize, we the coldest niggas [?] shit\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Huh?)\nI been off for a minute, now I'm back in this bitch. I'm going off [?], bitch I been ripping this\n[Adlib:Hopsin](What?)\nAny minute and I'm with it, come and get it cause I been killing it\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Uh-huh)\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Get it)\n[Adlib:Hopsin](Oh)\n\n[x3](It is what it is)\n\n(I been up on this, I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[x2](It is what it is)\n\n(So bitch suck a dick, the kids busting sick. I'm a motherfucking selfish cat, quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[Verse 3: Jaylenz]\nYo, it is what it is, [?] for the kids\nBreak into your crib and stick a fucking pen through your rib\nI'll get you pinned to the fridge as I empty this clip into the cat and dog, and get to fucking busting like I'm jacking off\nI laugh it off when it comes to the thought of death and shit\nGot the angel and devil on my shoulder steady wrestlin'\nCheck inside your mom, you'll most likely find my specimen\nMy jizz will paint her face whiter than the forty second president\nQuietly evident, popping medicine just to get me off\n[?] and bungee jump with some dental floss\nHit from the back so hard, you see my penis is her jaws\nGo deeper and give birth to myself while she in menopause\nIt's probably my potty mouth that got you mad, cause I'm a motherfucking grouch hopping in trash, and smoke [?]'s ass\nMy dick's harder than jerking off with a doctor's cost, shot his ass, then hide in the same spot that 2Pac is at\n\n[x4](It is what it is)\n(I been up on this, I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[x2](It is what it is)\n(So bitch suck a dick, I been up on this. The kid's busting sick. I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)\n\n[x8](Suck a dick)\n\n(Hopsin)"

Please pay for me\"\nI make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding\nThen you can come inside like a hurricane warning\nI got a lot of sluts, I like to call Hopsin luck\nBut now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough\nI needed something new for moments when I gotta bust\nSo lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves\nI got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny?\nI'll stab you in the brain with a knife, you can keep that in mind\nYou talking shit inside your house? Cool, fine, fuck it\nI'll break in and stomp you out inside of it\nYeah, Hopsin"

Girl\nThese stab wounds multiply in your world\nYeah, they all plural\nI don't kill for the thrill, its for the nerds with the mills\nStill but no ladies to chill, its ill\nI don't find enjoyment, I find employment\nSlice a prostitute in the loins quick\nMoist grips, firmness, drooling from my lips\nSee the ripper can't be ripped, on his own shit\nSelf [??] yeah i ride my own dick\n\n[Chorus]\nSo in my mind we're fucking\nIn my mind we grinding\nIn my mind still unwinding\nI had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper\nIn my mind we grinding, grinding\nStill unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her\nSick like the ripper, the ripper"
