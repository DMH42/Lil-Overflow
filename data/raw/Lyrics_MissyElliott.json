  "plain": "Melissa Arnette Elliott, sometimes known Missy \u201cMisdemeanor\u201d Elliott, or just simply Missy Elliot, was born on July 1, 1971. Many consider Missy Elliott as the best female rapper of the mid-1990s and early-2000\u2019s. She began her musical career working in the all-female group Sista and later Swing Mob before beginning her solo career in 1997 with the release of her debut album Supa Dupa Fly. Supa Dupa Fly peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 1.2 million copies, giving Missy her first platinum certification.\n\nShe began the 2000s with three hit albums in a row, Miss E\u2026 So Addictive, Under Construction, and This Is Not a Test!. Missy has spent most of the last decade producing songs for other artists like Keyshia Cole, Jazmine Sullivan, and Monica."

Slim Shady)\nWon't you busa rhyme for me, boy?\n(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)\nWon't you busa rhyme for me, boy?\n(It's the ill, that cool?

Slim mothafucking Shady)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI had a huge attitude, started off staticky\nMad at you, had you mad at me automatically (One more time)\nI'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity\nWho oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following\nIt's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me (One, two)\nI'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology (Whoops)\nCollege girls, live in an alcoholic's world\nFull of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls\nCovered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up\nI won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (Shut up!)\nI made this rap game suspenseful\nCause now I got an impulse game to insult you wit a pencil (Bitch)\nThey waste the paper on you, chopping down the oakwood\nCause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good\nAnd as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'\nYou motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'\n\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Eminem, Missy)]\nWon't you busa rhyme for me, boy?\n(It's the ill, that cool? Slim Shady)\nWon't you busa rhyme for me, boy?\n(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)\nWon't you busa rhyme for me, boy?\n(It's the ill, that cool?

Get back\nUh, I'mma put you all in the line uh, and I'mma watch you MC's die\nYo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind\nI think somebody done pissed her off this time\nYeah, I'mma have to bus' you through your chest and\nUh, you gon' have to clean up the mess (Uh huh)\nIt's raining, raining and it's pouring loud\nNever fear, 'cause pissy Missy's through the crowd\nUh, I hear that the gats go cha-pow\nYou shot me dammit!

Always knew dat\nShe was hot as da nectar\nHector said he pecked her, disrespected her\n'Cause he bang bang, swang in his dingalang\nBroke his back long range\nAnd make the ugly bitch sing\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nCutie Tootie with her sight\nAnd if she humped Ralph\nShe humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike\nTight is the way she wore her dresses\nHas she learned her lesson\nFrom all the dick testing\nNow I'm guessing (Now I'm guessing)\nShe's laying in a casket, in a yellow basket\nFor a Gucci jacket\nDaggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things\n'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\n\n[Verse 3]\nTootie didn't know the facts of life\nStaying up in clinics, loosy bootie made trife\nFeeling, she got the heebie geebies\nQuick to give you freebies\nUnderneath the staircase in Brooklyn\nNeighbors out the window sure was lookin'\nShe greasy like chicken\nI don't give a cotton pick and\nShe can do her thing\n'Cause me and her don't hang\nThe ugly bitch sang\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nUh-huh\n\n[Outro]\nSo you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody\nWho's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank\nOnce again, going around humping everybody\nEverybody and anybody and anything\nThat's why you make the ugly bitch sing\nOoh, ooh"

Don't you know not to ever disturb a woman when she's cooking her favorite recipe?!\"\n\"Hey lady, look. This a jack move!\"\n\"Fried chicken, pork chops, chitlins, collard greens... What's wrong with you, eh? I have to get back to the kitchen. My cabbage is burning.\"\n\"Yeah, I want the cabbage and your collard greens. All of it. Right now.\"\n\"Besides, you're making me miss my favorite episode Fear Factor! I wonder if the ribs are done. You boys want to know chef's favorite recipe for musicals?\"\n\"I don't wanna know no chef recipe?! Go 'head. Get the pump! Gon' and get the pump.\"\n\"Well I tell you. You take a half a teaspoon of Mary J. and Ciara with a dash of Slick Rick.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, he gon' come back with the burner. Yeah, I'mma stick-- Yeah... Okay. Well, you play. Play!\" \"I'm back. Oh I'm back!\" \"Now what now!\"\n\"It's easy as 1-2-3 play. Next, you mix [?] Qu'ran in a Bangladesh style bowl to make some Nissan Stewart. Mix some Campbell's soup...\"\n\"And then???\"\n\"...I prefer Warryn style myself personally. Add a pinch of Fantasia...\"\n\"And THEN???\"\n\"...and a Grand sized Puba. You sprinkle one Scoop Fatman throughout to add flavor and a dab of Soul Diggaz. Then you throw a tablespoon of Timbaland and half a Neptune smothered in hot Scott Storch dressing.\"\n\"We gon' smother you in some hot sauce. Whatever you said.\"\n\"...and you serve with a side order of Mike Jones.\"\n\"Mike Jones?\" \"Who?\" \"Mike Jones!\"\n\"It's best served with a cold [?] brew, whichever you prefer. And there you have it kiddies. This is my perfect recipe for a delicious meal.

Blige, let 'em know this is not a test\nI hear you calling\n\n[Hook: Mary]\nWhat you hear is not a test\nI'm rocking to the beat (I'm rocking to the beat)\nSee me and my crew and my friends\nWe're gonna try to move your feet (move around, move around)\nSee I am Mary Blige (yes I am)\nAnd I'd like to say hello (thank you for inviting me)\nTo the black, to the white, the red and the brown\nThe purple and yellow (everybody)\nBut first you gotta, oh, but first you gotta"

Ghostface and Missy\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nSomebody tell that girl that her ass too big\nI give it to her right and she let me live\nCan't eat that, 'cause there's no relationship\nI beat that, the next day you called in sick\nFrontin', not for nothin', I pop buttons\nOff Baby Phat, Levi's, J.Lo's, Guess and Gap\nCause it's like that, young lady, bet I make you shake\nLike the Puffy and Jay-Z's, Dre's and J.D.'s\nCome on, if not you, I'ma beat this song\nBut if you were bout it, our business wouldn't be here this long\nLet me break it down for you, all I wanted to know\nIf I could just feel it and touch it, and break it down into numbers and\nCome with me and just leave your friends\nCause we don't need no cock blocking\nTellin' you this without no option\nTell your friends \"Peace, look, I'm bouncin'\"\n\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Ghostface Killah)]\nTush, tush, tush\nWant to slide in the bush, bush, bush?\n(I'm on top, you like push, push, push\nKeep it low like shush, shush, shush)\nYou want to get up in my tush, tush, tush?\nYou could slide in the bush, bush, bush\n(I'm on top, you like push, push, push\nKeep it low like shush, shush, shush)\nYou want to get up in that tush, tush, tush?\nWant to slide in my bush, bush, bush\n(I'm on top, you like push, push, push\nKeep it low like shush, shush, shush)\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nOh yeah, you jinglin' baby (well let me jump up on that ding-a-ling baby)\nOoh, gosh, you a nasty girl, sassy\nPicture me layin' you inside my classic pearls\nToes'll curl, giddy up, you go girl\nI'm about to, uh, do it slow girl\nOoh, you in control, it's in your world\nShe on, I think I like ol' girl\nTake it out, turn around\nCharlie horse, shit, threw me off balance\nWildin', all I wanted was to show you my talent\nTo let you know on how I rep in Staten Island\nThis is the reason I came to you\nSo we can connect it then kick it was the thing to do\nCause we don't need no representation\nDomination, got them waitin' patient\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nNow this is the way y'all suppose to\nTo get down, y'all ain't right\nSomebody say \"Aha! Ghost is back!\"\n\n[Missy Elliott]\nPull back the curtain, let me work your sermon\nPlayboy don't hurt me like a virgin\nYou seem real determined to put a hurtin'\nBut if you ain't slurpin', then you better off jerkin'\nYou got a lot of nerve, to want to serve my curves\nMy 36D, 36 hips\nThe way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles\nAnd you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips\nEh, I really like you baby\nDo you know how to wife this lady?\nGive me what I want, don't talk, don't touch\nUnless you got a bank account that make my face blush\nNow shush, in my bush\nAnd I can give you what you want, make a whoosh\nJust throw it, I'll show you how to push\nKinky sex, tie ropes around your wrist\nCome on\n\n[Chorus]\n[Missy Elliott]\nCome on\nCome on\nOh\nCome on!"

Here I come, better run take what's mine\nAbout to let off like a tech nine\nThis rhyme gon' make 'em push rewind\nYeah I'm so hot\nUp on the charts, number one spot\nSee me when I drop and I won't flop\nMissy never stop got the music game on lock\nWhen I get served\nYou third, you second but I come first\nFlip my verse like I flip birds\nI'm fine, Yes Sir\n\n(Chorus)\nWe hitmakin', hitbreakin', party shakin', innovating\nGroundbreakin', sole creatin'. We be the most anticipated\nHitmakin', hitbreakin', party shakin', innovating\nGroundbreakin', sole creatin'. We be the most anticipated\n\n(2nd Verse - Timbaland)\nNow I'm in the 9th inning\nN***** think I fail when I'm still winnin'\nSo I've been gone for a hot minute\nI love this shit, that's why I gotta gift in it\nF*** n***** get fly\nN**** can't talk with a gun in his mouth\nN****s b**** up and they run in their house\nI can smell bulls*** when they walk by\nHeard that old saying yo\n\"Never ever cross a one day, give ya most\"\nNever ever act funny for the white folk\nI'm a big fish remember you a tadpole\nI like Lady Gaga. Why you let a n**** do your whole album?\nWhere you think that fake producer got ya style from?!\nCome f*** with a n****, watch the outcome\nAin't no real artists\nWack talent get in, real starvin'\nAll you hear in music is a chorus\nWell that's okay Timmy back in the story\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(During Chorus - Missy Elliot)\nY'all can't be serious\nWe break records, I done told y'all\nHow many of y'all got a catalogue this long?\nDon't worry, I'll wait!\n\n(3rd Verse - Missy Elliot)\nDown to the 9th inning\nI'm the real deal, y'all pretendin'\nYears later my songs still spinnin'\nI do record deals no less than ten milli\nMy hits be yay long\nMy songs go on like a marathon\nGet ghost, get gone, you a dum-dum\nBetter round here, come on biters like a python\nWhen I act fly\nWhen I act like you better than a M-I\nShakin' em, bakin' em all like a bean pie\nTakin' em, burnin' em down like I'm left Left Eye\nFuturistic\nY'all can pack it up, I done ripped it\nWhen you say my name call me Miss Bitch\nI make the next chick run to the exit\nYeah I got a Sixth Sense\nI'm makin' this a movie like a Netflix\nI'm on the guest list, on the check list\nI'm the flyest chick, now tell me who the best is?!\nElliot be the name\nElliot back in the game\nElliot hit 'em with a BANG!\nBring the hook back in Timbaland\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Missy Elliot during chorus)\nDid y'all forget?! I think they forgot!\nThey think we done\nAll we do is make hits?!\n\n(Outro - Missy Elliot)\nAnd if you want a hit? Maybe we'll return your call\nDon't call collect\n(Operator Voice)\nYou have a collect call from... (Dial Tone)"
