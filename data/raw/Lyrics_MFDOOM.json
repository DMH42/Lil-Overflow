  "plain": "The best MC with no chain ya ever heard!\n\nMF DOOM is an English-born American underground hip hop artist, best known for his \u201csuper villain\u201d stage persona and unique lyrics and lyrical abilities.\n\nBorn Daniel Dumile, in 1988 he formed the group K.M.D.\u2014which stands for \u201cKausing Much Damage\u201d\u2014with his brother, DJ Subroc. At the time, his stage name was Zev Love X. KMD was eventually signed to Elektra after some minor hype, and they released one album titled Mr. Hood. Before the release of their second album, Black Bastards, Subroc was struck and killed by a car in 1993.\n\nAfter his brother\u2019s death, Dumile quit rapping and lived on benches for three years. He soon began rapping underground with his now iconic mask:\n\n\n\nThe mask was based on a prop mask from the film Gladiator. In 1998, DOOM told Ego Trip, \u201cit\u2019s music we\u2019re selling, not my face.\u201d\n\nYou can see how DOOM\u2019s mask changed through the years here!\n\nDumile then adopted the identity MF DOOM, based on Marvel supervillian Doctor Doom\u2014whose name is always spelled in all capital letters in the comic books, which is why you always spell MF DOOM in all caps!\n\nJust remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name\n\nAlthough, he told an interviewer that the name was actually a nickname from his mother:\n\nYeah and for the record I didn\u2019t get the idea from [Doctor Doom]\u2026 [laughs]. I been Doom ever since I was born, my momma call me Doom so\u2026\n\nIn 1999, DOOM released his debut solo album, Operation: Doomsday. The album had three singles: \u201cDead Bent,\u201d \u201cOperation: Greenbacks,\u201d and \u201cThe M.I.C.\u201d\n\nFor his next album, Take Me To Your Leader, DOOM introduced a new moniker, King Geedorah. After that, he released Vaudeville Villain and Venomous Villain under the moniker Viktor Vaughn.\n\nIn 2004, under the name MF DOOM, he released MM.. FOOD\u2014an anagram of M.F. DOOM. His last solo album, Born Like This, mostly fell under the radar, but is nonetheless a solid project. It spawned multiple classic songs, such as \u201cGazzillion Ear,\u201d \u201cBallskin\u201d and the lyrically inclined \u201cThat\u2019s That.\u201d\n\nDOOM received critical acclaim for his 2004 collaboration with producer Madlib, Madvillainy. With a 93/100 score on Metacritic, and praise from hip-hop legends, Madvillainy is known as one of the best rap albums of all time. DOOM told an interviewer why he likes collaborations:\n\n\nIt just makes it fun cos there\u2019s another person there with another artistic point of view. If it\u2019s a producer it makes my job easier, I don\u2019t have to think about the beat and the rhyme which is kinda tricky. I can let them have their vision with the beat and then do my rhyme. Let them mix the song, see it how they see it and maybe change one or two things, but it makes it good.\n\nI love collaborating, I\u2019m a team player. I love it when I\u2019m working with other artists and see how they get down and exchanging ideas, it\u2019s fun.\n\n\nDuring his rap career, DOOM has used a plethora of aliases and monikers:\n\n\nMF DOOM\nDOOM\nMetal Face DOOM\nViktor Vaughn\nKing Geedorah\nMetal Fingers\nZev Love X (with the group K.M.D.)\n\nMadvillain (with Madlib)\n\nDANGERDOOM (with Danger Mouse)\n\nDOOMSTARKS (with Ghostface Killah)\n\nJJ DOOM (with Jneiro Jarel)\n\nNehruvianDOOM (with Bishop Nehru)\n\n\n\nLuckily, Genius has a tag that houses all of DOOM\u2019s aliases, monikers, and collaborations here.\n\nEach of DOOM\u2019s characters have their own personas and he explores the meaning behind these various personas in an interview at the Red Bull Music Academy:\n\nThe idea of having different characters is really to get the storyline across. The idea of having one different character all the time, to me, makes \u2013 to me \u2013 the story boring\u2026 So the more, the better with me. This way I could come from one point of view, another point of view. They might even disagree on certain things. I think a lot of times, especially in hip-hop, artists get pigeonholed into being, \u201cYou\u2019re the guy.\u201d It\u2019s kind of limiting in a way. I look at it like I\u2019m the writer. Same way with the skits. Have the record tell the story\n\nAbout the main character DOOM in particular:\n\nHe\u2019s more like the old-school, OG, old-timer villain. He\u2019s the typical villain you\u2019d have in any story. A lot of people misunderstand him, but he\u2019s always looked at as the bad guy, but really he\u2019s got a heart of gold. He\u2019s for the children. He\u2019s like a Robin Hood kind of character.\n\nAlso an established (and amazing) producer, DOOM has released multiple compilation albums of his beats, like the Special Herbs series. He spoke about his producing/songwriting process in the same interview\n\n\nWhat I usually do when I\u2019m producing a record, I\u2019ll come up with the beat first\u2026 And then the beat will inspire the lyrics, you know what I\u2019m sayin'? So, in that particular example [\u201cBeef Rapp\u201d] that was the main song, that song defined the record, [\u2026] so I came up with that particular song first. Everything else spawned from there.\n\nI heard the loop first, cut the loop, put the drums to it, polish it up with the 808s, but I don\u2019t really over-do it too much\u2026 I like to try to keep it as close to the original as possible. Leave something for the imagination, but enough to get the translation across. Then just write to it, keep it simple.\n\n\nUsing his JJ DOOM collaboration album as an example, DOOM explained the process behind his iconic, obscure TV dialogue samples and skits:\n\n\nQ: The way the sampling works on the album, specifically the intro, skits and the use of vocal snippets throughout, that really reminds me of you. It reminds me of the King Geedorah project for example. Was that part of the album something you looked after?\n\nYeah I definitely\u2026 well you know we spoke about it like \u2018it definitely needs to have skits on it\u2019 and JJ would be like \u2018yo DOOM you need to put some skits on there\u2019 and I was like \u2018yeah I got some stuff, I got some stuff\u2019. But I had to wait until the last minute because collecting these voices is not as easy as it sounds [laughs]. I gotta watch hours and hours of old vintage footage, listen to hours and hours of lectures.\n\nI\u2019m sleeping while playing this shit, listening, and then in the third hour of some long lecture it\u2019ll say the right word. So then it\u2019s like \u2018oh shit there it is!\u2019 Wake up and look at the timer, note the time when it happened and go back to sleep. When I wake up I\u2019ll find it again and chop it and put it in. It\u2019s a real tedious process, but as I\u2019m writing songs I\u2019m collecting pieces, and I\u2019m collecting pieces that pertain to the songs, and then I condense them and make the story. I like to put an intro so people get a feel for what\u2019s going on. It sets the tone, almost like scenery.\n\n\nYou might wonder how he finds all of these samples, and he talked about that too:\n\n\nQ: I remember reading in a previous interview that you\u2019d spent hours collecting stuff, I think you were talking about King Geedorah again. So despite having done that for years, and I\u2019m assuming collecting a fairly sizeable library of samples, you\u2019re still at it?\n\nYup, yup. It\u2019s entertaining, you know? I don\u2019t watch TV but I do that all day. I be cleaning the house and playing some obscure, weird shit. And it\u2019ll be fun stuff, I bump into some interesting things.\n\n\nAn old-fashioned man, DOOM doesn\u2019t have any social media accounts. His verified Twitter account only has one tweet: \u201cDOOM IS NOT ON TWITTER.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey got the Facebook site, but it\u2019s more like a fan site. I never looked at this shit. I\u2019m not on Twitter. I\u2019m trying to get a old beeper matter of fact, a sky pager. I\u2019m trying to go back to that, do the upside down texting. I\u2019m old school, so I keep it to the way it was. I like to stay\u2026 it keeps me focused.\n\nI think a lot of that stuff over sensitises everything. You get lost. It\u2019s noise, like \u2018ka ka ka ka ka\u2019. [\u2026] People get caught up in what other people think about them, so much. But what do you think about yourself? Do you think about yourself as much as what you think other people are thinking about you? So\u2026 that\u2019s something that should be\u2026"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Sade, MF DOOM]\nMic Check\nWhen I was led to you\nI knew you were the one for me\nCome through dig the sound\nI swear the whole world could feel you MC\nCrowd around\n\n[Verse 1: MF DOOM]\nI used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop\nHold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot\nStop and stick around, come through and dig the sound\nOf the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around\nBound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap\nIt's a intricate plot of a b-boy strap\nFemstat cats get kidnapped\nThen release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that\nMetal Fist terrorists claim responsibility\nBroken household name usually said in hostility\nUm... what is MF? You silly\nI'd like to take \"Means to the End\" for two milli'\n\"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!\" That's a audio daily double\nRappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo\nWatch your own back came in and go out alone, black\nStay in the zone\u2014turn H2O to Cognac\n\n[Hook: MF DOOM]\nOn Doomsday!, ever since the womb \u2018til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say\nRight above my government; Dumile\nEither unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?\n\n[Verse 2: MF DOOM]\nI wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section\nIf you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then\nCell number 17, up under the top bunk\nI say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk\nPop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped\nGod forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape\nDefinition \"super-villain\": a killer who love children\nOne who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building\nWhile Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer\nI'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer\nA pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime\nDo his thing, ring around the white collar crime\nGet out my face, askin' \u2018bout my case, need toothpaste\nFresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent\nAnd dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness\nReal mens mind their own business\nThat's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch\nHow come I hold the microphone double-clutch\nC.O.'s make rounds, never have \u2018ox found\nOn shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown\n\n[Hook: MF DOOM]\nOn Doomsday!\nEver since the womb \u2018til I'm back where my brother went\nThat's what my tomb will say\nRight above my government; Dumile\nEither unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?\n\n[Bridge: MF DOOM]\nDoomsday\nEver since the womb \u2018til I'm back to the essence\nRead it off the tomb\nEither engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?\n\n[Verse 3: MF DOOM]\nPass the mic like \"Pass the peas like they used to say\"\nSome M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk\nI'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk\nNever let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang\nNicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang. metal fang\nKnown amongst hoes for the bang-bang\nKnown amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans\nOnly gin and Tang\nGuzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang\nClang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth\nIt's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth\nI took her back to the truck, she was uncouth\nSpittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth\nBut then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce\nSo I turned it up faster than a speeding knife\nStrong enough to please a wife\nAble to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life\nCut the crap far as rap\nTouch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing\nWhat the Devil? He's on another level\nIt's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!\n\n[Outro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl & MF Doom]\nWhen I\nDoomsday\nCheck the sound\nRight around was led to you\nI knew you were the one for me\nI swear the whole world could feel you MC"

How am I gonna do this man?\nYeah don't wait for her man, don't wait for her\nI'll tell you what man: come with me now and you know\nI'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something\nI got a little bank, y'know, no problem\nI hear you, that's cool (Alright? It's cool)\nMan, can't you guys just wait here about a half hour, man?\nYo I'll be back man, I'm just gonna munch up a little bit man, I'm pretty hungry\nYo let him come back\n\n[Skit 2]\nHere you will find food for your body\nAs well as comfort for your troubled mind\nI'd really like some soup (Bread and butter)\nOf course my friend. What happened to your hand?\nOh, food at last!\n\n[Skit 3]\nHow did they get here?\nRegular storage procedure, the same as the other food\nWhat other food?\nFish (Food) protein (Fast for ya)\n\n[Skit 4]\nNow what happened?\nWell, the cop got\nThe next morning I went to the store to get some food\n(Bread and butter) They arrested me\nI'll save you (Thank you)\nWould you like a snack?\nThanks for the drink\n\n[Skit 5]\nOperation Doomsday complete\nAll your intercoms casualty and damage testing\n\n[Skit 6]\nEnough! you talk of the people's rights\nThe people have only those rights which I choose to give them\nAnd that's for their own good, believe me\nI do, DOOM\nThey disappoint me, they must work faster\nBut the prisoner-\nAh yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me\nWatch him. I have special plans for that one\n\n[Verse 1]\nBeef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped\nOr even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap\nI suggest you change your diet\nIt can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it\nOr even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease\nIt ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze\nTake the easy way out phony, until then\nThey know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen\nSo disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this\nThey talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice\nBust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet\nTwo batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it\nHe be better off on PC glued\nAnd it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood\nEvery week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed\n(Food, we need food!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh\nA rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous\nDrop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit\nThey need it like a hole in they head or a third tit\nHer bra smell, his card say, \"Aw Hell!\"\nBarred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel\nKeep a cooker where the jar fell\nAnd keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell\nTop bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears\nStop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares\nThe odd pair swears and God fears\nEven when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years\nI wrote this note around New Year's\nOff a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares?\nEnough about me, it's about the beats\nNot about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat\nA rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical\nWhether is it animal, vegetable or mineral\nIt's a miracle how he get so lyrical\nAnd proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual\nFor a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello\nTell them devils hell no, sell y'all own Jello\nWe hollow krills, she swallow pills\nHe follow flea collar three dollar bills\nAnd squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal\nDig the real, it's how the big ballers deal\nTwirl a L after every meal (Food!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up\nAnd keep a shirt on, at least a button-up\nYuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?\nOut of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales\nThey chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales\nLet alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales\nThis one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail\nDippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale\nLight the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby\nAfter which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby\nHe's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit\nOverproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?\nPunk, try and ask why ours be better\nCould be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater\nYes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude\n(We need food!)"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nBefore we go any further\nFriends\n\n[Verse]\nAs you call 'em, they call you when they need something\nTrees for the blunt, the G's for the front\nI found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone\nTurn a deaf ear to the cellular phone\nSend me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life\nJust so you could feel me like a steel knife\nAt least so you could see the white of they eyes\nBright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies\nAsssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies\nClose, but really don't know me\nMom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies\nSome come around when they need some money\nOthers make us laugh like the Sunday funnies\nFam be around whether you paid or bummy\nYou could either ignore this advice or take it from me\nBe too nice and people take you for a dummy\nSo nowadays he ain't so friendly\nActually they wouldn\u2019t have made a worthy enemy\nRead the signs: \"No feeding the baboon\"\nSeein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds\nY'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance\nTry to put 'em on, they blow the chance\nNever let your so-called mans know your plans\n(How many of us have them?) A show of hands\n(Friends) is a term some people use loosely\nI'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see\nYou telling me; I try to act broke\nJealousy the number one killer among black folk\nFellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke\nGhetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc\nJust another way a chick'll lead to your end\nI check the dictionary for the meaning of friend\nIt said: person, one who likes to socialize with\nSympathiser, helper, and that's about the size of it\nMost of the time these attributes is one-sided\nTo bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid\nAnd they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch\nSometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch\n(Click!) And when things get quiet\nCatch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot\nI first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal\nDon't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel\nWhen it get for real, steel get to sparkin'\nEverything darken, and ain't no talkin'\nFor somethin so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble\nYa better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble\nOr else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is\n(One's we can depend on, friends)\nSome come in the form of codependence\nA lot of times only end up being codefendants\nTen bucks say they tell for a lower sentence\nAnd leave you up under the jail, begging for a penance\nIt don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?\nHonor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty\nI'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory\n(How many of us have--) a similar story\n(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing\nJust so when I let her get the man thing, she know it's no strings\nWe could do the damn thing, but ho, it's no rings\nJust how the tramp swings\nWill she see 'em again?\nThat depends on how good was the skins and could she memorize the lessons\nIt ain't no need to pretend\nEven though she let 'em stab it, she know they're just friends\n\n[Outro]\nFriends\nHow many of us have them?\nFriends\nOnes we can depend on?\nFriends\nHow many of us have them?\nFriends\nBefore we go any further\n\n[Skit]\nFellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are!\nAnd the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get crack'\n(Negro humor always escaped me.)\n\n[Outro Skit: Character 1; Mr. Fantastic; (Invisible Woman);\nDr. DOOM; Character 2]\nThe most powerful, the most mysterious monarch in all the world\nGuided by a fighting force that never sleeps\nThat never relaxes its vigilance\nFor none is as feared, none has as many foes\nAs DOOM, the awesome ironclad lord of\nI know who Doom is (Then tell us)\nHe happens to be the most dangerous man in the world\nI\u2019d hope we\u2019d never hear from him\nI\u2019d hope we\u2019d never have to battle him\nBut now the worst has happened and I must tell you what we\u2019re up against\nI first met DOOM years ago\nWhen he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments\nOne day while conducting a secret experiment\n[Explosion sounds] Later, when he recovered from his injuries\nInstead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful\n[Woman screams] What have I done to myself?\nMy face, it is hideous\nHe traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face\n(I\u2019m sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you)\nHe traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen\nHe continued his search, never showing his face\nUnless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers\nWho foolishly wander alone through their domain"

About to throw 'em away\nWith the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ\nUsually I take them off with Oil of Olay\nMCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay\nHot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?\nWorking on a way that we can roll away tinted\nSome say the price of holding heat is often too high\nYou either be in a coffin or you be the new guy\nThe one that's too fly to eat shoo pie\nNever too busy when it comes down to you and I\n(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die\nThey need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry\nYou're on the list, if not, pick a number spot\nTen and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat\nI coulda had a V-8\nF-150 quad cab but I'll be straight\nMoney comes and goes like that two bit hussy\nThat night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie\nSo I can calm down so they don't get it twisted\nTake it from the fire side, it won't get blistered\nGot it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit\nThese metal fingers be holding (hot shit)\n\n[Verse 3: Count Bass D]\nWhen I was four, I penned \"God Was Born In New York\"\nBack in '77, still got nan in the crescent\nThe effervescence of God's presence is thick\nUnlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker\nPeace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers\nLooked her up and down said, \"Hmm, too much makeup\"\nPoor music taste, ten years from being grown up\nRappers don't blow up heads do (aww shit)\nMy name is Dwight Spitz, I'mma Sonic addict\nI use to think it was merely a nagging habit\nBorn under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine\nI strive to flip it into fine wine\nBarely born a virgin is what the stars said\nBlack not white, red all over though like Elmo\nTwenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking\nI make music every weekend\nIt's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love\nI get mad love but I detest the labor\nAnd its wages, you know death\nI'm servin' life from this gift of God\nDon't forget your potholders, my niggas (more hot shit)\n\n[Outro]\nA short time later"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's horrible, one little evening alone, home\nEnd up with carpal tunnel syndrome\nAnd here I am, known for giving heavy back aches\nGrown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes\nSupposed to be checking emails\nAll I got is messages from ass naked females\nI don't know a Jenny\nShe said it's free and I won't owe her a penny\nAnd that's the last time I saw her\nBut thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah\nAnd Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out\nAnd they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts\nI wonder what I owe her\nFor a whole box of caramel coconut samoa\n(\"Nite nite!\"), Uh, ok honey, sweet dreams\nNow it's time to get serious like Peek Freans\nA metal handful, wipe it on the quilt\nWife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk\nLocked in, looking at your picture\nFully clothed winter and I'm right there with ya\nThinking about the last time I split your wishbone\nA man could only wish you do the same 'til he get home\nFat chance, at least he get snacks\nThat'd have to do 'til a brother get back\nUntil then smack One-Eyed Jack\nAnd hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack\nThat's three different flavors\nChocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers\nActing all hard, 'bout to get beat up\nI'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up\nSoon as he fell off the beat down\nAll I hear is, \"13th cell, put the sheet down\"\nDamn C.O., what the hell do she know?\nBesides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low\nA workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen\nOut in the mountains and I stopped drinking again\nIn the wee hours, he's gotten farther\nNeeding three showers, being hot and bothered\nThe wiz with her legs bent, pregnant\nGod bless the day she wondered where her egg went\nI need a L, it's hard to drink without it\nAnd could use some kookies but trying not to think about it\nWatching \"BET\" on jazz for knowledge on file\nEvery other commercial, college hoes gone wild\nSoft batch, I prefer the other bunch\nLike we got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe don't mess with the Ritz Bits\nWheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits\nMatzos or Cheez-Its\nCatch sugar fits every time that he sees\nChips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk\nSomething with the bubble and the junk in the trunk\nEven the Oreos, no matter what weather\nAlways kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together\nIn the game he's shameless\nEven uses a code name: Famous Amos\nIt's cheaper than a short stay at the Days Inn\nAnd good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin\nGive a hand to who invented the camera\nSkip past the graham, animal and Grandma\u2019s\nShh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill\nOr get caught with a handful of cream fill\n\n\"Oh, honey! What are you doing? That's so nasty!\"\nIt might seem ill\n\"Ew! Go wash your hands!\" (No)\nKookies\n\"Get out of here!\"\n\n[Outro: Samples]\n\"DOOM is master of the world.\"\n\"I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book.\"\n\"You've disturbed me for the last time.\"\n(Voice 1): Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't really all bad\n(Voice 2): What do you mean, Ben?\n(Voice 1): Well I gotta admit that I've been having a real good time. Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black\n(Voice 3): Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack us once more and send you back, Benjamin\n(Voice 1): Ah-haha very funny, very very funny\n(Voice 2): He must be mad\n(Voice 4): Well, if anyone can do it. Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can\n(Misc. Voice): Food, we need food"

In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing\nPulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain\nMaintain and say it, don't spray it\nYou wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it\nIf I had a dime for every rhymer that bust guns\nI'll have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds\nWhen I was broker than a broke dick dog\nI always kept a L to smoke in thick fog\nWhen it rain, it sure do thunderstorm\nI got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms\nOne, two, microphone checker\nFirst learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker\nThis is back when he was like crib age\nWhen he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage\nBreak the mic like a rock star break a guitar\nAnd jump off the stage like \"Yee haw!\"\n\n[Outro Skit]\n(UN leader): We shall now vote for a new world leader.

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nIf you're waiting for a parade, there ain't none\nSharpen up your spirit of adventure, the fabulous gay way\nHey, what's the big idea? (Yeah!)\nI have no ideas, in fact, I'm quite bewildered\nNow don't get gay with me\n(Gay? Sir, I'm far from gay)\nNow listen and keep your shirt on\nGrown men in a rubber suit, runnin' around with a young boy\n(Homo)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOh shoot, get a load of that fruit\nIn thigh-high boots, red tighty-whities and blue cat suit\n(Holy homos!) Even the rats know it\u2019s tacky\n\"You ever see me slippin' like that bitch, just smack me\"\nPosin' Chester, legs open, couldn\u2019t stand worse\nAll was missin' was a bandana and a man purse\nCryin', dyin', laughin' 'til glands burst\nFaster than a speeding glass, bleeding-ass ran first\nFixin' baby hair, messed up wavy curl\nUnder the cape the back of the S say baby girl\nThe things some people\u2018ll do for fame\nIt\u2019s an herb, it\u2019s a lame, it's, a Goddamn shame\nVillain willing when them cold streets call\nYou can keep your hero and hold the meatballs\nWorthy title, lock it with pockets on empty\nHe work harder than a steam engine like John Henry\nTurn dirt to dollars like Don Henley\nUgly and still get hollers like Ron Jeremy\nAt least monetarily terribly\nMC's need therapy, it\u2019s like a fairy spree\nHit him with a kryptonite brick (Kryptonite)\nChildren come and prick his dead body with a stick\nWrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick\nShe had the tightest grip around the head of my\n\n[Interlude]\nHow much money you got?\nI ain't got but four dollars on me\nDamn\nAnyway I don't got this whole (censored) for ya\nShit, you must be some kind of faggot man\nMy partner a faggot, why don't you come on out here man?\nMan, what the hell?\n\n[Verse 2]\n...Bic, now can I get my pen back\nGot no enemy, got no friend, black\nWith the Green Goblin got the Batcave robbed\nBust in Batman\u2019s head bobbin\u2019, slobbin\u2019 Robin\u2019s knob\nY'all already got your belts on the floor so\nKick them shits over here and click off the porno\nAlfred come home, and found them both naked\nHandcuffed to each other just as he had suspected\nRed and chrome Batmobile, wheelin\u2018 and dealin\u2019\nAquaman's sleepin' with the fishes for real for squealin\u2019\nPsst! The lo-lo on a seal skin blazer\nIt\u2019s just a little graze from a razor-thin laser\nAmazed at all these so-called wannabe players\nShowin' off they titballs to all the free-gayers\nIt\u2019s like a leotard fest\nHow it got started is any retard's guess\nRegardless, that\u2019s they choice, no hate debate\nBecomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight\nAnd raise the monster rate in the whole population\nIt\u2019s starting to affect the super pimpin' occupation\nNow who\u2019s the hater? Headline the newspaper\nFate of a fake you out caped crusader\nTied to the tracks, make a damn tram derail\nRap is like scam spam Nigerian e-mail\nThe man with no beard is more weirder than a she-male\nSucker got bagged on a Temazepam street sale\nTold 'em one of ours set it up, yeah doubt\nDid it like the dirty drawls, wet \u2018em up and air it out\n\n[Outro]\nYou got any money? (What?)\nListen, you got any money?\nMan you goin' crazy? What the hell for?\nFour dollars only, damn\nBatman's gay (batty boys)"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Charles Bukowski]\nBorn like this, into this\nAs the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs\nAs political landscapes dissolve\nAs the oily fish spit out their oily prey\nWe are born like this, into this\nInto hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die\nInto lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty\nInto a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed\nInto a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes\nBorn into this, walking and living through this\nDying because of this\nCastrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this\nThe fingers reach toward an unresponsive God\nThe fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder\nWe are born into this sorrowful deadliness\nThere will be open and unpunished murder in the streets\nIt will be guns and roving mobs, land will be useless\nFood will become a diminishing return\nNuclear power will be taken over by the many\nExplosions will continually shape the earth\nRadiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men\nThe rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind\nAnd there will be the most beautiful silence never heard\nBorn out of that, the sun hidden there\nAwaiting the next chapter\n\n[Verse 1: DOOM]\nDOOM from the realm of El Kulum, smelly gel fume\nSeparating cell womb to Melle Mel, boom\nRevelations in Braille, respiration inhale, view\nNations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due\nBlazing swords trace the haze, praise the Lord\nSaving Grace, lace your broad, she say she bored\nA crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin\nCandy corn crap rappers pale by comparison\nA bad samaritan averaging above average men\nRancid rants having rambling savages scavenging\nFor scraps, perhaps road kill if that\nGift of gab and he flowed ill, chrome stiff hat\nKnown for writing lightning tight lines, chiefin'\nBeefin', being off deep ends, divine bright shines even\nDimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine\nSlight rewind, tightly bind, blind lead blind\nNeed mines now that was this is then, listening\nTo sizzling officialtons whispering, \"Him again\"\nMetal Face Finster playing with the dirty money\nSinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny\nMajor vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet\nSave your breath, gave a F, pay your debt, they forget\nMake her sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits\nThen it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates\n\n[Interlude]\nThree thousand years ago, Moses said:\n\"Every human being is responsible for his actions\nOr thy being is still a beast, not yet human!\"\n\n[Verse 2: DOOM]\nYou ought to let your uncle flow, my motorcyle trunk fulls\nFrom two-one two-one, lose crumbs to trunks in bundles\nHands down, better than what your mans used to get\nStanding around from where the translucent looses spit\nMissing wheel, you don't listen, you're a feel head\nSitting in the kitchen pissing, twitching, kissing steel lead\nCrime pays no dental nor medical\nUnless you catch retirement, county, state or federal\nYou heard like roaring waters in a seashell\nIf a tree fell, you couldn't tell from three cell\nBe real careful, they tell him by the earful\nKids doing skid bids, acting out is terrible\nWord is bond, fix your clothes, put a shirt on\nPants sagging back when you used to meant you had a skirt on\nSquirts posing as thuggers and hustlers\nEl Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers\nMotherfuckers!\n\n[Outro]\nDOOM is transmitting a message to you\nSuper fools\nI need to use more power"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI remember when, last past November when\nClown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands\nThey left him trembling, he was not remembering:\nNever tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem\nSome would debate, \"Wait, the fella ate gelatin\nOr he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him\"\nWhen I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling\nUs to break them off, no reassembling\nNo science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to\nFuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do\nYou could gather 'round like it was an eclipse\nJust don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts\nPass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails\nAll hail, King Geedorah, the third rail\n700 volts holds rap to a standstill\nFool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed\nTwo bottles of Dom got his hands filled\nAnd so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill\nAnd built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze\n(And the lights went down and hey!)\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I knew it was the last day - Wig-Twisting Season\nWhen some could get their wigs twisted back within reason\nMostly with these crimes of treason\nAnd you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick\nHe's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick\nHe's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back\nCouldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack\nIt don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple\nCause you could have a chick with D-Triple\n'Cept the nipple little. Just hot off the griddle\nLike how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self\nAin't no average MC ahead of me\nGetting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree\nWith nicknames, sick games as Rick James\nMessy games, sci-fly such as Jesse James\nBlast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker\nLast one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker\nGot bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up\nBail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up\nMy only backup was an A-cup, as far as May\nTo when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday\nAll else? Worthless to say\n(And the lights went down and hey!)\n\n[Hook]\nThat's when I knew it was the first day - Wig-Twisting Season\nWhen some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning\nMostly with these crimes of treason men\nAnd y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act\nI been bent back since my Physical went back\nSince, Cultured more of my kin\nAnd for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole\nHold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold\nIn the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold\nTo 'round Nimrod release day\nAnd all else? Needless to say\nWait a motherfucking minute! True facts presented\nThe names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it\nThe XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted\nThe way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted\n\n[Hook]\nWig-Twisting Season\nWhen some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning\nMostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating\nAll types of different styles of treason"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: MF Doom]\nAs the life cycle goes on ... goes on\nAnd you learn to hold on (hold on)\nTo things like the mic ... the mic\nAnd you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device\nBut who is (The finest)\n\n[Verse 1: Tommy Gunn + MF Doom]\nTommy Tashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor\nTime and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor\nTommy Tashuma, no time for humor\nAs soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead, you trying to find Pumas\nSooner the better, even knitted a sweater already\nKeep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather\nWe ready to do whatever, yo' Doom you with it?\nYou know it like a poet, my brother\nHey, Gunn you wit it? Whatever... [the finest!]\n\n[Verse 2: MF Doom]\nI know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off\nTo bust a shell off, to dick-riders: \"Get the hell off\"\nMade a call to a client, he must've had his cell off\nA show-off, he has the same bike Puff fell off\nI tell off the bat, from science to pure facts\nWhich niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks\nMatter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell\nThe tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell\n\n[Verse 3: Tommy Gunn]\nWhen die, he gon' die like a soldier die:\nHolding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold\nSmoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach\nBlowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die\nHe gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky\n\n[Verse 4: MF Doom]\nYup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup\nThis one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up\nI need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up\nNiggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up\n\n[Verse 5: Megalon]\nStands up and hold 'em high, do or die\nHe got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes\nGot the weed, rolling lah\nNot sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply\nWithin the prophecies hold the lie\n\n[Verse 6: MF Doom]\nHe bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me, OD\nGhetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me\nA OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed me\nSci-Fly, whole style stuck up\nUsed to talk to myself, I told him, \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nBuckle up, cause it's about to be rough\nHe said, \"Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed\"\nThen we squashed it, I let em know: \"Watch it --\nWe only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit\"\nGosh, it feels great just to increase the chance\nFor a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor\n\n[Verse 7: Megalon + MF Doom]\nI pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what?\nNow it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up\nOn the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up\nBaby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete\nDamn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already\nCan't stand you, understand you deadly\nBut my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy\nYo' Doom, you ready?\nYeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it?\nWhatever\n\n[Verse 8: MF Doom]\nCome on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day\nRemind me of the same style I flipped on \"Hey!\"\nYikes! Who can fuck with the likes\nOf one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's\nMetal grill, with many styles, better still\nFeel like number 26 on a roulette wheel\nAnd deal, and run rings around rhymers\nAnd run rings like number runners whose old-timers\n\n[Verse 9: Megalon]\nShorty in the all black, she think she all that\nI called her, she said, \"Don't call back!\"\nShe called me, now what you call that?\nLet's go back, I sold crack\nHold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that\nFuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at?\n\n[Verse 10: MF Doom]\nSuffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash\nHe love her, motherfuck her ass\nMetal feet dented your car fender\nMy agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender\nIs unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown?\nMF like Mike Fran Corleone\nAnd got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at?\nAn invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act\nRaised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback\nFront? I'mma be back! (Like brothers in the street act)\n(Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback)\n(Fuck with me I'll be back)\nLike niggas in the streets act (streets act!)\n\n[Outro: Sample]\nOf black misery\nThe finest"

Let mud fly\nWhen I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry\nSo I ask why the styes from the cess\nShit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest\nThe super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand\nThrowing MCs to the fire from out the frying pan\nIt ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying\nFronting like you death-defying, you need to stop lying\nSpeak your piece only once you're spoken to first\nNow let me hear your verse while I'm choking you\nWith well refined rhymes like a editor\nThrow them to my collections of skulls and spines like Predator\nFuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?) was Jet Jaguar and James Brown\n(yeah yeah, only them two)\nAin't you glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up (True, true)\nI'd like to say, \"Hi, it's Sci.Fly the odd Merlin\"\nThat's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling\nWho eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling\nWho see God toke but never see God hurlin'\nMy man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost\nMe myself I got flavors that out-taste most\nWith numb gums, some rhymers is lactose\nBack to you MF DOOM, you late show host\nS to the U to the P E R-uh\nWho chronicle these times in a 3D horror\nThriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama\nWho break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower\nLone gunman who candidly flip fly flows\nSingle-handedly with one eye closed\nIn a fly pose, no shirt Alay\u00e9\nMay see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay\nThat's that n a smash way how he did it\nMotherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute\nExquisite scripts, that quick shit, go with flow\nThat's how we do it though"

   "lyrics": "[Hook: Pebbles the Invisible Girl]\nFeel the magnetism between us (The mic)\nGrowing stronger and stronger (The mic)\nWhy don't we do it? (The mic)\n\n[MF Doom]\nI was in a case out of state\nShe was thirteen and good, we had a hotter date\nIt was just a number, she never told she was knocked up\nBy the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up\nMy aunt came and got me, and steadied the block\nWe bounced to the yeti, and I'm ready to rock\nWith no attachments, feelin a little loose\nBlowin up in every spot, we had a little juice\nProbably the Dom or the Afghani bud in me\nWe played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly...\nWho tapped me? I'm bout to get real ill\nAlready ripped the whole club with Metal Face's steel wheel\nWhat a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes\nAnd fine, she pulled me to the sidelines\nThe mystery shot up with strong words\nShe was an intelligent wisdom and a songbird\nI met her last week at the same place\nShe stepped to me, the same way at a no shame pace\nI'm off guard, her game had me choked up\nCheckin me, play testin me, till I spoked up\nSeven whole days and nights and not a word from you (not a word)\nI was worried, I thought I woulda heard from\nStranger, you know I never get enough of you\nHow you be comin through...\nMyself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three\nIn my earlier days they showed me things new to me\nSo we knew mad brothers who they had hit off\nThey even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off\nWhen slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her\nSwitchin off three times a night made them more opener\nSo you could love Allah, or leave him the hell alone\nMessage from my godfather, solid gold telephone\nMany of my men went up in smoke\nWhile trickin with these chickens, and ended up broke\nYou find out who's ya mans when you broke\nLike a bad joke, it's funny, when you on you got mad folk\nI played the middle man in every little scam\nSome as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam\nI find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers\nWalk upon me speaking with they stinkin mouth (About what?)\nAbout this and that from sneakers to hats to gats\nFreak chicks with the cooty cat raps\nAnd it's that cool the dice at that\nI'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat\nI play the back, steady on the humble\nBut be right up front when we get ready to rumble\nI gave her breath control, ask her who she learned off\nCoulda took her back to the crib, somehow was turned off\nMe and you... was overdue\nFrom gettin together baby\nI always knew our love was meant to be\n\nFeel the magnetism between us (The Mic)\nGrowing stronger and stronger (The Mic)\nWhy don't we do it"

Who know what is it?\nThese styles will be flipped to the absolute exquisite\nIt's like a blizzard, soon as I got home from ATL\nLooked into my baby's face, my boo was like ... \"Well!\nI know your types of clientele! Thoughts, needs\"\nAs I held her firmly, yet gentle as the soft sea\nShe said, \"The one with the horse weave? The pretty one?\nAll crazy, had to touch the tattoo through the short sleeve\nWhich one you want?\" I'm like, \"If there was comp?\nFuck around, a nigga like me probably run up in all three!\"\nKing Geedorah what they call me, either caesar or baldy\nProbably have moved since last y'all saw me\nOn the D-low, I slaughter solo emcees, they paper-thin\nIn they Polo, Nautica, or DK men\n\nAmen! It's funny how significance make a difference\nNotice parables of three in every other inference\nFor instance: \"Who wanna battle? On the real?\nChoose your weapon: microphone, beats, or the wheels-of-steel\"\nI own a crown in all three for getting down without a doubt\nI'd like to give a extra special out to Jet Jaguar, the sun, moon and star\nThe Monster Island Czars - y'all know who you are\nGet that!\n\n[Hook]\nM-O-N-E-Y\nNever did a thing for L-O-V-I-N\n\n[Megalon]\nComing straight from the black lungs\nI rip tracks for all players that pack guns\nStack ones in packs, done and doing back-to-back runs\nTo my peeps that close, so's ya' knows what's up\nY'all know the dough's quick, hoes that mess with 5-O shrimp like, \"What?\"\nLike they wanna shmoosh us, just to packing the pushers\nI'm packing gat then bust a cap at po-po\nIf they catch us and try to push us\nSince when a MINY nigga don't be taking no shit?\nI be that drug dealing nigga that be fucking ya' bitch!\n\n[King Ghidra]\nWhat a fella! Like Salt, Pepa, Spinderella\nI came to spark the deaf, dumb and blind like Helen Keller\nIf I'm not with George of the Jungle, if he not with Stella\nOr either Priscilla, I'm doing dips on Godzilla\nThough y'all know he don't play, right?\nTNT throws a nigga out a moving van in broad daylight\nAnd he was shackled by hands and feet\nThen they say he tried to escape, once his face scraped the concrete\nNear the curb on Monster Island, 103 Street\nWhere brothers run the risk of getting swallowed once the Beast eat\nI'd rather lay in the cut, collect cash pay\nOnly TNT I see is Gilligan's castaway\nWith Mary Jane and Ginger\nOh, from which you spent the night by accident, I creep like a ninja\nWhen the mack is bent, who can give one fuck?\nGet bucked, get broke up like three-piece nun-chucks\nY'all sun struck, sick to they head-piece\nThree-headed beast brings the drama to a dead cease\n\n(Get that money, god)\n\nSick to they head-piece\n(Get that money, god)\n\n(Get that money, god)\n\n(Get that money, god)\n\nGreenbacks ... the meanest green stacks\n\n[Hook]\nM-O-N-E-Y\nNever did a thing for L-O-V-I-N\nNever\nAsk me what I need, I need your\nM-O-N-E-Y"

Rolled through, brrat!\nOld to the new knows who holds the hat\nCustom tailored fitted, head stayed same size\nBig since first born, well spitted game wise\nSame guy, same disguise\nSick aim eye stare at thick dame thighs, click claim prize\nAnd the lucky contestant was sent\nA whole year's supply of buckets of yucky excrement\nDigital format, provide the ROM\nRide calm, flow was like a roadside bomb\nFlipped the Humvee, impact was limb-numbing\nCameraman wig back, gunner screaming \"Incoming!\"\nRPG, rhyme propelled grenade\nTime to yell, scramble for cover in the shade\nBright as the midday sun, then it fade\nDarkness come quick, some run and get sprayed\nRot dead, hot lead, it's rainin\nLeft 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin\nDragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps\nDog tag attached to explosive human booby traps\nWhere's air support? Ears ringin, mortars whistlin\nBloodshot vision, afterthought: abort mission\nToo little too late, as the last man gush\nTook no prisoners mush, rap ambush\n\n[Outro]\nMurdalizing sucker emcees!"

That was loud!\nGot to ya, huh?\n\nHere's an interesting note: artificial colors\nYellows or Reds\nLet's focus on the red\nIn addition to FD&C Red Number 40, the FDA has approved certain food coloring additives, some are actually POISON!\nIf you aren't sure of the additives or colorings in the products you've purchased, LEAVE IT ALONE!\nPOISON!\nBAD NEWS!\nTHAT'S RIGHT!\n\nThank you\nWell, I think that about covers all of the natural foods out here\nNow then, I have to go take my dessert here\nI have to go\nI'm conducting a cooking class today\nGood health to you all!\nUh, over this way\nLook out!\n\nAlright Pops, still feel like charging me for that meal?\n\nOne look at his feature-less face\nOne look was enough to ensure his safety\nAs years passed, he became even more bitter and angry\nBurning with vengeance against the world\nFinally, amidst hidden scrolls, he found what he'd been seeking\nThen, clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor, and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic, he returned to his homeland\nAnd there he has remained\nScheming, dreaming, planning\nPlotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world\n(I can't believe it!)\n(Alright, don't make a big deal about it)\nI warn you Doom, you've gone too far\n(Yeah!)\nThat'll do it Doom, get your machine"

Villain\nWhat rhymes with stealin? Villain\nHe's a villain, yes he is\nThat's right, I'll smack the black off of ya punk!\n\n[Verse 4: Slug]\nVillain, pushin' on the couch cushion\nSouthside Minneap', never lived out in Brooklyn\nKept the faith, forget the fame\nIf they sweat the name, let it set the lane\nHeld mind, cold and hard\nHad no regard who the chosen are\nWho, you? Oh no\nYou played the oboe, keep it on the low low\nRappers are candy, butterscotch\nI'ma let their baby mothers watch\nShe loves the ock, I touch the spot\nBitch, I'm the itch that must've got up her crotch, heh\nNow stop, fill the buildings\nLeave some pills for these little villains\nHey shorty, share the flask\nLet me explain why I wear this mask\n\n[Outro]\nVillain!\nI want you to call me at that address if I'm still there\nGonna make sure you get cracked!"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\"And that ended Doom's plans for world destruction!\"\n\"And how did you manage to stop him?\"\n\"Simple, I [..] rearranged the circuits\"\n\"Once he threw the switch\" {*bang*}\n\"My ability to attack is faster than the cobra...\" {*dialogue fades*}\n\"Very helpful.\"\n\"And I will be careful, not to make the same mistakes as Doom!\"\n\n[Verse: E. Mason]\nWhat's the hero, who's the villain?\nDead or livin, killed or killin, who the fuck should remain chillin?\n(Doom) Webster says, wicked and evil, but yo who's Webster?\nNihilation and outcast, equals freedom that's so fast\nCulture in chains, that be the rolls villain plays\nAll these are just metaphors, they describe symbols in folklore\nBut who knows why it's like this?\nHero? Hit or old miss? Maybe it's all good\nReally of God, but who should, determine the real\nEvil, what's the deal\nFools rush in, they don't know the yin, from the yang\nAnd are ashamed to deviate, or act sane\nFrom the norm, they are slaves, forced to conform\nTo really find your essence, take this as a lesson\nBreak away from the rest of them\nGet from the form ending, like the villain in the song\nFind truth, who determines wrong\nFrom right, without a fistfight\nDifferent from day than from night {Operation... Doomsday}\nIt's just a simple play on words\nDelete all these punks ass herbs\nWho's the hero, what's the villain?\nThe question still remains chillin\nListen to the music, try very hard to use it\nOpen up and research, and that's the end of this verse\nBut y'all niggas keep y'all minds open out there\n\n[Outro]\n\"So like fuck you, fuck the newspaper, fuck all that shit man!\"\n\"I'm leavin\" {\"Good evening\"}\n\"Yo why you want to be leaving man?\"\n\"Man don't worry about that sucker, yo man listen\"\n\"Yo I'm not gonna finish my piece man, not with this lady around man\"\n\"Yo what the fuck is this shit man?\"\n\"I don't like that shit man, I don't want no fuckin pictures taken of my shit man\"\n\"Yo relax!\"\n\"Nah man, that shit is fucked up man, that shit can get us busted over here man!\"\n\"Relax man it's for the paper\"\n\"NAH NAH I'm not gonna relax, I'm gettin the fuck out of here\"\n\"Look, we got a car! She's got a car parked right over there man!\"\n\"Let's get the fuck out of here!\"\n\"Well come on let's go then!\"\n\n\"Doom, wears body armor to conceal his own mangled form, right?\" \"Yeah\"\n\"So like fuck you\"\n\"Do yourself a favor.. do yourself.. trust me\""

It's a little deeper\nMe against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper\nSwing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off\nDemented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you\nI do not lie, when I doze off spirits hope I die, whatever\nAngels waste the time, they work together\nScheme and plot on me, cause I'm the son of man\nI hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam\nDon't give a damn if the bullets fill me\nI don't wanna live, I hope they kill me\nPut me out my misery, I live in misery\nI kill all my enemies, cause I love company\nThose who seek me, are called wise men\nOr either wise-guys I pray you comprehend\nAnd realize I'm condemned\n\nNo rest, homicidal dreams\nMy cellmate, all he do is scream\nOut loud how he wants to go home\nThat's funny, I'm here all alone\nLocked, in a single cell\nHis back's bleeding, he's cold as hell\nAnd I'm hoping, they turn on some heat\nI call the C.O. to bring some extra sheets\n\"Where'd he go?\" he walk through walls, run halls, I pray \"teach me\"\nThey don't see him at the health they try to reach me\nI said \"please see how he feels\"\nThey said, \"He's alright but he's not real\"\nEvaluations say I suffer from depression\nHallucinations, self-creations, what they're guessin'\nI'm here doing years, I'm stressin'\nMedicate me, sedate me want me to rest an'\nDon't take it cause he said that won't be best an'\nHe said I need his help and he needs me\n\"Nigga you walk through walls, go home you're free\"\n\nHome, that was far and he was turned off\nCause his wings was burned off\nA lesson was learned, communicate with one\nI was chosen cause I'm God's son\n\n[MF Doom]\nAnd I'm the retarded one!\n(*sings*) Out in the streets\nYou won't survive with, wack-ass beats (\"We can see that!\")\nThese days and times\nWatch as we get ours with rhymes\n\nTo my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast-iron\nWho been in to win and blast to the last siren\nOn the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick\nChased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosovik\nAnyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?\nOnce I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's\nIf I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky\nAt your local sleazy speak-easy\nFor any fan of the limelight\nIn the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite\nIt's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale\nWith rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail\nJumpin Jehosaphat, who's that?\nWho cats who do magic be like \"tell me how you do's that\"\nHeck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko\nThought I might do techno\nHa ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet\nFor no reason he get cussed out like Tourettes\nYet tight flow to make her bad-ass stutter\nOr even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter\nButter, word play since third grade age\nBack when we used to play \"Bang! Open bird cage\"\nHip hop's Benny Hill sip Henny straight, get every penny weighed, then he chill, at any rate\nMy metal-face hoes with tongue or (at) least eye ring\nDo yourself, I will continue to do my thing\nLike Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting\nAnd the super-villain strike again like lightning\nIn the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?\nAnd a name-drop like pick the name out the hat\nThat's a no jiver from the, liver conniver\nWho vote players out the rap game like Survivor while I\nDrop through greens like a nerd cat with intended speech from way back\nAnd spin on your back and then freeze\nWhile I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero\nSo called rhymers, go call Cleo\nWhile I, steal the show like thought-so-try-hiking\nSuper-duper stars need Ortho-TriCylin\nSometimes the men, mostly from the women\nI hear voices saying that's the super-villain\n(Uhh, I hear voices)\nMostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain"

Raw by the laws of attraction\nFor future generation's information - the black one\n... Move the crowd like a buddha cloud\nThe purple, puff puff pass 'round the circle\nA jerk well renowned for his work skill\nHe's out, the proof is the computer's down Urkel\nMC a show via wi-fi\nAnd paid way before we wrap it up like tie-dye\nHip-Hop sci-fi you can see\nHe had the eye of the tiger through the mask like the Fry Guy\nJust made a baby Olmec dome check\nLeft some folks' ancestors home wreck\nWith blown backs these lesser known facts thwart evil\nIt got no reason, like short people\nNo offense, his feet was burnt brass\nWhenever he walked on the street it turned glass\nOn his lucky rat's paw in the crap drawer\nAll the world's a stage, where's the trap door, slackjaw\nLogic, to keep your mind in the project\nDrop the check, his job is to chop necks\nThat's just payback for noses there's no psych though\nWhat they don't know like Bo\nWon't hurt Diddley squat\nGot to be kiddin me, not\nSeriously plot, to put a hit out on a G-spot\nGypped like Egypt out their kettles and they teapot"

Teach peace to the babies\nWe're all the same\nAt least for the ho's sake\nStepped on an undisclosed rake\nCatch a nose-ache...\nY'all flows is fake\nYodle-eh-hee-who wants to be my protege?\nMe\u2014me too!\nSo parrot-back it\nI'm an underlined caret bracket\nGreater than or equal to\nBut greater than four stars\nGreater than straight-A report cards\nGreater than poor sports in divorce courts or sports bars\nWhat's your mission?\nMaking hundreds\nShaking blunders in this self (inaudible) taking on fun-filled until\u2014\nDone\u2014chill\nIt ain't all about the dollar bill\nYou could be dead broke and be a scholar still\nThat's true\nWhat question should I ask you?\nUh\u2014\"What type of ill-type of tricks do the mask do?\"\nOkay; what type of ill-type of ill tricks do the mask do?\nThe face plate remove and I give chicks tattoos\nBut then they can see your face!\nI make 'em look the other way\nI almost caught a case off that same shit the other day\nIn Grady's truck is where I first got lucky\nIn the 80s, now I make the ladies say, \"Yucky!\" like Sandy\nBollocks, that old mustache is bull-snot\nOn your bald spot\nNow that's what I call hot!"

This is Bumpy Knuckles\nJust calling to say that I'm proud of the work you been doing dog\nYou know this whole album and all that that you've been working on my dude\nIt's like, it's like a long time coming man for people to get a chance to\nLook into the mind of a villain, you know like somebody who really has\nA serious outlook on their craft, you know there's a lot of clowns out here\nWith you know, painted faces and when they take the paint off\nIt's just a clown with no paint on their face [DOOM laughing]\nSo please understand my dude I'm watching you man and I see what you doing\nIt's the OG man Bumpy Knuckles straight fly, aight?\nMy motto for 2009 is fuck everybody [DOOM laughing], aight?\nSo when you go on stage and you put your middle finger up to the crowd\nAsk them to put it back up\nAnd when they show respect to the villain they should say fuck everybody [DOOM laughing]\nCause that's what everybody's gonna say when they have to show respect for you\nAhh fuck him, fuck him that's the dinkest shit in the world if they write this\nWell fuck you\nCause everybody wanna be what you are\nYou nah'mean?

You hear that? Naw\nDOOM stay way up in the cut like Ma and Pa\nWhen he come out he dumb out, there he go\nThe villain with the illest flow in all of Mexico\nAll foes on some when he leave out let me know\nJust so's I can breath out before I let go\nRappers is like Satchmo that you best know\nInvest in free dough like Matthew Lesko\nFollowed by hailstorms, snow and earthquakes\nGive out more toothaches than first birthday cakes\nThe more we reverse scripts the worse they fate\nTo beat y'all with dimes and dummy Anbesol shake\nNow you got a rhyme tummy ache by mistake\nCan't call it, can't call Jake, call cannonball face\nDig tapes and stay in great shape\nToday's rap game is like one big date rape\nThe name ring bell like ring ding dong\nHe can never be wrong like Ling Ting Tong\nOnce heard a hit song, sounded like an annoying gong\nIt's so wack, I ain't wanna hit the bong\nNow who get iller with the pen than I do?\nAnd in it just to get the benjamin like Netanyahu?\nLet the god bless you like Achoo!\nGet you like whats that on your chest, got you\nPNS beat good for you it's shredded wheat\nAs well as getting shredded by the metal headed lead feet\nSon 'em and dead 'em like a dad that's dead beat\nBeat him like a dead horse, nasty as red meat\nDOOM memorize rhymes and still forgot\nCall it how he see it and kill a shot, like Willard Scott\nIn the place to be like no iller spot\nTo spill a knot, it's like a chilling thriller plot\nStarring the villain as the black Jesus\nIf it ain't the 'gnac or the Jack it's Grey Goose\nStill could stay loose off grape juice regardless\nNevertheless did his best on the retarded test\nIt's trick questions, always kept a cheat sheet\nOn the microphone, a rep up before Beat Street\nAnd beat meat that MF DOOM he stay true\nIf you online check the site and FAQ\n\n[Hook]"

And now...you is 'bout to dance, like you ain't never danced before\n\n[Verse 1: MF DOOM]\nThis one'll have you get the trash hash out the stash, as they say, \"Ash to Ash\"\nJewels free rash, fools ask the mask\nNeed me? I'll be peeing in the pool, ka-splash!\nYou may feel a slight drizzle\nVillain\u2014give a squealer a candlelight vigil\nCouldn't find a healer with a whistle in the line of sight\nAnd he hold the mic like a fistful of dynamite\nThey wonder how he built his C-note tower\nAll before zero hour it's tree grow power\nThen he go shower to scour off the funk\nAnd watch a so-called comp cower soft punk\nThe god is the oddest fella you'll find\nPaid to speak his mind like Father Jealous Divine\nHe came to rock the banquet, rank it\nAlong with two of the baddest broads to act stank wit, blank spit\nDilla raise the beat like a anchor banker\nOverstand the shoot and plays the heat\nAnd shank a wanker\nHe drank a tank of angst, thank ya\nGuess what? Chicken head butts\nHit a rhyme on time, like kicked 'em dead in the nuts\nOh... the victim had guts\nPrepare to stick 'em, I'll slick 'em in the cut\nGo... sell a spear chucker voodoo\nGot'ed her off wholesale mare schmuck new spew\nSo... sell a beer trucker doodoo\nFoes go to hell in a seersucker muumuu\n\n[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]\nDOOM!\nGuilty!\nDilla, Dilla!\nGrind for the paper, hot like Sanka\nTop notch ranker, clock my banker\nDead Presidents, sick dudes - I'm the medicine\nStorming in your residence when I'm in my element\nNo contest, I get hot and go unconscious - ya boy is automatic\nNow go play in traffic, the flow is graphic\nWith no theatrics, still rock sold out shows for practice\nCall it a walk-through. Def. The wrong one to talk to\nBeef ain't nothin I can't stick a fork through\nWe break bread, eat good, and pour brew\nCheers!\nCome toast to the one with respect to the utmost on more than one coast\nGS, check the style I splash, to make the listener wanna pile my cash\nKing of the Hill, money is the issue\nIt's all on me tell 'em bring me the bill\nDaddy Warbucks, shift gears in the armored truck\nLike Big Daddy Kane when I warm it up\nFans scream for the two man team\nDoom and Guilty - Hip Hop supreme\nThe denim is blue but the pockets green\nBig knots in jeans, you can't stop the kings"

Ooh, my\nDraw conclusions, more to mislead in\nSuicidal extension cords and wrists bleedin'\nHis dark folks is lonely, cold, 'tis the season\nLesson, leave bags to self for this reason\nKeep faith, electricity; these nouns\nIs why at times we end texts with three crowns\nAnd why we load up with jewels like these rounds\nKeep a couple of jokes for fools and these clowns\nYou can catch him at the Barnum\nAnd Bailey, they be wicked on the daily, tryna pardon\nOr we could throw boulders at a glass house\nWatch her in the kitchen cookin' nekkid with her ass out\n'Til she pass out"

This place is filled with pretender willies\nOne false move and get broke off like end of Phillies\nYes true believers\nAin't nothing new to a\nCrook with special powers like how to tell the future uhhhhh...\nI picture rhyme of the month, two page long\nI'm in it with two gauges and my cape on wrong\nSon it's on, it's like a Raekwon tape song\nWith a fleet of superbad bitches, status: Rae Dawn Chong\nLet me know if y'all with me y'all (HEY!!!)\nIt's national and geographic, down to the titty ball\nI represents MI City y'all\nTo my man Wiz doing his unsettling bids\nYou woulda got away if it was not for them meddling kids\n\nM'er F'ers"

I see)\nIt ain't nuttin' like, Hip Hop music\n\n[Verse: MF Doom]\nIt Ain't nuttin' like a fist full of cash or a bliss full of the hash\nThat twist like a mustache, from end to end, spread it like a rash\nFrom talking through your Walkman or at your disco bash\nGive me the Timbs Rumpelstiltskin brown\nA metal face mask with a built in frown\nA mic to tilt down, a hundred thousand pounds\nAnd see how kilt sound like spilt milk clown\nCocoa butter on very ashy day fam\nWith Ray-Bans out on the islands of Cayman\nOr I'll break it down for the layman\nBain De Soleil for that Saint Trope... tannnn\nA can a ole gold too cold to hold, slow ya roll\nKeep on moving like Soul II Soul, hold the dough\nLike a fool who stole pity y'all\nFrom tryna' go up against city hall titty bar\nThe black mic is like a red violin\nOk, everybody back to the lab, try again\nBloody rap game like Leviathan\nLeave a bad taste, killin' my high like Niacin\nStop kiddin' middlemen need Ritalin\nHit me with the full tin of gin and I'm a kid again\nKeep the bong lightin' straight through the song writin'\nThe Supervillain AKA the thong bitin', that's inviting all\nTo the reciting that's dope and raw\nHoping all y'all come in peace and its open bar\nTear the roof off this Bumba Ras Clot\nBy the end of the night spazz like Shazbot\nSpilt a shot made the pen lines runny\nA ill plot that's ten times Ben Stein\u2019s money, funny\nHow he rips the scripts with a straight face\nWith more rhymes than is lines in ya database\nPlacing rappers in endangerment, who's reckless\nWith this food for thought sorta' like breakfast\nYou could mark it off as wreck on the checklist\nWear gold fronts, can't afford no necklace\nShit, that there, could go to help buildin' daycares\nSomebody say yeahh.. (yeahhh!)\nPay ya fares,... give the Herbalizers their shares\nAnd y'all could pay DOOM in beers... Cheers!..."

Abe Lincoln\nAnd still spend stacks off crack, stay crinklin'\nThis game's built to get got while blinkin'\nRappers do big up jail like a recruiter\nLet 'em tend ta hit a boy, said he was a shooter\nTold him \"Man up, or keep it pushin' like a scooter\"\nThen said nuttin' and didn't pass the Buddha\nLo and behold, police shows up\nSpit his shitty sixteen and got his self froze up, up\nHis story had a moral, it's buried in the soil\nVil put it in her back like the epidural\nKids: eat, sleep, stay away from creeps\nSpit it from the heart, this game's for keeps\nSo peep\nYeah, saga of a true B-Boy\nBeware any likenesses or imagery is a decoy\nSho nuff, yo fluff, force like Bruce Leroy\nBring trouble up and get double cut\u2014 keloid\nBubble up, run 'em up, destroy\nAnd anything else you see\u2014 void\nRightful ownership\nGot a bone to pick with the phoniest colonialist\nWho own a ship\nThe loneliest known to rip\nKnown to sip pine and ripple\nFind yourself in a bind and pickle\nDon't bite the hand that feeds you, bite the nipple\nIn this land of black and brown, ain't no backin' down\nAs foul as that sound, it's hard to find a cap and gown\nBut it's always like a MAC around\nB-r-r-r-r-at!! Man down\nMetal is empowered, devil is a coward\nIt all smells of high hell like no one ever showered\nScrub behind ya ears, shed the final tears\nRemember what the world was like in the final years\nJust a speck of dirt in the universe, snap fingers\nJust like that\u2014 assume the worst\nBack in business, guzzle beers, track and fitness\nLaps get faster, could've missed Christmas\nWhat is this?"

   "lyrics": "[Verse]\nIt's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes\nBlare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes\nReal rhymes not your everyday hologram\nEven when ribs was touchin', never swallowed the ham\nHe'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad\nIt might need salt like your man's bland ballad\nA lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's\nBlues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose\nRake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly\nBreak it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy\nButter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy\nAlways threw me off when she told me, \"Daddy, funk me\"\nI'm like, \"Anywho's\"\nSeeds walkin' all out in street with out any shoes\nI guess it's better than some funky socks\nYou need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox\nInstead she wanna hear the beatbox\nTake pills and make fake krills as sheetrock\nSing it, bring it, back to your laboratory\nWhile he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story\nThe mask is like Jason\nThey told the place not to let the basket type case in\nHe could be some kind of wacko\nWaitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho\nHe busted in, blessed be the Lord\nWho believe any mess they read up on a message board\nIf so, I got bridges for the low low\nSame bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo\nHere, orange peel stogs for the whole tier\nFeel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear\nIt was the shit when I first scooped it\nAt least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid\nPlead the fifth, sip wine stiffly\nPatiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy\nGift for the grind, criminal mind shifty\nSwift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty\nWell edumacated, he heard it when he meditated\nIn deep theta, let her hate the creep later\nDedicated cheap skata who keeps data\nSay he stay self medicated to sleep later\nSide effects is similar to sugar pill\nWhoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ill\nAnd made his exit on some calm shit\nBegged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit\n(\"Doom!\")"

That's it\n\n[Verse 2 : Cuban Link]\nPunisher bash it, at last it's, rappers that really blast shit\nCats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate\nUp in Jimmy's Cafe, havin caviar\nCrackin Cristal at the bar, smokin cigars, livin large\nWe rob and steal, run with the mob, doin jobs for bills\nI'm hard to kill for real nigga guard your grill\nI like to chill, spark an L and get high\nI'm one hell of a guy, fly pelican fly\n\n[Verse 3 : JuJu]\nWhattup Duke-o, you know, politickin papi chuco\nI'm out here, watching for Jake, getting this loot though\nShoot bro, I got a waterproof suit yo\nSwervin like a A.K.A. in Beirut yo\nSqueezin, out of automatic M3's and\nPlease, you ain't seen no thugs like these\nI can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe\nIn Corona yo it's better to take than to receive\n\n[Verse 4 : Psycho Les]\nYour career's on life support, and I'mma pull the plug\nAnd have every thug shootin that Beatnut drug\nIn they blood, no escapin this\nNiggas is goin over their favorite shit (for what?) to be tapin this\nWorld premier, loud and clear\nLa and beer, get the dough, blow up the show\nDissapear, jump in the Cavalier\nFeelin marvelous, street pharmacist, twist arboles\nFor pleasure, bring your territory terror\nKeep my workers under pressure got em sayin \"FUCK LESTER\"\nBut that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold\nDon't give a fuck where you been what you done\nWhere you go, you know, peep this statement\nIn black shades like a secret, agent\nWe're night thieves, roll up on you like sleeves\nWe light trees, bust these and stack cheese\n\n[Chorus 2x]\nIt's off the hook this year\nMakin mad money off the books this year, ain't nothin\nBut crooks in here\nGettin mad money off the books this year\n\n[Verse 5 : Guru]\nBrothers are amused by others brother's reps\nBut the thing they know best is where the gun is kept\nCause in the night you'll feel fright\nAnd at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might\nWanna do a dance or two\nCause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew\nNo matter if you or your brother's a star\nHe could pop you and jet without a getaway car\nAnd some might say that he's a dummy\nBut he's sticking you and taking all of your money\nIt's a daily operation\nHe might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station\nMad brothers know his name\nSo he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game\nAnd while we're blaming society\nHe's at a party with his man\nThey got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing\nIt looks big but they ain't staring\nJust thinking of a way and when to get the brother\nThey'll be long gone before the kid recovers\nAnd back around the way he'll have the chain on his neck\nClaiming respect, just to get a rep"

Let mud fly\nWhen I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry\nSo I ask why the style's from the cess\nShit be fuckin with my eye as I pull it to the chest\nThe super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand\nThrowin emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan\nIt ain't no use in tryin, man\nSon, stop cryin\nFrontin' like you death-defyin'\nYou need to stop lyin'\nSpeak your piece only once you're spoken to first\nNow lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you\nWith bubbly fine rhymes like a editor\nThrow them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator\nFuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (who?)\nWas Jet Jaguar and James Brown\n(Yeah, yeah only them two niggas?)\nAnd I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up\n(True, true)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'd like to say hi\nIt's {?} fly the odd Merlin\nThat's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling\n{?} bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling\nWho see God ?, never see God earlin'\nMy man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost\nMe myself I got flavors that out-taste most\nWith numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast\nBack to you MF Doom, you late show host\nS to the U to the P E R-uh\nWho chronicle these times in a 3-D horror\n{?} co-star or in a realer drama\nWho break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower\nLone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes\nSingle-handedly with one eye closed\nIn a fly pose, no shirt {?}\nMay see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay\nThat's in a smash way how he did it\nMuthafucka probably couldn't peep it past a minute"

Sparklin' jewels\nIn effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules\nFools, the roach was never dead\nLive for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head\nInstead it was depicted as flicked in\nSplit, the wicks lit"

It's all just hearsay\nLeave a wig like it was having a bad hair day\nMiracle glide master, asked him what's his secret\nHe said Shasta and turned to formaldehyde faster\nWhen I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily\nOne night, she tried to flail me with her ukulele\nPack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat\nWith a bunch of crackers and some snack meat\n\n[Chorus]\nThey better have my scrilla\nCut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya?\nAll this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E\nDrink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly\nRemind me to remember what you told me\nHoly moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly?\nYo, G, remind me to remember what you told me"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nA modern day marvel, but terrible\u2014better\u2014horrible\nWhen he grab the mic from son, he crushed up\u2005all\u2005his metacarpals\nHe said\u2005he ain't mean it\u2014totally by accident\nAfter\u2005the show, he didn't follow where y'all taxi went\nWill this be available on wax? Ask Max Mill\nThey on the opposition to his ass-wack tax bill\nBut will it pass the senate? Slum lord tenant\nAnd super like 1-A, have a fun stay\nOne day, he plan to put in a runway\nWith enough land for his own projects and gun play\nSection 8 penthouse, maid look like Faye Dunaway\nAlotta y'all ass out like gay runaways\nIt's how they say \"semi-risque\"\nAll day everyday, give out Emmy's the quick way\nHave the average MC say, \"Gimme a sick day!\"\nThey really ain't got shit to say like Timmy McVeigh\nGet a hunch, a real rag tag bunch\nIn school, he kept a doo-rag in his bag lunch\nJust to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit\nHe writ this skit in Sanskrit\nIf the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low\nYour man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it though\nIt's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow\nTucked-in Le Tigre\u2014just let the name-buckle show\n\n[Part III]\n\n[Verse 2]\nGood googly moogly\u2014see that loogie?\nYeah\u2014but keep it on the D.L. Hughley\nYou don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie\nJust to cut her loosie like, *swoosh*\u2014Mitsurugi\nGooey gum drops\u2014who he got his style from?\n\u2014his pops\u2014you gotta give the bum some props\nAsk ya sister\u2014her beat box is more-thicker\nDOOM that nigga detox with more liquor\n\n[Part IV]\n\n[Verse 3]\nVillain for hire\u2014admire the sound\nMake sure the price is right before he come on down!\nRappers be on some \"You, you, you!\"\nForgot who they talking too, too much pork stew\nThey need to not come out with nothing new\nBlew the whole shit up on some \"What this button do?\"\nDoom cheat the game like walk-thru\nRun 'em, son 'em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo\nThe way alotta clowns get down is unnatural\nThis flow flip like oranges, apples\nRhymes like limes to a Lemonade Snapple\nLeave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple\nFirst thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone\nThen they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on\nIn came the Villain with their own gear like, \"Hi, there\nY'all play the rear, this whole year\u2014my year.\"\nMetal face beard like Brillo pad\nY'all know his steelo so don't feel so bad\nSeed call him, \"Ol' dad,\" the one the ol' ho had\nKnew he was a winner since a swimmer in the gonads\nOkay pal, pay him like Paypal\nSo we could be A-OK not OK Corral\nI think today I'll make the ladies say, \"Ow\"\nAnd maybe fuck around take a bow, now\n\n[Part V]\n\n[Verse 4]\nWho made his first mill and still carry razor blades\nUsed to be straight A's and still made the grade\n'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?\nYear after last, left back in the retarded class\nShoulda went to Boces\nWatch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be\nVillain who always win, at least he stay consistent\nFind out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent\nYo\u2014yo, Max\u2014yo, change the beat, yo\nYou got another one?\n\n[Part VI]\n\n[Outro]\nNah, yo"

Running blindly not\nFeeling the floor, nothing to stand on we fall. Lost in\nThe halls, I'm looking for the doors. Confusion! My\nSenses are dying. My soul is crying. Let me out, let me\nOut! I'm screaming! Running blindly through the visions\nBarefoot and defenseless. Running blindly through the\nDark, infested woods. Time and time again. Disillusion\nI'm deeper in the maze. Further from the light. I scream\nOut of the confusion. I'm being consumed by confusion. My\n\nWorld has been shattered. Crippled. All we have left is\nFragments of doors. Though we once had but never had\nWe've all been fooled. Confusion. My senses are dying my\nSoul is crying. Let me out. Let me out. I'm screaming\nI'm living in a demented labyrinth. tortured. Lost\nCrippled. I'm a part of this confusion. Shattered\nConfusion. Shattered vision. All that I have left is\nIllusion. I'm screaming at the confusion. I'm being\nConsumed by confusion. In an abstract, in a world of\nConfusion!"

Now relax.\nRelax\nWhat do you want?\n(speaking Klingon)\nI don't speak Klingon\n(speaking Klingon)\nNo. Where is the bathroom?\nDo you know anyone here?\nNo, I don't know anyone here.\nAre you transporting Tribbles?\nNo, I'm not transporting Tribbles.\nI'm a Terreth! Are you a Klingon?\nYes. What do you want?\n(villian!)\n(speaking Klingon)\n(Well, thanks!)\nExcuse me\n(spitting noise)\nWhat is your number, Terreth?\nMy eyes sting. Now I can smell something. Help! Get help quickly!\n(crying)\nTo Terrens, this might seem a tackless way to begin a conversation, but among Klingons, it's considered quite civil.\nStop relaxing!\n(speaking Klingon)"

Ask Max Mill\nThey on the opposition to his ass-wack tax bill\nBut will it pass the senate? Slum lord tenant\nAnd super like 1-A, have a fun stay\nOne day, he plan to put in a runway\nWith enough land for his own projects and gun play\nSection 8 penthouse, maid look like Faye Dunaway\nAlotta y'all ass out like gay runaways\nIt\u2019s how they say \"semi-risque\"\nAll day everyday, give out Emmy's the quick way\nHave the average MC say, \"Gimme a sick day!\"\nThey really ain't got shit to say like Timmy McVeigh\nGet a hunch, a real rag tag bunch\nIn school, he kept a doo-rag in his bag lunch\nJust to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit\nHe writ this skit in Sanskrit\nIf the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low\nYour man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it though\nIt's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow\nTucked-in Le Tigre\u2014just let the name-buckle show\n\n[Verse 2]\nGood googly moogly\u2014see that loogie?\nYeah\u2014but keep it on the D.L. Hughley\nYou don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie\nJust to cut her loosie like, *swoosh*\u2014Mitsurugi\nGooey gum drops\u2014who he got his style from?\n\u2014his pops\u2014you gotta give the bum some props\nAsk ya sister\u2014her beat box is more-thicker\nDOOM that nigga detox with more liquor\n\n[Verse 3]\nVillain for hire\u2014admire the sound\nMake sure the price is right before he come on down!\nRappers be on some \"You, you, you!\"\nForgot who they talking too, too much pork stew\nThey need to not come out with nothing new\nBlew the whole shit up on some \"What this button do?\"\nDoom cheat the game like walk-thru\nRun \u2019em, son \u2019em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo\nThe way alotta clowns get down is unnatural\nThis flow flip like oranges, apples\nRhymes like limes to a Lemonade Snapple\nLeave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple\nFirst thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone\nThen they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on\nIn came the Villain with their own gear like, \"Hi, there\nY\u2019all play the rear, this whole year\u2014my year.\"\nMetal face beard like Brillo pad\nY'all know his steelo so don't feel so bad\nSeed call him, \"Ol' dad,\" the one the ol\u2019 ho had\nKnew he was a winner since a swimmer in the gonads\nOkay pal, pay him like Paypal\nSo we could be A-OK not OK Corral\nI think today I'll make the ladies say, \"Ow\"\nAnd maybe fuck around take a bow, now\n\n[Verse 4]\nWho made his first mill and still carry razor blades\nUsed to be straight A's and still made the grade\n'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?\nYear after last, left back in the retarded class\nShoulda went to Boces\nWatch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be\nVillain who always win, at least he stay consistent\nFind out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent\nYo\u2014yo, Max\u2014yo, change the beat, yo\nYou got another one?\n\n[Outro]\nNah, yo"
