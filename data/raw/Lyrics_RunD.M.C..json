   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThis speech is my recital, I think it's very vital\nTo rock (a rhyme), that's right (on time)\n\"It's Tricky\" is the title, here we go...\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... it's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... Tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tricky) Trrrrrrrrrrricky\n\n[Verse 1]\nI met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly\nWent to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early\nThese girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me\nOr spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said \"It's not that easy\"\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... (How is it D?) It's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Trrrrrricky)\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... Tricky (Tricky) Tricky\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme\nThey really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time\nAnd in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide\nTinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... (How is it D?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) huh!\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I wake up people take up mostly all of my time\nI'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cause I make up a rhyme\nI'm not braggin', people naggin' cause they think I'm a star\nAlways tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far\nA girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play\nThen D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay\nI ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cause I'm on TV\nThey even bother my poor father cause he's down with me\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... (How is it?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky... Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tr-Tr-Tr-Tricky) Tr-tr-tr...\n\n[Outro]\nWe are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)\nThey offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone\nIt's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit\nYou keep on (rock!) shock 'cause this is it..."

Nimble was nimble and he was quick\nBut Jam Master cut faster, Jack\u2019s on Jay\u2019s dick\nNow Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep\nAnd Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep\nAnd Alice chilling somewhere in Wonderland\nJack\u2019s serving Jill a bucket in his hand\nAnd Jam Master Jay\u2019s making all that sound\nThe turntables might wobble, but they don\u2019t fall down\n\n[Verse 2: Run, D.M.C. & both]\nNow Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing\nBut Jam Master\u2019s getting loose and D.M.C.\u2019s the king\nCause he\u2019s adult entertainer, child educator\nJam Master Jay king of the crossfader\nHe\u2019s the better of the best, best believe he\u2019s the baddest\nPerfect timing when I\u2019m climbing I\u2019m a rhyming apparatus\nLot of guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts\nHis name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts\nAnd on the mix real quick and I\u2019d like to say\nHe\u2019s not Flash, but he\u2019s fast and his name is Jay\n\n[Break]\nIt\u2026 it goes a one, two, three, and\u2026\n\n[Verse 3: D.M.C.]\nJay\u2019s like King Midas as I was told\nEverything that he touched turned to gold\nHe\u2019s the greatest of the greater, get it straight, he\u2019s great\nPlaying fame cause his name is known in every state\nHis name is Jay, to see him play, will make you say\n\u201cGod damn that DJ made my day\u201d\nLike the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker\nHe\u2019s a maker, a breaker, and a title taker\nLike the little old lady who lived in a shoe\nIf cuts were kids he would be due\nNot lying, y\u2019all, he\u2019s the best I know\nAnd if I lie my nose will grow\nLike a little wooden boy named Pinocchio\nAnd you all know how the story go\n\n[Hook: Run]\nTricks are for kids, he plays much gigs\nHe\u2019s a big bad wolf and you\u2019re the three pigs\nHe\u2019s a big bad wolf in your neighborhood\nNot bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good\n\n[Break: Run & D.M.C.]\nThere it is\n\n[Verse 4: Run & D.M.C.]\nWe\u2019re Run-D.M.C., got a beef to settle\nD\u2019s not Hansel, he\u2019s not Gretel\nJay\u2019s a winner, not a beginner\nHis pockets get fat, others get thinner\nJ-j-j-j-j\u2026 jump on Jay like cows jump moons\nPeople chase Jay like dish and spoon\nAnd like all fairy tales end\nYou\u2019ll see Jay again my friend, huh!"

I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule\nIt's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool\nIt's all brand new, never ever old school\n\nYou got the music in your body and you can't comprehend\nWhen your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend\nMusic ain't nothin but a people's jam\nIt's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band\n\nNow I walked on ice and never fell\nI spent my time in a plush hotel\nI stood on many stages, held many mics\nTake airplane flights, at huge heights\nSo all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please\nCause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down ree's\nGot a song so strong, it's knocking down trees\nIs it hard to believe it's Run-DMC\n\nI am from, around the way\nAnd Run goes to school, every day\nAnd Jay plays the records he has to play\nAnd we get down with no delay, HEY!\nI rock the party with the words I speak\nAnd Run says the rhymes that are unique\nAnd Jay cuts the records every day of the week\nAnd we are the crew that can never be beat\nSo don't try to diss me, try to be my friend\nCause if you do, you'll get yours in the end\nThe rhymes we say, shall set a trend\nBecause a devestating rap is what we send\n\nEvery jam we play, we break two needles\nThere's three of us but we're not the Beatles\nMy name is Darryl, you can call him D\nYou can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC\nPeople always ask, \"DMC, what does it mean?\"\nD's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean\n\nLike we said before, we rock hardcore\nI'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw\nAnd now we got the knack, to attract\nOur rhyme's an aphrodisiac\nWe'll reign on your brain and rock your knot\nWhen it comes to rock, give it all we got\nTo be MC's, we got what it takes\nLet the poppers pop and the breakers break\nWe're cool cool cats, it's like that\nThat's the way it is, so stay the hell back\nWe're causin hard times, for sucker MC's\nCause they don't make no songs like these\nPERIOD!"

   "lyrics": "Kick off shoes, jump on the jock\nListen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock\nHis name is Jay and he's on his way\nTo be the best DJ in the US of A\n\nJ-a-y are the letters of his name\nCutting and scratching are the aspects of his game\nSo check out the Master as he cuts these jams\nAnd look at us with the mics in our hands\nThen take a count, 1 2 3\nJam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C\n\nHe's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster\nHe gets better cause he knows he has to\nIn '84 he'll be a little faster\nAnd only practice makes a real Jam Master\n\nWe're live as can be but we're not singing the blues\nWe got to tell all y'all the good news\nThe good news is that there is a crew\nNot 5, not 4, not 3, just 2\n2 MC's who are claiming the fame\nAnd all other things won't be the same\nBeacause it's about time for a brand new group\nRun-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop\nWe make the fly girls scream in ecstacy\nWe rock the freshest rhymes at a party\nWe put all the fellas in a daze\nIt's everyone that we amaze\nAnd we got the master of a disco scratch\nThere's not a break that he can't catch\nJam Master Jay that is his name\nAnd all wild DJ's he will tame\nBehind the turntables is where he stands\nThen there is the movement of his hands\nSo when asked who's the best, y'all should say:\n\"Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay\"\n\nJam Master Jay is the one in charge\nIt's up to him to rock beats that are truly large\nHe is the master of the scratch and cut\nSo move your arms, so move your legs\nSo won't you move your butt\n\nWe're not talking ground, we're not talking sky\nWe're not talking low, we're not talking high\nWe're not talking big, we're not talking small\nWe want all of the people on off the wall\nWe're not talking night, we're not talking day\nBut we're talking bout Jam Master Jay"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: A-Trak]\nYeah, Yeah, Yeah\n\n[Verse 1: D.M.C.]\nI ink a deal with Adidas, my pinkie stinky with stones\nNow that was back in the day, now little Dicky is grown\nAnd I was hot in the 80's, feel I'm hotter than you\nHad a Rolls and a Rollie and Run with [?] in the room\nRock Adidas, Adidas, the sneaker leaders for years\nYou can say what you wanna but my Adidas is here\nD, the king of the rappers and even king of the hood\nHad a list of his wishes, he wish a whack rapper would\nMan I was wheelin' and grinnin, they wasn't takin' it well\nJay was rockin' the wheels and we was rocking the shells\nNew York to Philly got illie, rockin' harder than Harden\nDid the stretch and then left 'em' and went and ripped up The Garden\nEntire, flyer no higher like 40 Benz and a Jag\nAsk any rapper alive, the Rev invented the swag\n\n[Verse 2: Run]\nAll day on display, amazing style\nEverything I say'll make the crowd go wild\nJam Master Jay, give me chance by the pile\nPut me in my Adidas since I was a child\nI'm in my pro models that I model like the pros\nI go full throttle I'm a lot like Derek Rose\nI'm Adidas down from my head to my toes\nEven when I'm in the gym it's the three-stripe shorts\nWhite superstars with the three black stripes\nI'm like a god when I'm rocking this mic\nThe greatest MC in all the years\nThe best sneakers in the world is the brand called Adidas\nIn case you, in case you, in case you forgot\nMe and my Adidas always standing on top\nWe rule hip-hop and all of the sports\nThe man on the beat is A-Trak of course\n\n[Hook: Staisha]\n(?)\n\n[Verse 3: Noize MC]\n\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u044b \u0441 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nShut up!!!\nYou talk too much\nYou talk too much\nYou talk too much\nYou talk too much\n\n[Verse 1]\nHey!  You over there, I know about your kind\nYou're like the Independent Network News on Channel 9\nEverywhere that you go, no matter where you at\nI said you talk about this, and you talk about that\nWhen the cat took your tongue, I say you took it right back\nYour mouth is so big, one bite would kill a Big Mac\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nYou never shut up\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never shut up\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou talk about people, you don't even know\nAnd you talk about places, you NEVER go\nYou talk about your girl, from head to toe\nI said your mouth's moving fast, and your brain's moving slow\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nYou never shut up!!\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never shut up\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou're the instigator, the orator of the town\nYou're the worst when you converse, just a big mouth clown\nYou talk when you're awake, I heard you talk when you sleep\nHas anyone ever told you, that talk is cheap\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nYou never shut, up!!\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\n[Verse 4]\nTalking is the one thing, that you can do best\nYou told the cavity creeps, to watch out for Crest\nYou never have the story, right and exact\nAnd then you always try to bore me, with your yakkity yak\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nAnd then you never shut up\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\n[Verse 5]\nEveryday you are out fighting someone in the street\nAnd you're always fighting someone you know ya can't beat\nThen you wonder how, you got in this mess\nJust think of what you said, then take a guess\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nYou never shut up!\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\n[Verse 6]\nYou're always spreading rumors, whether bad or good\nYou're the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood\nThe Barbara Walters, and the Howard Cosell\nYou always come around, with a story to tell\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nAnd then you never shut up\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\n[Verse 7]\nSaid it's everybody's business that you love to mind\nAnd talkin' to you, is like dropping a dime\nYou're spreading the word, like it is your job\nYou should be a stool pigeon, who works for the mob\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nAnd you never shut up\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never shut up!\n\n[Verse 8]\nA big blabbermouth, that's what you are\nIf you were a talk show host, you'd be a star\nI said your mouth is big, size extra large\nAnd when you open it, it's like my garage\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nAnd then you never shut up\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never shut up\n\n[Verse 9]\nYou always like to gossip, just like a girl\nYou talk so damn much, it's outta this world\nWhen you're reincarnated, in your second life\nYou won't be a man, you'll be a nagging wife\n\n[Hook]\nYou talk too much\nThen you never shut up\nHe said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nSHUT UP!!!\nSHUT UP!!!\n\n[Verse 10]\nTwenty-five hours, eight days a week\nThirteen months outta year, is when you speak\nI'm tired of listening to the garbage you talk\nWhy don't you find a short pier, and take a long walk\n\n[Outro]\nYou talk too much\nThen you never shut up!\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\nYou talk too much\nYou could be, out of breath\nYou talk too much\nMan you naggin' me to death\nYou talk too much\nTired of hearing you speak\nYou talk too much\nEight days a week\nYou talk too much\nThen you never shut up\nI said you talk too much\nWhy don't you ever SHUT UP!!!\nYou talk too much\nThen you never shut up!\nI said you talk too much\nHomeboy you never SHUT UP!!!"

DUMB GIRL!\n\n[D.M.C.]\nI wish I knew, why a girl like you\nWants to do all the things that you do\nI know you want a man, but you should understand\nThat J.C. ain't D, you shouldn't be his fan\nYou're not this fine, you're out of your mind\nAnd I wrote this rhyme just for your kind\nDon't be misled, remember what I said\nThe rhymes of rappers surely knock some sense in your head\nDUMB GIRL.. DUMB GIRL!\n\n[Run]\n(NOW..) Now you're the flyest girl, in the whole school\nBut they don't call you fly - they call you fool\nBecause you don't go to class, you will not pass\nYou like to go but you should slow because you're goin too fast\nAnd I can tell that you're dumb when you walk in the place\nWalkin round with your thumb cold stuck in your face\nAlways sinnin never winnin cause you're last in the race\nYou get high and tell a lie and think that makes you the ace\nDUMB GIRL.. (stupid!) THE GIRL IS..\n\n[Run]\nNow you're a stupid sex fiend, with no will power (POWER)\nHit four guys in the bathroom at your last baby shower\n\n[D.M.C.]\nAll the guys call you fast (FAST) but I call you slow (SLOW)\nAlways sniffin or givin (GIVIN) somebody a blow (BLOW)\nGivin every guy a try (TRY) at the wink of an eye (EYE)\nThere's somethin that you're missin, that money can't buy (BUY)\nWhen it comes to love, you're even hated by Cupid (CUPID)\nYou're (silly) dilly (dumb) and you're JUST PLAIN STUPID!\nDUMB GIRL.. (stupid!) DUMB GIRL!\n\n.. the girl is ..\n\n[D.M.C.]\nI hope you to listen to the words, that I speak\nI'm not playin, what I'm sayin, can never be weak\nYou should use your brain, but you don't have one\nAnd when it comes to sense you don't have none\nYO YO you should know where I'm comin from\nBut you're just dumb (diddy) dumb (diddy diddy) DUMB DUMB!\n\n[D] DUMB GIRL!\n[R] Dumb with a capital D!\n[D] DUMB GIRL!\n[R] Stupid as can be, BREAKDOWN!\n\n.. the girl is ..\n\nDUMB GIRL!

D that's me, the King, the MC\nRhyme get mine on the t-o-p\nCan another MC ever **** with me? (Hell no!)\n\n[Run-D.M.C.]\nIt's like the A the B to the C\nIt's easier than (1, 2, 3)\n(He's Jam Master Jay, I'm D.M.C.)\nSo hit it Run!\nIt's time for we to cease (So what?)\nSo rhymers speak your peace\nWhy? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)\nCause he's number (1, 2, 3, 4, hit it)\n(Let's dance) to the rhythm, the rhyme, the cold flow\nChance that I gave em is done I told yo\nFor these routines like 1983\nIt's just a little reminder\nSo those suckas is kinder\nA little message from (Run-D.M.C.)\n\n[Run]\nCuts for days will amaze and maze\nBut will make you sad to tan all the dance aways\nGot the mic, the man, the master plan\nBut the ram, the jam\n(Know I am?) Goddamn!\nSpins he wins, clocking endless ends\nTo his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends\nJay lose today, this is what I say\n(Dick in your mouth all day)\n\n[D.M.C.]\nMy beats were played and laid rhymes made\nJay DJ'ed and I got paid\nMade something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)\nYes my brother I would do it for you\nI roam in the zone of the microphone\nAnd I'm on the throne but I'm not alone\nGot bones of steel and not of stone\nI'm known to be prone and make your momma moan\n\n[Run]\nTime for the rhyme so let the stars shine\nShame for the fame and the name combined\nRun for the fun but you can gimme your ring\nShow I gotta go so now a word from the King\n\n[D.M.C.]\nHardcore, rhymes galore, giving you more\nAnd like I said before...\nBeats to the rhyme the name of this jam\nD that's me and that's who I am\nRocking on the mic cause you know I can\nYou gotta understand I don't give a damn!\n\n[Run]\nJay here to play today, I must say\nArranged in the way that is A-OK\nAs we wax the tracks all the DJ's play\nWith (dick in your mouth)\nA little (dick in your mouth)\nA big (dick in your mouth all day)"

Give up the dough!\nGive up the dough on Christmas, YO!\nGive up the dough! Give up the dough!\nGive up the dough! - HERE WE GO! HERE WE GO!\n\n[D.M.C.]\nI'm from the ghetto, now this mean I get\nNo toys or presents beneath my tree\nI wrote my list, I made my wish\nIs this what Christmas means to me?\nNo snowflakes droppin, can't go shoppin\nRhymes I'm a-poppin, to keep the hip-hhoppin\nWhy can't a Santa +Pause+ for the cause?\nI'm gettin mine, you gettin yours\nThat's how Christmas is supposed to be\nA very merry Christmas for everybodyy\nFight poverty, give to the needy\nDon't be like The Grinch cause The Grinch, is greedy\nDeck, the malls with bows of holly\n'Tis the season to be jolly\nNo presents for my tree yet\nAnd I don't even know if any gifts I'm gonna get\nHappy holidays not like a lotta days\nA few here, a few there, a new year\nSeason greetings are the reasons for the cheer\nIf Santa Claus, is coming to town\nHope it's my chimney he's coming down\nOn Christmas, because Christmas is\nOn Christmas, because Christmas is\n\n[Chorus]\n(HERRRRE WE GO, FLOW!)\n\n[Run]\nHa-have a, very merry merry, and hurry\nAnd if you'll need a leader, Run'll be there for your flurry\nBlurry sight, and write, a rhyme for the night\nChristmas is the time for giving not for the type\nSo open, your pockets, your heart, unlock it\nDollars train from Hollis, I give it like I clock it\nCold as the weather, minus the humidity\nDon't mistake, harmonies and kindness for timidity\nChristmas, this must, be the time of year\nLeggo of your Eggo, rather ego, me go there\nAnd here, my dear, so give a kid a beer\nCause every time you give, it's coming back, let's get it clear\nI'll be scopin, and hopin, brothers lend a ear\nSo have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\n\n[Chorus]\n[Outro: kid]\nYeah, that's right! Give up the dough!\nI want my Ninja Turtles! I want my bike!\nI want my Sega Genesis! I want my Nintendo!\nAnd turn my mommy lights back on! (Word up)"

From 1983 to 2000. It\u2019s 2001 and these niggas still on the run? Y\u2019all, niggas, just crazy, y\u2019all out here tryin\u2019 to front, like\u2026 they ain\u2019t the reason, you went and bought a pair of shelltoe. The fuck is wrong witch\u2019all?\n\n[Verse 2: Rev Run]\nPeople wanna hurt Rev Run, say cause I got dough\nThat I must be a type of fraud\nBut you know the thing that\u2019s funny, this garden ain\u2019t money\nThen how rich is the lawn\nWent got JD, made me crazy\nPlay me up in the club\nGot a brand new Mercedes, for my lady\nBut see me, I\u2019m older\nTo the Bentley and all that come out the garage\nOn the side of a grand prestigous home\nY\u2019all ask if I\u2019m blessed by God, player what you thought?\nWhat Rev you seen on chrome?\nGotta make these dollars, comin\u2019 out of Hollis\nGot my collar on too\nI got the rhyme and the beat and the vibe from the street\nAnd now the rest is on you\n\n[Interlude: Jermaine Dupri]\nThe rest is on me man. Let me let y\u2019all know somethin\u2019. The first rap group to get on MTV, hard heavy, ya heard me? And then, they gon\u2019 turn around, and resurrect Aerosmith like\u2026 You know what I mean, boy, ain\u2019t enough of that, knahmsayin? If it wasn\u2019t for these cats, man. Y\u2019all wouldn\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about no LL Cool J or Beastie Boys, y\u2019knahmean? And this comin\u2019 from me, I\u2019m lookin\u2019 at it, man, since I been 13 years old man, I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 these cats, man.

Yeah!\n\n[Verse 3: Run, (Jermaine Dupri)]\nForget the hits that I made or the gig that I played\nIf you had love back in the day (That\u2019s right)\nJust raised up my kicks and I changed what I spit\nAnd returned as the Run y\u2019all love today (Yeah)\nI pick the mic back up, came right back up\nTo the top where I\u2019m \u2018posed to be (\u2018Posed to be)\nAnd when the track light up, y\u2019all can back right up\nY\u2019all players too close to me\n\n[Outro: Jermaine Dupri]\nYou know what I used to like? The way my man used to come on stage and grab the mic. And just throw the damn stand across the stage, man. Then he used to tell his man like, \u201cYo, D, come right here in the middle of the stage, grab yo\u2019 shit and say what you gotta say\u201d. And you know what D used to say? He used to say, \u201cParty people! Your dreams have now been fulfilled, get out your seats, and let\u2019s get ill. That\u2019s right y\u2019all, we\u2019re not just rough, we more than tough.

   "lyrics": "Two years ago a friend of mine\nAsked me to say some emcee rhymes\nSo I said this rhyme I'm about to say\nThe rhyme was Def and it went this way\nTook a test to become an emcee\nAnd Orange Krush became amazed at me\nSo Larry put me inside his Cadillac\nThe chauffeur drove off and we never came back\nDave cut the record down to the bone\nAnd now they got me rockin' on the microphone\nAnd then we're talking autographs, years of laughs\nChampagne, caviar, and bubble baths\nYou see, that's the life that I lead, and\nYou sucker MC, this is who I be\nSo take that and move back, catch a heart attack\nBecause there's nothing in the world, that Run will ever lack\nI cold chill at a party in a be -boy's stance\nAnd rock on the mike and make the girls want to dance\nFly like a dove, they come from up above\nI'm rockin on the mike and you can call me Run Love\nI got a big long Caddy not like a Seville\nAnd written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'\nSo if you see me cruisin' girls just move or step aside\nThere ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride\nIt's on a, ah first come, first serve basis\nCoolin out girl, take you to the def places\nOne of a kind and for your people's delight\nAnd for you sucker emcee, you just ain't right\nBecause you're bitin all your life, you're cheatin on your wife\nYou're walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife\nYou're hangin on the ave, chillin' with the crew\nAnd everybody know what you've been through\nAh with the one two three, three to two one\nMy man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run\nWe do it in the place with the highs and the bass\nI'm rockin to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face\nGo Uptown and come down to the ground\nYou sucker emcee's, you sad face clown\nYou're a five-dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man\nYou're a sucker emcee, and you're my fan\nYou try to bite rhymes, all lines are mine\nYou're a sucker emcee in a pair of Calvin Kleins\nComin' from the wackest part of town\nTryin to rap but you can't get down\nYou don't even know your English, your verbs or noun\nYou're just a sucker emcee you sad-faced clown\nSo DMC if you're ready, the people rockin' steady\nYou're drivin big cars, get your gas from Getty\nI'm DMC in the place to be, I go to St. John's University\nAnd since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge\nAnd after 12th grade I went straight to college\nI'm light skinned, I live in Queens\nAnd I love eatin chicken and collard greens\nI dress to kill, I love to style\nI'm the emcee you know who's versatile\nSay I got good credit in your regards\nGot my name not numbers on my credit cards\nI go Uptown, I come back home\nWith who? me myself and my microphone\nAll my rhymes are street delight\nSo here's another one for why'all to bite\nWhen I rhyme I never quit\nAnd if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it\n'Cause it takes a lot to entertain\nAnd sucker emcee's can be a pain\nYou can't rock a party with a hip and a hop\nYou gotta let em know you'll never stop\nThe rhymes have to make a lot of sense\nYou got to know when to start (when the beats commence..."

I must be dreaming\nEverybody's ?? when I see men dealing\nFor a rhyme or rope, or a dime of coke\nSometimes I rhyme when I'm crying broke\nMany many many records broke laws, broke jaws\nA few months ago I had to \"Pause\"\nDuring that time, me and my man\nWas chilling on the corner with a quart in our hands\nA beef broke out, at Soul Kitchen spot\nIt was crazy Baby Pop, someone got shot\nI seen him drop - then came the cops\nSayin, \"Nobody run - everybody stop\"\nI wanted to run, cause I was carryin my gun\nDarryl Mack packin mine, strapped with my nine\nEveryone on the wall, that's what the cop said\nEveryone complied, except Bald Dread, he said\n\"Blood claat boi me nah hafa deal wit dat\nYo I'm a superstar for de world dem call 'I'm Darryl Mack\"\nI turned around and said, \"Word up cop!\"\nHe said, \"D.M.C., take your ass down the block\"\nIf it happened to him, it could happen to you\nCause that's what's happenin on The Avenue\nWhen I.. \"uhh, uhh uhh, uhh.. uhh..\"\n\"Na-na-na-na-na! The Ave.\"\n\n[Verse 2: Run]\nNow on The Ave. (what?) people steal and they dealin away\nI got the feelin the illin will never ever pay\nCause on the street, you're never in the fast lane\nYou go to jail or get a bullet in your brain\nPeople laugh and smile at a stick-up\nA young man in a rut, shakin a big cup\nPeople pass his ass and say, \"Tough luck\"\nTo waste time for a dime is cold fucked up\nA loud shot in the air - not rare\nA brother fell to the ground, nobody cares\nYou ask why, the baby cry, a man laugh\nNobody give a damn, that's how they livin on The Ave\n... AUUUGH!\n\n[Verse 3: D.M.C.]\nAway from The Ave. they have what's called the backstreets\nAnother world of girls that crawl the backseats\nSystems that are kickin, sinkin many black beats\n(This and that goin on ??? street)\nI remember the time there was a jam in ???\n??, the music, no ?? til after dark\nThat's when the shit starts happening\n(Brother from The Ave. this and that again)\nBody move in the back and a quarter in the jar\nFind the rules by the basketball court in the park\nAnd the ? by the bench where the 40 dogs spark\nThe crowd crowds around like they found Noah's Ark\nThe young, hung, and swung on a swing\nGlidin and slidin and ride the ding-a-ling\nI didn't see a kid by the see, so he saw\n(Near the monkey bars, funky cars we adore)\nI'm throwin fate to the gate ?? ??\n(And my man from Japan got vicked for sure)\nDo me a favor when you roll with your crew\nYou gotta check out, check out, The Avenue"

Jay to the telly music, loud as hell\nHe said - \"Hold up Run,\" *DING DONG*, \"it's the bell!\"\nJay to the door as he leaves the cut\nFor his eyes a surprise, \"D.M.C. WHASSUP?\"\n\n[D.M.C.]\nI need a little help Jay, I got a little problem\nA guy like yourself, maybe you can help me solve em\nI only want to know why this happens all the time\n(What?)  Everywhere I go, I start to rap and rhyme\nI rock them in the day (yeah you rock em every night)\nI rock em when I left so def I knew something was wrong (alright)\nI rhyme when I am sleeping, I rhyme when I'm awake\nWhen I was nine I said a rhyme by putting candles on my cake\nI just came from the bank (you said a rhyme?) A rhyme so funny\nA song about the line so long they all gave me their money\nThat's why I came to you, you're my friend (yes that is true)\nSaid maybe Jay knows what to say, he'll tell me what to do..\n\n[Jay]\nHmmmm.. yo you go get Joe, and all the rhymes you made\nAnd we'll go to the bank, AND WE CAN ALL GET PAID!\n\n[Run]\nCruisin down the block, in the sixty-six Olds\nGirls are on the jock like the ride was a Rolls\nFeelin kinda great, got change for the toll\nSuckers gotta wait, that's your fate, poor soul\nHeard you on the records and I heard you on the tapes\nStop, switch the conversation over to grapes, because\nYou're not bustin none, so stop fussin son\nYou're not down with Rush, they call us Russ and Run\nSince that's the company, you won't be chumpin me\nHere's the man, ask that fan (Run big brother D!)"

As we come back on..\nAs we come back on..\nAll in your face, I place this rhyme!\nFacin this crew, you're facin your doom\nYou got punched in the face\nAs soon as you heard this tune!\n\nI race at a pace with no shoelaces\nTo racist faces, placin disgraces\nTaste the bass of the racial facial\nDisgraceful tasteless racist faces\nGet out my face, don't bass, don't waste my time\nMy brother, I'm not color blind\nI walk the face of the Earth, face death\nFace the best and I'll just\nRip flip and trip won't shut up or let up\nGet out my face so we can go head up\n(Damn D!) Yo yo yo they don't understand me\n?? when they always try to ban me\nHypin the stereotype of a face\nAnd that's the problem with the human race\nHaste makes waste, don't trace to other places\nWe're all the same but with different faces\n\n..\n\n[Jay]\nYeah D, and everywhere I go I see faces\nFaces sweatin you and they sweatin faces\nAround around the world, international faces\nYeah, now bust it\n\nYo, I took a look in the face of a girlie\nThe way she looks that Jay must say\nSomethin bout the way my afro is growin\nBut is it funky? (YEAH!) Well okay\nIs she jockin my 'fro or my fade?\nDo she want me because of my name?\nI like the ladies, sweet and serious\nNot those hoes, that plays, the game\nOn every Tom Dick and Harry\nShawn Jerry John Nick Curly Moe and Larry\nYou thinkin you married?  Well you CRAZY\nMy baby you won't carry\nCause I like a girl that's low-key\nThat's how it's gotta be to be with me\nAnd I'll take her to all the exotic places\nThe name of this jam is called FACES\nYeah.. so many faces..\nAnd everywhere I go I see faces\nAnd everywhere you go you see, the faces\nInternational faces, I'm a Afro and I'm outta here..\n\n[ad libs to fade]"

M. C. And we're tougher than leather\nWe're making and breaking and snatching and taking\nThe deal's for real we could never be faking\n\n[d. M. C.]\nI'm chilling, he's cooling, I'm a king that's ruling\nPreach and teach and always schooling\n\n[run]\nSee, we're learning, and earning, the tables keep turning\nTo be like us, you could cold be yearning\nPulsating dominating up above\nCold chilling and I'm willing, the name's run-love\n\n[d.

M. C. My man, to the break of dawn rock\n\n[d. M. C.]\nI'm ill, I chill, with skill I kill\nAnd none of my rhymes are run of the mill\nI cause grief, I'm chief, there is no beef\nAnd if there's beef I knock out teeth\nMc's act dumb, they know where I'm from\nThe king from queens and I'm down with run\n\n[run]\nI take a stand my man, and I won't sit\nCause I'm the real deal, like coke is it\nThen you won't find my name in the yellow page\nCause run only speaks when it's on the stage\nI got a rhyme in line that's easy to find\nWith a sketch so check, so one of a kind\nGot two mc's and one dj\nGrab at least 20 g's when we play\nSo D. M. C. My boy, my mellow my man\nSo get on the mic and won't you take the stand\n\n[d. M. C.]\nMy rock is hard, you can't pull my card\nI'm a shining star, shining near and far\nShining like the sun on a day of fun\nAlways on the move cause I'm down with run\nI'm the cool and calm, I'm the calm and cool\nI'm not a fool, I went to school\nMy name is D. M. C. I tell no lie\nAnd I graduated from cooley high\nI am the only rapper who will not die\nI'm a greusome guy, and you can try\nTo battle D. M. C. But you must be high"

Darryl Mack, you're all of that\nThey pray they can save the crazy rat\nThey attack to mack to move him off the map\nCould never tell I fell, to hell and back\nIt's beautiful -- the mic makes hits\nTo the dirty, stinkin, son of a.... (auuuuuuhh)\nI'm mad and bad and sad and highly upset\nSo don't do nothin that you might regret\nCause I'll stomp that ass, like a little insect (c'mon)\nClean off my kicks (c'mon) clean off my kicks (c'mon)\nClean off my kicks and then STEP!\n(stiggidy-stick, step!)\n\nChorus One\n\nChorus Two: Run-D.M.C\n\nSo they all rolled over and one fell out\nWe put two in the head\nAnd the little one said, roll over, roll over!\n\"Do or die!\"\nWe put two in the head\nAnd the little one said..\n\n[Run]\nNow c'mon step to me do me pursue me you never knew me\nYou'll be sleepin and you slept on the step\nAnd now your crew be sweatin me like you're sweatin the sweat\nAnother groupie dissin D, now you're back on the set\nI'm makin em takin em breakin em all\nDiss em one by one\nYou make the mistake of thinkin I'm soft\nThinkin Run ain't the one\nFrom eighty-three and they be seein me and D and they front\n?? the suckers from the ruckus that's about to become\nReel it back, come REWIND it's about that time\nFeelin wack, ate the swine it's about that swine\nIn your body couldn't keep up at the end of the set\nBet ya beat ya that I teach ya and you're stuck until death\n(That's what I'm sayin)\n\nChorus One\n\nChorus Three: Run-D.M.C\n\nWe put two in the head\nAnd the little one said\nWe put one in the head\nAnd the little one said, roll over, roll over!\n\"Do or die!\"\n\n{\u200b\u200b*Jam Master Jay cuts*}\u200b\u200b\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do.. or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\" \"Do..\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\" .."

So..\nCheck out my records, I make my message clear\nIn this direction, where do we go from here?\n\n[Mad Cobra reggae Hook + chatta]\n\n[Run]\nNow bust it pen to the hand I am the grand writer\nWrote a plan for you ma'am and damn, beautiful\nTo make you move to my groove is here\nSo my dear be of good cheer I make it perfectly clear\nNot number two you're the one when all is said and is done\nSerious as the cancer give a answer to Run, so..\nCheck out my records, I make my message clear\nIn this direction, where do we go from here?\n\n[Mad Cobra reggae Hook]\n\n[D.M.C.]\nI kick the lyrics strictly wreckin the head\nNot forgetten what is written, stickin to what is said\nWhen D is MC'n there's no bein mislead\nGot to have her and like Shabba I am wicked in bed (hehehehe)\nThe woman made me wonder, she's the one I will wed\nSo I turned to the ??, and a dis is what I said\nI said give me your number I'mma give you a call\nCheck it out y'all, check it out y'all\nCheck out my records, I make my message clear\nIn this direction, where do we go from here?\n\n[Mad Cobra continued]"

STOP!\n\n[Run]\nSee them on the corner, scheamin a scam\nMakin plans beat the man that'll put him in ?amb's?\nCut for the loot to group, hit a troop or bank\nNo thanks to the brothers in blue\nFreeze stay at ease, nigga get to your knees\nSeen cash in the back, about a hundred G's\nStep to the next, got a scam with checks\nCold stole a bankroll from plenty of ?? then\nUp to The Ave., a cab to the lab\nTo make a stop to drop off the money in the bag\nAnd then send a friend that's been down\nTo do a job to rob a brother in town\nLivin and givin a damn, two different things\nThe brother dig diamond rings\nIt's not about makin the money, but the money is taken\nShake em down, flip em out, then break em\nHe'll break a leg, to get the money\nA diggy diggy don't forget he'll break a law, seen\nAin't a damn thing funny bout a nigga named Sonny\nBut the brother's about to get naughty\n\n\tThe brother's about to get naughty! (4X)\n\n[D.M.C.]\nStarin and tearin in my direction\nSelection is vexin, I brought protection\nSuspicious, frisk us, ? has to diss us\nScoldin and holdin me 'gainst my wishes\nSearchin my ride, my body, my soul\nTryin to find some kind of substance control\nMaybe someone is carryin a gun\nNo, nothing, no one has none\nGloomy and sorry when I come clean\nYo officer, what does this mean?\nMy system is loud and I draw a crowd\nNot only King, I'm black and I'm proud\nThis ride is mine, do you mind if I own\nSo stop tryin to rob mines and leave me alone\nThe officer said I saw you before\nComin out the door of a grocery store\nI said to my partner there goes a man\nAnd he's got a trouble starter, inside his hand\nMy man Eric Blam said stop on the cops\nAnd then what the Blam said, you're sure to get shot\nNow they ignore me cause you saw me with a 40\nHe thought the brothers were about to get naughty\n\n\tThe brother's about to get naughty! (4X)\n\n[Run]\nHow ya livin on the ill side, makin a livin\nDriven, never givin a damn about the women and\nIf this is life, your wife, you're livin trife\nFor spite you hit the pipe every night and just fight\nYou're naughty, make a girl get physical\nShe get loose for juice and then you diss her\nPull and take another girl on a escapade\nA trip around the world a what a mess you made\nAnother lady, gravy, maybe you're crazy\nYou see ? ?? today, you don't faze me\nBut gettin kinda hectic on the power tip\nA brother gotta pay no matter how it get\n\nFace the facts, base the crack\nTaste the stacks last, and these suckers are back\nSo when you see the company that claim to be\nThe truth you done get raw, see\nCheck out the three, Run-D.M.C\nAnd the brothers about to get naughty!\n\n\tThe brother's about to get naughty! (4X)\n\n[???]\nOpen up the door and let the brothers in\nCause it's a sin, if we ain't down, on what's happenin\nYo what's up, you don't like the way I walk\nOr I guess it's, just the way I talk or are you prejudiced\nInvited to the show, threw on my afro\nJumped out the limo, get to the front, you tell me no\nYo I just came to mingle, watch the earrings jingle\nGrab a cutie rub-a-dub 'til it tingle\nBut you wanna single me out, but I ain't did that\nCheck me, I ain't strapped, pull the barricade back\nI'm comin in black, I know you're hard dick\nSix foot bodyguard, but why should I be barred\nYo, yo, pass the 40\nCool T, Hurricane, Run and D's about to get naughty..\n\n\tThe brother's about to get naughty!
