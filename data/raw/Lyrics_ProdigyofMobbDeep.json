  "plain": "Albert Johnson (November 2, 1974 \u2013 June 20, 2017), better known by his stage name Prodigy, was a rapper, producer, actor and author who was one half of the hip-hop duo Mobb Deep with Havoc.\n\nProdigy and Havoc released their debut album, Juvenile Hell, in 1993, but became household names with the success of their classic 1995 sophomore album, The Infamous, which features two of their most popular singles, \u201cShook Ones Pt. II\u201d and \u201cSurvival of the Fittest.\u201d Their next two albums, Hell on Earth (1996) and Murda Muzik (1999), were also critically acclaimed, with high praise placed on Prodigy\u2019s lyricism.\n\nHe released his first solo album, H.N.I.C., in 2000, which features his most popular solo single, \u201cKeep It Thoro,\u201d produced by The Alchemist. Prodigy and The Alchemist also released a couple of collaboration albums together: Return of the Mac (2007) and Albert Einstein (2013).\n\nProdigy was involved in his share of controversies. He had public feuds with 2Pac, Jay-Z, Nas, Keith Murray, and even his own partner Havoc at one point. He also spent three years in prison on a weapon possession charge. He sparked more controversy after the release of his book My Infamous Life in 2012, where he detailed many different situations he encountered.\n\nSadly, Prodigy passed away on June 20, 2017 at the age of 42."

It don't matter on the color of your skin\nRight now you either positive or you negative\nI got friends in high places, multiple races\nAnd coaches on my side, all you got is paper\n\n[Hook]\nIlluminati want my mind, soul and my body\nSecret Society trying to keep their eye on me\nBut I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me\nMake my moves strategically\nIlluminati want my mind, soul and my body\nSecret Society trying to keep their eye on me\nBut I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me\nMake my moves strategically"

I told you bring the gun\n(Yeah, I remember) Nah, listen, without me you'd be a memory\nI'm the one you could come to for guidance\nBring you home alive when you wildin'\nKept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray\nTold you when it's time to put it away\nAnd when the cops came, you was safe\n\n[Verse 4: Prodigy]\nWithout question, I stay aware, dunn, I'm listenin'\nEverytime we speak it's real, I know your intentions\nIs to make sure we both safe and livin', and breathin'\nYou gets all respect from me, dunn, believe it\n\n[Verse 5: Prodigy's Conscience]\nYo, we got kids to raise and bills to pay\nEnemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us\n(What about the clique?) Now, if you die, is they comin'?\nWhen you shot do they feel the bullet?\nAnd when you broke can they fix it? Aight then, you keep writin'\nAnd let me do the thinkin', I brought us this far without mistaken\n\n[Verse 6: Nas]\nVoices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin'\nCautions I shoulda took heed, lost in my weed, steady losin'\nThug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed\nWhores on they knees, fuckin' with millionaires, killers and thieves\nI fuck until there's no feelin' where I bust and I pee\nI lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep\nI stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God 'cause he\nSay when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness\nFuck the cash, the ice\nFerraris with two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right\nSee niggas smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back\nSnakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back\nWhy's it like that? It's life, black, and this is the game\nThe way I see it: Both bitches and niggas, is the same\nI trust myself, I can't fuck myself\nWhen hoes leave and no weed, I still know me, just myself\nFear is weakness, learn from what experience teaches\nBeware of leeches, the vampires, my secrets\nNever follow, 'cause most niggas is straight up cowards\nTake care of my body's the temple, my mind is the power"

If I do, then this here was written for you\n'Cause you could never feel the pain, nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nNah, you can never feel my pain, nigga\nCould never feel my pain, nigga\nNever feel the pain, nigga\nYou could never feel the pain, nigga\nNah, never feel the pain, nigga"

Fuck time is it man\n(It's like 3 o'clock, man, thought you was coming to get me, man!?!)\nShit, my bad son\n(Please, man, come get me man, before I choke this bitch, man!\nHurry up son, man it's like 90 man, let's get some hoes or something)\nCome on, Come on\n\nWhat up, dun\nSame ol' shit\nNo doubt, ain't nothing new...\nLet's take a little spin, dun, word up\n\n[Verse 1: Prodigy]\nYo... open my wings to a new day spread my lungs\nGet laced, jump in the whip, stash the guns\nTwist the key, shifted to D then flee\nBefore anything, get the daily dose of choke\nWe got the Benzo flooded with smoke on the float\nMy eye's burnin' from the dope killin' my throat\nLean my seat back and taste, lumbar support\nOn the belt doin' 90 or more\nDebatin' on the latest rhyme wars\nWhere units don't count\nBut your rap pay add up to large amounts\nGet my thrills puttin' other nigga's skills to sleep\nCatch chills off a infamous beats\nSwing the trees doin' one-handed u'ees\nBlowin' on the ouwee cause we can't have the medicine canoein'\nThere go the boys to the right, no days and nights like that\nAy yo dunn, hold that down and turn it around\nDirty as fuck, thugs drugs and guns, D's and fatigues\nT n T hopin' out of MPV's\nSurprise all fuck out of me\nGot rubber Glocks pointed at me\nAy yo Twin, what the fuck\n\n[Verse 2: Twin Gambino]\nThey had us layed out on the ground holdin' us down\nWith gats to back of our heads was goin' down\n\"It wasn't us that held up that bitch you got\nWhere's the proof, man, let me speak to my attorney.\"\nI know the routine, don't try to throw me\nI been gettin' knocked since 12 and my moms tried to scold me\nBut all that told me to get in more shit\nAy yo P, (what up) you my co-d, we both get knocked\nWhat you did with that half'a tree? (right in my sock.)\nYo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot\nDunn, you know how I get down\nYo I'm ready to bounce\nDo the 100 yard-dash and tear ass\nIf my other half was alive we woulda got killt\n'cause dunn woulda went for the guns and got ill\nPlus I got cracks on me, they found the cracks on me\nLooked at 'em, gave 'em back to me\nI could've swore they was takin' us in\nThen the lady in the car said, \"that's not them.\"\nPicked us up, told me I could keep the drugs\nThey didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns\nAnd you ain't gotta tell us twice\nWe hopped in the car and slid off\nOn our way uptown for more of that funk\nP lit the tree back up\nGot off the Triborough, hit the Henry Huds'\n\"Fuck it, let's slide through the Ruckers.\"\nRoll the windows down cuz Infamous Mobb bumpers...\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nSkip To My Lou had the crowd jumpin'\nTook a walk through the park frontin'\nDidn't even have to hurt nuttin'\nMan I love it, ain't nothin' like summer in New York\nHear Infamous Thoughts, then the Dream Team music starts\nDamn, we young black entrepreneurs\nNew York Pricks and Dicks can't stop our floss\nWe like organized crime, the fuckin' Mobb\nI'm only twenty-six playin' wit' serious cards\nDead serious cash, luxurious labs\nLearn to balance pain with fame, you can't complain\n\n[Chorus: Chinky]\nJust another day, livin' in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeelin' good today\nOh no we can't complain\nJust another day livin' in New York\nDealin' with the jakes and the snakes\nFeelin' good today\nWe hit 'em up cuz we here to stay"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMemories play back like film\nI flash back we was little niggas living most real\n1989's when we first met\nWe first clicked over convo gettin twisted\nIn dun gram earth crib cutting outta school\nWatching cable it seemed like the over day\nThrough the eyes of a stranger we was kids\nBut in our own minds we was grown mens\nOutside on the block we would play the bench\nAnd y'all play the rock every chance y'all got\nAs I sat back and just watched\nHey, what can I say?\nThe same back then as I am today\nI can recall me, Jamil and Jamal\nIn the room drinking straight vodka with they moms\nWhen I walk home with the big nefertiti charm\nBack with the light blue camoflauge suit god\nMe and Hav' doing it hard trying to get on\nWe sample songs on the box with record and pause\nKilla B didn't even get his first firearm\nAnd I was still holding one shot derringers\n\n[Chorus]\nWho would think anyone of us would cease to exist\nLeft with just thoughts of the past to reminisce\nSometimes I see a chick walking past with ya kids\nOr find an old flicka of some 1-2-fifth\nAll the shit that we been through it boils to this?\nDun, I wish we could start it all over again\n\n[Verse 2]\n95 we on top touring the states\nA lotta times we even took the click overseas\nCame along way from the hallway\nSitting in the staircase with bacardi\nBring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang\nWhile we would share drinks with the other that came\nTriple L stayed taking they cash in dice games\nKilla Black grew to keep an ice grill, dun was not playin'\nYammy, the most infamous told me one day\n'Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P'\nBut it was all love, we was each others duns\nWe held each other down, borrowed each other guns\nIts hard to believe that niggas so strong\nCould die so easily forever be gone\nI could still feel the wet of your palm against mine\nCause we did our hand shake all the time\nWhy it have to be your time to go and not mines?\nSpilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin'\nAll the laughs we shared and fights we had\nAll the nights we would get nice, damn\nPlates of food we split in half\nI dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed\n\n[Chorus]\nWho would think anyone of us would cease to exist\nLeft with just thoughts of the past to reminisce\nSometimes I see a chick walking past with ya kids\nOr find an old flicka of some 1-2-fifth\nAll the shit that we been through it boils to this?\nDun, I wish we could start it all over again\n\n[Outro]\nWhat's the fuckin' deal, motherfuckin' Scarface nigga, killer for Bean, Fugi, Gooey, I can't take no more nigga, Corey, Black Ed, the fuck, knahmsayin'? I'll Will burnin'\nHarry, fuck yo, I can't take no more man\nFrankie, Spank, whattup man? Straight up\nMy grandmoms man, my granddad man\nGrandma Brooks, straight up my pops man\nStraight up man, that's it\nAll my dead, all my dead\nMan, the little babies man, no more man\nAbortion babies man, I can't take no more man\nI'll never forget you, all my dead it's all love man\nMotherfuckin' Yambo, in a minute, we'll be there\nMotherfuckin' Yammy, straight up, I can't wait\nYou was my strength nigga, I miss y'all\nI can't believe you gone nigga\n(You was supposed to be right here)\nWhat the fuck happened?\nAin't nobody else goin' away man\nYou ain't takin' nuttin' else from me man\nNobody can't take nuttin' else from me man, that's it\nI dare you! Come try, it's over man\nYou can't take nuttin' else from us yo\nThat's my word, I put my life on it I'll be next nigga, straight up\nI'll stand up for that\n'Cause ain't none of my niggas goin', that's enough\nWe had enough\nIt's the Veteran's Memorial right here man\nStraight up, man\nWe love y'all, one love"

Nah you wish!!!\n\n(Chorus) Prodigy X2\n\n(P talking w/ a friend)"

(What do they), this is fact not theory\nYeah, that rapper got money\nBut that rapper can't walk through this concrete jungle 'cause he doin' it wrong\nNew York belongs to Don P\nYou could have the rest of the world, I'm good (Strong) with these streets\nSkyscrapers and housin' buildings\nI know about London but I prefer Brooklyn\nI know about Marseilles but I prefer Queens\nAnd while you hire cops (What do they), I prefer my team\nI got a powerful army, it's no need for a gun\nYou want hardcore rap? You fuckin with the right one\nThis is maximum strength, there's no need for drugs\nYou want reality rap, homie, you got the right one\nI'm\n\n[Chorus: Nina Simone & Prodigy]\nStrong enough to take the pain\nInflicted again and again\nWhat do they call me?\nMy name is Str-Strong, (You know what?)

Diddy, my relentless drive\nTo thrive and prosper, made (Strong) me\n\n[Chorus: Nina Simone]\nStrong enough to take the pain\nInflicted again, and again\nWhat do they call me?\nMy name, is Str-Strong, Strong\nWhat do they\nStrong"

They lost one\nFelt down the side of my forearm was wet\nAww shit, take the pain and bleed\nEmergency'll call the D's\nGrab the Codeine and swallow half the bottle\nGet treatment out in Long Island, tomorrow\n\nDedicated to K.B. and Yambo, the Scarface Twin\nTo all my niggas that won\u2019t think twice to sacrifice your precious life\nWord up! My nighttime niggas, during the sun\u2019s hour, keep your head up\nNigga, what? Word up!\nMy true-to-life thunns\nYeah\u2026"

You might wanna cry\nHe got a problem with P? He might wanna die\nWhile I'm, so lovable and so humble\nThat if you cross me, then you deserve to stumble\nAnd fall on a Rambo knife\nLook homey, you obviously don't know me, I'm\n\n[Chorus: repeat 4X]\nThe one and only, Infamous, notorious\n[Prodigy]\nI'm Bandana P, the fantastic one\nReptile, I spit acid, they kyan't done\nI die harder than your average die hardheaded nigga\nI don't learn 'til it's too late, and it's early nigga\nI don't take orders, fold, or break under pressure\nI don't take kindly to strangers or new faces\nIt might be the police\nMaybe the D.A. brothers, come to get me\n... I've got a dark sense of humor\nGotta calm down a lot, I, got a hot temper\n... I'm tryin to change\nBut these people out here push me to engage\nIn all types of fuckery, jealous and they envious\nMisery love company they don't really love me~!\nI had to sever our ties\nSit back in my jacuzzi watchin pelicans fly\nThinkin back how we used to be on the same page\nI realize now, that you nothin like me, I'm\n\n[Chorus]\n[Prodigy]\nMy reign at the top don't stop, it's endless\nWatch me crush so-called competition, man listen\nThere is no threat to my position\nThese niggas is harmless, there's no comparison, to\nRap's top shotter, best sellin author\nIn non-fiction, you better pray I go easy\nAnd thank me for not exposin your bumba claat\nI could go in on you, but I'm not\nSuccess is the best revenge\nAnd I'm fit to show you people how to do this here\nIntelligent, smooth criminal music\nYou never lived this life, you can't relate to it\nI'm the chief of all chiefs, the Don of all dons\nThe boss of all bosses, the fuckin warlord\nThe grand wizard of bars\nWhen I die, my tombstone'll read \"He was...\"\n\n[Chorus]"

   "lyrics": "I loved when I had visitors, especially my family. A few friends came too, but whenever my family made that trip, I made sure my uniform was tight. I\u2019d \u201ciron\u201d the uniform under the bed. That\u2019s where everybody ironed their clothes.\n\nYou get two uniforms, so you keep one under the bed for your visit, so by the time the visit comes, it\u2019s nice and fresh because you been sleeping on it all week. That\u2019s like your visit uniform. During the rest of the week, nobody cares. On the visitors\u2019 floor, when my kids used to visit me with my wife, they had vending machines where you could get snacks and chips and everything that they don\u2019t have in commissary.\n\nPeople couldn\u2019t wait for the visit because then you could have like, hot wings you could put in the microwave! They got ill shit you could get in the vending machine. They had hot sandwiches and other food you could put in the microwave: ill snacks, doughnuts, a lot of things. Just things they don\u2019t have on the inside. They had this spicy chicken sandwich, and the name of it was Big Ass Chicken Sandwich. That was the name of it, yo! It was a spicy chicken sandwich like the one at Wendy\u2019s.\n\nIt was a spicy chicken patty, it had real jalape\u00f1os on it, and it really was a Big Ass Chicken Sandwich. It was about $4 or something like that. That was my favorite thing to eat. At every visit, I would get the Big Ass Chicken Sandwich. They also had the Big Ass Burger too. It would say it right on the package \u2013 Big Ass Burger.\n\nYou can\u2019t sneak it back up, though. They gotta strip search you. They gotta look in your butthole and all that. You gotta lift your nuts, cough, all that shit.\n\nAfter a while, I told my wife not to come because it was an 8-hour drive \u2013 four hours up to Mid-State and four hours back down. I didn\u2019t want her doing all that driving, you know what I mean? So I was like, \u201cDon\u2019t come. Just come when you feel like it, holidays or whatever. That drive is too long.\u201d Plus in the wintertime, it\u2019s bad up there. It\u2019s crazy. You know how many times after visiting the prison, people\u2019s families would be like, \u201cYo, we got into a car accident and our car flipped over!\u201d I used to tell them, \"Don\u2019t come up here. Come if you really feel like coming. Don\u2019t come thinking I need a visit, because I don\u2019t give a fuck. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nSo this producer me and Havoc did music with named King Benny, it just so happened that motherfucker lived in the town where the jail was at in Utica, and he\u2019d come and visit me every weekend. He lived five minutes from the jail. So I had a visit every weekend, and a Big Ass Chicken sandwich every weekend, sometimes a Big Ass Burger. It was crazy.\n\nHe hooked me up with real kicks too. We could order sneakers, but they was corny. They had bootleg Jordans in jail. They had a bootleg catalog with fake ass Jordans, fake Timbs, fake everything, because you can\u2019t have nothing that\u2019s over $50. They want to see the receipt from the store it came from.\n\nSo he used to kick sneakers under the table for me. I would buy them fake joints and wear them, he would come to the prison with new real J\u2019s on in my size. And while we were sitting, we\u2019d kick the shoes to each other under the table\u2014I\u2019d put on the real J\u2019s and he would put on the fake ones.\n\nOne time we did it, and we almost got caught. My man Benny is sitting right there in front of me, his back to the guards. I had to sit facing the guards. So I gotta look normal while I\u2019m taking off my sneakers and look like I\u2019m not doing nothing. I kicked my sneakers off, gave it to him. He kicked his sneakers off, kicked it to me, and one of the sneakers went flying to the side, almost to the next visiting table! I\u2019m like oh shit!\n\nMy boy tried to kick it over. I thought we was gonna get caught! We didn\u2019t though, but I looked pretty sus tryin\u2019 to act like nothin\u2019 was goin\u2019 on. But didn\u2019t matter, because I got some new J\u2019s. And I had a Big Ass Chicken Sandwich.\nFrom commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook published by Infamous Books.\n\nYou can download the audio version of commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook for free on Amazon"

He knew one of my mans on the street, and was like, \u201cYo I know so-and-so!\u201d And I was like, \u201cAight, wassup.\u201d\n\nSo he was cooking and he was like, \u201cI want to show you how to make this shit.\u201d He was right about it being \u201cshit.\u201d It\u2019s called Prison Surprise in most prisons, and inmates modify it however they want. So I tried it, and it tasted like shit. Then I went to lay down and go to sleep hours later. All of a sudden I was feeling nauseous.\n\nI was like, why am I feeling so fucked up? I started sweating, like I was sweating bullets! I\u2019m like yo, what the fuck? Why I\u2019m sweating like this? Then I just started throwing up. I ain\u2019t know what was wrong with me, but I figured something must have been in that food I just ate. I caught the ill food poisoning or something real quick, yo. So I threw up like three times, and then they took me to the infirmary and just gave me an IV. That was my first day there!\n\nAt that point, I was like, I\u2019m never eating somebody\u2019s creation ever again. Don\u2019t make me nothing. A lot of people fuck with prison surprise. I\u2019m not one of those people. But if you wanna be stupid enough to try it, I have the recipe for you.\n\nP\u2019s Don\u2019t Try\nThis At Home\nPrison Surprise\n\u2022 Ramen noodles\n\u2022 Doritos (you could also substitute with Cheez-Its or sliced cheese)\n\u2022 Jack Mack (tuna works fine too)\n\u2022 Hot sauce\n\nOpen the can of Jack Mack, and rinse the fish off gently. Take a bowl of water and microwave it for a minute or until it boils. Throw in Ramen noodles and stir it. Grab the chips and crush them up until they\u2019re a fine powder and mix them in with cooked Ramen noodles. It\u2019ll make like a cheese sauce. Throw in the Jack Mack, and then you eat it. Good luck, yo.\nFrom commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook published by Infamous Books.\n\nYou can download the audio version of commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook for free on Amazon"

Any suggestions are welcome)\n\nYeah, just found out though\u2026\nI\u2019ll be right back, darling\n\n[Verse 1 - Prodigy]\n\nWhat\u2019s up, gorgeous, beautiful\nMy sweet sister?\nI spotted you, Out of thousands\nFrom out the crowd\nYou were glowing in the dark\nYour lights spark the most bright\nCan we conversate? Rapper tastes\nThat\u2019d be alright - Cool\nMy name is P and listen\nI ain\u2019t tryin\u2019 a G\nBut you\u2019re the most sexy\nAnd plus, you always kill me\nI saw you stressin\nWhile I was going on the stage \u2013 rapping\nBut you got it twisted\nCause you\u2019re the star of this show\nHey, let\u2019s get away\nBounce to another place\nWhere we can have space to share drinks\nWhat\u2019s up ma what you think?\nLet\u2019s make it happen\nIs it you about it?\nShould I forget about it?\nShould I forget about it, and end it now before I get shot down\nSee, Reply with those bedroom eyes, that I was the god\nShe was waiting for, for a very long time\nI told I was bouncing in the morning at nine\nLet\u2019s take advantage of the moment, while we still have time\nSpring colors got you looking like a piece of candy\nLet me unwrap that and taste that\nJust give me what you can\u2019t get back\n\n[Verse 2 - Prodigy]\n\nHey, sunshine, we both had a wonderful time\nBut you ain\u2019t gotta stress, I see you when I\u2019m back on the side\nMy friend\u2019s got your girlfriends number\nWe keep in touch, love\nHey, don\u2019t you hate it when girl loves?\nShe\u2019s wanna be - more hugs and kisses?\nI ain\u2019t with it\nI like a chick. When she only wants to did it\nShe get it\nThen I say \u2026\n\u2026\nWe like \u2018em thick\nWe only love \u2018em when they comin out they outfit, (?)\nAnd love \u2018em most when they swallow\u2026\nP that type that have a lady-cop take off a gun-belt\nWork magic with a female\nIt\u2019s only real, I\u2019ll be fail\nIt\u2019s hard not to\nCold hearted down\u2019s got to\nMelt down and show me proper\nCause when I speak it\u2019s like pimp\nWhen he built a stable\nAnd when I boom boom I tranq them I turn them straight thun and leave them ... like how the earth's supposed to do P play the sun and how you heat it when I make moves\nCause I never sleep with it\nI\u2019m not your hubby\nFuck around\nClose my eyes and wake up \u2013 with no money\nBaby mothers keep throwing numbers at me\nTold me to page her\nI told them I call\n\u2026\nShe used to say \u201cinfamous\u201d\nWas her man\u2019s favorite CD\nHer daughter\u2019s dad driving everywhere \u2013 bumping on me\nEvery third day on week\nI knock his lady down to sleep\nClimax it, sneaking out the room listening\nIt ain\u2019t my fault\nTake your pain out on your man\nI\u2019m only being myself"

   "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nWhen I'm pissed off I listen to Mobb Deep\nMy pain goes away, my tension is released\nCause P understands me and Havoc knows best\nThey tellin my whole life with that shit they said\nWhen my lady start beefin I turn em up louder to drown out the sound of her voice\nOh you hear the sounds of the infamous Empire State Boys\nI vicariously live thru they story\nYou, say I'm a Stan but I beg to differ\nI'm just a real nigga, recognize real when I\nSee it or hear it, it's very distinctive\nYou can't make this shit up, you can't fake it\nSo instead of killin somebody I just sing along\nMake me wanna go catch a body but then I get calm\nCause Prodigy said to make love not war\nSo even though the music is murder I stay on\nMy peaceful shit, just leave me alone I feel like a teenager in my room, danger zone\nJust give me a little space and let me cool off with my favorite collection of songs\n\n(Verse 2)\nWhen life gets hard I listen to the Mobb\nSo even if I'm broke I still got songs\nTo fix my emotions and get my mind right\nSo if things go left I'mma be alright\nEven on my deathbed\nThe last thing I wanna hear before I sign out Is that Queen shit, I've got 99 problems but my music ain't one\nLook I can't find a job and my bitch cheatin son\nI can't afford a whip so I ride the train\nWith my headphones on, in another world man\nHavoc said I could shit on the world\nOnce I start 4 wheelin I'mma find another girl\nThat's why I pay attention to the lyrics cause everything they say is all realist\nWhen niggas argue about the best rap groups I'll be damn near, ready to fight for my dudes\nFuck top 5, my niggas top 3 Mobb Deep last longer than tomorrow, you'll see\nEverybody else just a bunch of wannabes\nThey wanna be like Hav and be like P\n\n(Verse 3)\nWhenever I feel like I just wanna quit I vibe with the most infamous there is\nCause these other dudes soft, I can't relate\nMobb Deep is my proverbial therapy\nThey the voice of the ghetto\nThese other rappers only speak for the corporate world\nThat's why they can't get no, Space in my mp3\nIt's no room for the garbage they tryna sell me\nDom Perignon, P bars, get me hype and remind me that I could do whatever in life\nDifferent people find motivation in different things\nWhen I was locked up it was HNIC he\nGave me the strength to make it out alive\nSo when P got locked up you know I had to strive\nJust to show my respect to the man that raised me\nWith music thats one of a kind and trailblazing\nHe wrote me back, I almost passed out\nSee I knew he was down to earth, I never had doubts\nYour punch lines and metaphors is cool\nBut when it come to just being dope Mobb Deep rule"

   "lyrics": "Correction officers were corrupt as shit. There was a whole prostitution ring happening in the prison. I guess you could say the inmates were the pimps and the COs were the hookers. A lot of the inmates in there \u2013 they got game. They\u2019re from the hood, they\u2019ll be talking that shit and the girls that work there, they\u2019re from the hood too (most of them). So they\u2019ll be feeling the inmates.\n\nNot all of them were into prostitution. Some would just have sex with the inmates for free. But the ones who were down to prostitute had a whole system to it. The way they got paid was the inmates would have their family send money through Western Union. Then the inmates would pay the COs and they\u2019d get busy in there. And they\u2019ll be having sex everywhere in the jail, in all kinds of places. It\u2019s a power thing though for the inmates, especially when you feel like you have no power in prison.\n\nIf you find one of them female prison guards who was down to fuck, you could get whatever you want from her after that. \u2018Cause they\u2019ll sneak all kinds of stuff over to you then: extra food, cigarettes, whatever. At least until they got caught.\n\nWhen I was in there, somebody had just gotten locked up. One of the officers got locked up for having sex with an inmate in the shower, and the reason they got caught is because some other inmate snitched. Fucked up, right?\n\nI had a favorite CO, but I ain\u2019t fuck her. Her name was Officer Butz. Imagine that? Butz. And her ass was real nice too. She was cute. As far as I knew, Butz wasn\u2019t about sex with inmates, especially not for money. She was good people. But she was a little flirt and shit. She would call me in the bubble and show me pictures on her phone of her and her girls at the beach in bikinis. I was like okay nice, Butz.\n\nOne night Butz called me out to the bubble. It\u2019s a bulletproof glass bubble, where the CO sits. And then outside of that is a hallway, and then it\u2019s two dorms on each side of the hall. So the CO is never in the dorm, and we\u2019d be in there dolo. So when you need help, the CO is way out there. Rikers Island is dangerous because of that alone.\n\nOne night after chow, Butz called me out to the bubble over the microphone. I come out, and she buzzed the door to the bubble. I walk to the open doorway, and she\u2019s like, \u201cCome inside.\u201d She reaches in her pocket and I\u2019m like, What the fuck?\u201d In there, she had two pieces of fried chicken wrapped in brown paper towels from the bathroom. She was like, \u201cHere, eat up boy.\u201d\n\nI only had one piece of chicken from chow that night, everybody always only got one piece. They\u2019d put it in the little window for you and walk away. So here come Butz with two more pieces. I was like, \u201cOh shit, good looking.\u201d Word. She hooked me up.\n\nI should\u2019ve fucked her for that alone because I was hungry as hell. I didn\u2019t, though. Pussy wasn\u2019t worth stretching my sentence or getting Butz in trouble. So I ate the two pieces of chicken and walked out.\nFrom commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook published by Infamous Books.\n\nYou can download the audio version of commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook for free on Amazon"

You will find out getting in my way\nBut for those who agree, please celebrate with us, as we proceed to succeed\n\nI take non- believers and change they whole view\nThey spend a little time, they singing a new tune\nI get it forever, P foreverly fresh\nName a rapper more sinister than Perignon is\nI pop pain, AK's, and currency bands\nMy skid mark's on fire I peel off so fast\nThis is deeper than rap, Infamous is a brand- a lifestyle, not a movement\nOur bullets go 'blam'\nLook I'm a seasoned vet marinaded in the trash on corners of the slum- dirty New York\nI am with the cleanest swag, and the meanest V\nIf your want the Feds want then I'm what the Feds need\n\nThese are new age rules, new age moves\nOnly thing I can't fuck with is these new age dudes\nBut it's the world and the people that I'm subject to\nI get this digital money and stay inside of my groove\nMaking new age rules, new age moves\nOnly thing I can't fuck with these new age dudes\nBut it's the world and the people that I'm subject to\nI get this digital money and stay inside of my groove\n\nAs a kid they used to call me 'little big time'\nThat was then, and this now\nNow they call me 'King Rhyme'\nGlobally I stand, Infamous to eternity\nI infinitely do this shit\nI cut that fucking tat off your head if you ever cross me\n\nNiggas screaming mutiny?\nI toss niggas off to the sharks\nH.N.I.C. 3- Redemption songs\nThis is how God intended it\nRed Carpet shit, Black ties and new black dresses\nDon't let the camera flash blind you\nR.S.V.P. all grown up now\nThere is no excuse\nNothing can stop the power of God\nThis is God's plan\nThis is the way God intended it"

Same ol' shit\nNo doubt, ain't nothing new\nLet's take a little spin, dun, word up\nYo, open my wings to a new day spread my lungs\nGet laced, jump in the whip, stash the guns\nTwist the key, shifted to D then flee\nBefore anything, get the daily dose of choke\nWe got the Benzo flooded with smoke on the float\nMy eye's burnin' from the dope killin' my throat\nLean my seat a taste, lumbar support on the belt\nDoin' 90 or more debatin' on the latest rhyme wars\nWhere units don't count\nBut your rap pay add up to large amounts\nGet my thrills puttin' other nigga's skills to sleep\nCatch chills off a infamous beats\nSwing the trees doin' one-handed u'ees\nBlowin' on the ouwee 'cause we can't have the medicine canoein'\nThere go the boys to the right, no days and nights like that\nAyyo, dun, hold that down and turn it around\nDirty as fuck, thugs drugs and guns, D's and fatigues\nT N T hopin' out of MPV's, surprise all a fuck out of me\nGot rubber Glocks pointed at me\nAyyo Twin, what the fuck?\nThey had us laid out on the ground holdin' us down\nWith gats to back of our heads was goin' down\nIt wasn't us that held up that bitch you got\nWhere's the proof, man? Let me speak to my attorney\nI know the routine, don't try to throw me\nI been gettin' knocked since 12 and my moms tried to scold me\nBut all that told me to get in more shit\nAyyo P, what up? You my co-D, we both get knocked\nWhat you did with that half a tree?\n(Right in my sock)\nYo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot\nDun, you know how I get down?\nYo I'm ready to bounce\nDo the 100 yard-dash and tear ass\nIf my other half was alive we woulda got kill\n'Cause dun woulda went for the guns and got ill\nPlus I gots cracks on me, they found the cracks on me\nLooked at'em, gave'em back to me\nI could swore they was takin' us in\nThen the lady in the car said, \"that's not them\"\nPicked us up, told me I could keep the drugs\nThey didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns\nAnd you ain't gotta tell us twice\nWe hopped in the car and slid off\nOn our way up-town for more of that funk\nP lit the tree back up\nGot off the Tri-burrough, hit the Henry Huds\nFuck it, let's slide through the Rutgers\nRoll the windows down 'cause infamous Mobb bumpers\nSkip To My Lou had the crowd jumpin'\nTook a walk through the park frontin'\nDidn't even have to hurt nuttin'\nMan, I love it, ain't nothin' like summer in New York\nHear Infamous Thoughts\nThen the Dream Team music starts\nDamn, we young black entrepreneurs\nNew York pricks and dicks can't stop our floss\nWe like organized crime, the fuckin' Mobb\nI'm only twenty-six playin' wit' serious cards\nDead serious cash, luxurious labs\nLearn to balance fame with pain, you can't complain\nJus' another day livin' in the hood\nJus' another day around the way\nFeelin' good today, oh no, we can't complain\nJus' another day livin' in New York\nDealin' with the jakes and the snakes \nFeelin' good today, we hit 'em up 'cause we here to stay"

Listen\nThese other rappers all rapping trickey\nToying with me boy I get silly\nLike big bags of dust and cocaine blunts\nWhite e & j and sprite you mix it up\nThis quality hood shit\nYeah all punk and garbage\nAnd people buying that bullshit\nOh my God it's a helluva drought\nOf fine time to rhyme\nPull your hardrives out and dig through the archive\nMaybe you can find an old dusty hot one\nCuz that new shit you got is not wassup\n[Chrous]\nWho you bullshittin?\nYou ain't top five\nWho you tryin' to goose up?\nYou ain't hot slime\nYou just a cold pussy\nYou just a coulda, shoulda, woulda ass nigga\nYou ain't never be alive nigga\n\n[Chorus X2]\n\n[Havoc]\nI'm as alive as they come with the eletrical tape\nCouldn't stop this fire when the wire break\nI annihiliate, violate somethin' phishies\nNutricious, eat food have my goons doing dishes ?\nAm I too specific?\nI beg to differ\nHand on the bible swear to be a better nigga\nWhateva\nThe first one got a nigga hypcriting\nFirst sign of border less spittin ?\nWho you gettin'\nYa whole team pussy\nA whole bunch of dead kittens\nHeads missing\nYa know it's serious when the feds phishing\nThey not gonna find nothin' in the shark tank\nNothin but algae and live bait\nClareece couldn't figure out my mind state\nYou wanted me death sent on a blind date\nThe unforgettable look that eyes make\nI see it in my dreams and when I awake\n\n[Chrous X2]\n\n[Prodigy]\nYeah that's how my shit spray\nWhen I'm spittin' these bars get the fuck out da way\nOr you gonna be a target to my 16 slabs\nI don't do battles\nI engage combat\nWithin the streets not in da street\nPut the coins on your eyes\nBefore the defeat\nSince you first heard of us\nYou wanted to be just like me\nHands on your neck tatted just like P\nLong chain swinging\nDingaling ringing mad bells in the salon I got dem singing\nMy praise is the craze\nIt's dem Queensbridge dogs\nNobody make music like dis anymore\nIt's just a bunch of reckless raps that makes no sense\nA hunnid bodies on your song\nYeah real intelligent\nYou's a writer of fiction\nStraight novelist\nSo many keys you woulda thought you was a locksmith\n\n[Chorus X2]"
