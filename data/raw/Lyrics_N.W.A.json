  "plain": "Eazy-E, Dr.\u00a0Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, DJ Yella, and Arabian Prince initially formed the collective known as \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous group,\u201d N.W.A.\u2014Niggaz With Attitudes.\n\nFollowing Ice Cube\u2019s stint in C.I.A. and Dre and Yella\u2019s departure from the World Class Wreckin Cru, they got together with Compton hustler Eric \u201cEazy-E\u201d Wright, who formed Ruthless Records and released Eazy\u2019s single \u201cBoyz n the Hood,\u201d written by Cube and produced by Dre. A compilation entitled N.W.A. and the Posse was released in 1987 but the group\u2019s seminal debut, Straight Outta Compton, was released on August 8, 1988. It led to the rise of gangsta rap and West Coast hip-hop in general with their tales of \u201creality rap\u201d from the streets of Compton and South Central Los Angeles. Their song \u201cFuck tha Police\u201d even put the group on the hit list of the FBI.\n\nArabian Prince was the first to leave the group in 1988 over a financial dispute. Ice Cube left N.W.A. in 1989 after his own financial dispute, leading to the other members to diss him on their subsequent releases: the 1990 EP 100 Miles and Runnin' and EFIL4ZAGGIN, which was released in 1991 and peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The D.O.C., who contributed to Straight Outta Compton and was still recovering from a car accident that severly altered his strong voice, wrote more rhymes for Dr. Dre and Eazy-E on the EFIL4ZAGGIN album in attempt to fill the void left by Cube.\n\nFollowing N.W.A.\u2019s jabs, Ice Cube threw the knockout blow to the group with his track \u201cNo Vaseline,\u201d which, in part, led to Dr. Dre leaving N.W.A. and Ruthless Records with his own financial dispute similar to Cube\u2019s two years earlier. Dre and The D.O.C. went on to establish Death Row Records with Suge Knight in 1992, where Dre would innovate the G-Funk sound and further establish the success of the West Coast sound in hip-hop.\n\nAfter back-and-forth disses between Dr. Dre and Eazy-E, plans for an N.W.A. reunion were in the discussion stages when Eazy-E died of AIDS in 1995. Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and MC Ren have since reunited to record the tracks \u201cChin Check\u201d and \u201cHello.\u201d In 2015, a biographical drama titled Straight Outta Compton was released to critical acclaim and a box office gross of over $200 million worldwide. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016."

(Move, motherfucker, move now!)\nWhat the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?\nJust shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)\nBut I didn't do shit\nMan, just shut the fuck up!\nEazy-E, won't you step up to the stand\nAnd tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]\nI'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'\nSweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and\nShining the light in my face, and for what?\nMaybe it's because I kick so much butt\nI kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast\nOn a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger\nOf an Uzi or an AK\n'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say\nThey put out my picture with silence\n'Cause my identity by itself causes violence\nThe E with the criminal behavior\nYeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor\nWithout a gun and a badge, what do you got?\nA sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot\nBy me or another nigga\nAnd with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger\n(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)\nAnd as you all know, E's here to rule\nWhenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror\nAnd ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a\nDumb motherfucker with a gun\nAnd if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one\nThat I take out, and then get away\nWhile I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say\n\n[Chorus]\nFuck the police, fuck the\u2014 fuck the\u2014\nFuck the police, fuck\u2014\nFuck the police, fuck\u2014 fuck\u2014\nFuck the police (The verdict)\n\n[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]\nThe jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker\nWait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!\nGet him out of here! (I want justice!)\nGet him the fuck out my face! (I want justice!)\nOut, right now!\nFuck you, you black motherfuckers!\n\n[Chorus]\nFuck the police\nFuck the police\nFuck the police"

(Whassup?)\nTell 'em where you from!\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nStraight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga\nMore punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger\nI'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this\nBut the pussy-ass niggas won't show this\nBut I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps\nIf not from the records, from jacking or craps\nJust like burglary, the definition is jacking\nAnd when I'm legally armed it's called packing\nShoot a motherfucker in a minute\nI find a good piece of pussy and go up in it\nSo if you're at a show in the front row\nI'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho\nYou'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to\nBut that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to\nA crazy motherfucker from the street\nAttitude legit, \u2018cause I'm tearing up shit\nMC Ren controls the automatic\nFor any dumb motherfucker that starts static\nNot the right hand, \u2018cause I'm the hand itself\nEvery time I pull an AK off the shelf\nThe security is maximum, and that's a law\nR-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw\nSee, \u2018cause I'm the motherfucking villain\nThe definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'\nThat's taking place without a clue\nAnd once you're on the scope, your ass is through\nLook, you might take it as a trip\nBut a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip\nStraight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\n\n[Interlude: Dr. Dre]\nEazy is his name, and the boy is coming\u2026\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy E]\nStraight outta Compton\nIs a brother that'll smother your mother\nAnd make your sister think I love her\nDangerous motherfucker raising hell\nAnd if I ever get caught, I make bail\nSee, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem\nI see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him\nBut I'm smart, lay low, creep a while\nAnd when I see a punk pass, I smile\nTo me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving\nBut don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling\nLooking for the one they call Eazy\nBut here's a flash, they'll never seize me\nRuthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload\nYou see a spark and jump over hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration\nFeel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgetting\nSo what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!\nYou think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker\nThis is an autobiography of the E\nAnd if you ever fuck with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother\nWord to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\n\n[Outro]\nDamn, that shit was dope!"

(Express yourself)\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]\nI'm expressing with my full capabilities\nAnd now I'm living in correctional facilities\nCause some don't agree with how I do this\nI get straight, meditate like a Buddhist\nI'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary\nBut my technique is very necessary\nBlame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predicate\nAdd it on a dope beat and that'll make you think\nSome suckers just tickle me pink\nTo my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one\nYou know what? I won't hesitate to dis one\nOr two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this\nSome drop science, well I'm dropping English\nEven if Yella makes it a cappella\nI still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess\nCause it's known to give a brother brain damage\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing\nBut making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel\n\n[Chorus]\nExpress yourself (Ah, ah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah)\nExpress yourself (Smoke, smoke)\nCome on and do it (Yeah, kick it over here)\nExpress yourself (Do it, do it, [?])\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nNow, getting back to the PG\nThat's program, and it's easy\nDre is back, new jacks are made hollow\nExpressing ain't their subject because they like to follow\nThe words, the style, the trend, the records I spin\nAgain and again and again, yo, you on the other end\nWatch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help\nThere's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself\nIt's crazy to see people be\nWhat society wants them to be, but not me\nRuthless is the way to go, they know\nOthers say rhymes that fail to be original\nOr they kill where the hip-hop starts\nForget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts\nSome musicians cuss at home\nBut scared to use profanity when up on the microphone\nYeah, they want reality but you won't hear none\nThey rather exaggerate a little fiction\nSome say no to drugs and take a stand\nBut after the show they go looking for the dopeman\nOr they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say \"Hell no!\"\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...\n\n[Chorus]\nExpress yourself (Yeah, yeah, yeah, [?])\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it (Yeah, yeah, do it)\nExpress yourself (Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre [?] and N.W.A)\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\nExpress yourself\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]\nFrom the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart\nThen expression is a big part of it\nYou ain't efficient when you flow\nYou ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis\nThere's a little bit more to show\nI got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo\nOr a lesson, all of 'em expression\nAnd if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you\nI might ignore your record because it has no bottom\nI get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn\nIt's Dre on the mic, getting physical\nDoing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob\nYes, I'm macabre but you know you need this\nAnd the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus\nOr a tumor but here's the rumor\nDre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good\nWhen I start expressing myself, Yella slam it\nCause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage\nOr I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket\nI got knowledge and other suckers lack it\nSo, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic\nAsk what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight\nCause if I strike, it ain't for your good health\nBut I won't strike if you just\n\n[Outro]\nExpress yourself (Yeah, yeah, this record's almost over, almost over, gotta get hyped up)\nExpress yourself (Do it, do it)\nCome on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)\nExpress yourself (Compton's full of fakes, Compton's full of fakes, yeah)\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it (That's what she said, what she said)\nCome on and do it\nCome on and do it"

I think a bitch is a bitch\n\n[Bitch]\nWho the fuck you think you calling a bitch you little sorry motherfucker\nI don't know who the fuck you think you talking to\nLet me tell you one motherfucking thing, I'm not no-\n\"Bitch, shut the fuck up\"\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nYo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money (how?)\nShe look good and the bitch walk funny (he ain't lying)\nShe ain't no dummy, she's rather conniving\nYo bitch, fuck what I'm driving (yup)\nSee a young nigga that's striving (like me)\nYou're through without a BMW\nThat's why a bitch is a bitch I guess\nOr either P-M-S\nHere, test the girl that's kinda snobby (alright)\nAnd I bet you dissing niggas is her hobby\nAnd after she finished the test\nGrade today of B-I-T-C-H\nAnd watch her get mad 'cause she know it's true (she know it)\nBut a nigga like me'll say \"fuck you\" *laughs*\nDo like Ice Cube, slam her ass in a ditch (word) (slam her ass)\n'Cause a bitch is a bitch\n\n[Bitch/Ice Cube]\n\"Why I gotta be a bitch?\"\nI ain't call you no bitch, if you listen to the goddamn song it'd tell you what a bitch is...\n\"Fuck the song 'cause I'm not no motherfucking bitch\"\nI didn't say you was a bitch, if you stop acting like a goddamn bitch\n\"Fuck you, little punk-ass little nigga\"\nFuck you, bitch! You sloppy-ass, scandalous-ass ho!\n\"Fuck you! Who the fuck you think you are?\"\nFuck you! Suck my dick, bitch! You scandalous-ass, doo-doo dog breath, stinking, ugly...\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nI once knew a bitch who got slapped\n'Cause she played me like she was all that\nA bitch can be your best friend talking behind your back (yeah?)\nAbout who's fucking who and who's getting fat\nLook at yourself for me (look, bitch)\nNow do you fall in this category?\nOr you the kind that won't blink\n'Cause you don't think your shit stink *laughs*\nLucky I haven't had a drink\n'Cause I'd down your ass\nThen I'd clown your ass\n'Cause the niggas I hang with ain't rich\nWe'll all say \"Fuck you bitch!\" (word)\nNow what can I do with a ho like you\nBend your ass over and then I'm through (get the fuck out)\n'Cause you see Ice Cube ain't taking no shit\n(Why?) 'Cause I think a bitch is a bitch\n\n[Narrator]\nThere you have it, the description of a bitch\nNow ask yourself are they talking about you?\nAre you that funky, dirty, money-hungry, scandalous, stuck-up, hair piece contact wearing bitch?\nYep, you probably are\n\nBitch!"

everywhere man\nNon-reality seein', non-reality feelin'\nNon-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man\nHey, I don\u2019t know, reality, it\u2019s important to me, man\nSo fellas man, tell these niggas what it\u2019s like in the minds of real niggas\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nPrisoner like a hostage\nYo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich\nDeep in the dirt cause you's a sucker\nAnd you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker\nDon\u2019t try to hang, you best avoid\nCause my foot will be so far up your ass you\u2019ll get hemorrhoids\nBefore you try to fuck wit Ren\nI'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nFirst come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve\nStep up and get what you deserve\nFrom the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac\nBrainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back\nNow how the fuck you think a rap will last?\nWit your ass saying shit that is said in the past\nYo, be original, your shit is sloppy\nGet off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy\n\n[Verse 3: MC Ren]\nFalling deep in the drums so many of styles\nIs one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles\nCheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating\nBut weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\nCause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full\nThey got the nerve to cuss\nOnly reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us\n\n[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]\nYo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do\nYou don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you\nYou can't harm me, alarm me\nCause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army\nThe niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know\nWe blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo\nTry us and take it\nYo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas\n\n[Verse 5: MC Ren]\nYou can run, but you can\u2019t hide, you know I'mma find'cha\nCause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha\nDon\u2019t look back because you\u2019re shaking and all scared\nA nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare\nSo sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on\nDon't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on\nDon\u2019t say it\u2019s psycho and then you just might go\nMentally fucked up when I let the right blow\n\n[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]\nAll these niggas wit the jibber jabber\nBut couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer\nGangstas in black are out there\nBut only because, yo, it\u2019s the shit that we wear\nOn my muthafucking dick\nBut I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick\nSo, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead\nYou get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead\n\n[Verse 7: Eazy-E +  MC Ren ]\nBlack, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see\nA little streetwise nigga, you know me\nRolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps\nBut you muthafuckas know who run the streets\nWit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit\nNow how much harder can another nigga get?\nTrying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please\nSince you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees\nCause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill\nEazy-E, a nigga that's real\n\n[Interlude: DJ Yella]\nReal niggas, straight off the streets of Compton\nQuick to get in your shit without second thought\nAnd if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught\nSo if you're talking shit about the niggas in black\nBow down to the Kings in Raider hats\n\n[Verse 8: MC Ren]\nThey played out, that's what niggas were chanting\nOne nigga left and they said we ain't happening\nPeople had thought we was finished and then done wit\nBut if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit\nYet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears\nAnd quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas\nAnd when the new record comes, I\u2019ll come like a fucking bomb\nAsking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb\nYou're on the dicks of four niggas not one\nAnd when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one\nSo brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up\nCause if I let you slide, it\u2019s just cause you lucked up\nDon\u2019t come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya\nAnd if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya\nBecause my attitude's a little bigga\nCause MC Ren is one of the real niggas\n\n[Verse 9: Dr. Dre]\nLost in a muthafucking world of madness\nSadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad there's\nSucka muthafuckas like you, making wack jams\nBecause it only shows you how dope I am\nNever try to ignore us\nWhen I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis\nCause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure\nYou can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger\nDre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that\u2019s smart\nA nigga that\u2019s paid to say what others are scared to play\nWe started out wit too much cargo\nSo I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold\nYo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say\nBut I'm a do the shit anyway\nCause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in\n\n[Outro: MC Ren]\nN.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990's\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E\nAnd I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: FBI + MC Ren]\nCatch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them\nHey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up\nYou don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?\nWe haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nA 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and\nYou want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in\nSince I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -\nIs one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck\nChances are usually not good\n'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood\nAnd gettin' jacked by the you-know-who\nWhen in a black and white the capacity is two\nWe're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers\nNot wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers\nThey're out to take our heads for what we said in the past\nPoint blank, they can kiss my black ass\nI didn't stutter when I said \"Fuck Tha Police\"\n'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace\nNow it's broken and can't be fixed\n'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so\nNow I'm creepin' through the fall\nRunnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all\nSo for now pack the gun and\nHold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'\n\n[Interlude]\nIn today's news. Four fugitives are on the run\nFBI sources tell us that the four are headed\n100 miles to their home base, Compton\n\n[Break: Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]\nLend me a mutherfuckin' ear\nSo I can tell you why\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nRunnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase\nWith a steady pace on the face that just reads race\nThe road ahead goes on and on\nThe shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon\nRunnin' on but never runnin' out\nStayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out\nHitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do\nBut nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude\nConfused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose\nOne of the few who's been accused and abused\nOf the crime of poisonin' young minds\nBut you don't know shit til you been in my shoes\nAnd Dre is back from the C-P-T\nDroppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E\nSo fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!\nAnd any mutherfucker that disagrees\nStuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass\n'Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past\nMy mind was slick - my temper was too quick\nNow the FBI's all over my dick\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E]\nGot the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock\nThat's when the E jumped off the startin' block\nA 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch\nA little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch\nYeah, back to Compton again\nYo, it's either that or the Federal pen\n'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time\nTakin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind\nRunnin' like I just don't care\nCompton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there\nArchin' my back and on a straight route\nJust like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out\nFrom city to city I'm a menace as I pass by\nRippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm\nA straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'\nStraight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'\n\n[Interlude]\nThis one goes out to the four brothers from Compton\nYou're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:\nNowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide\nGood luck brothers\n\n[Verse 4: MC Ren]\nRunnin' like a nigga I hate to lose\nShow me on the news but I hate to be abused\nI know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up\nEven if the FBI wants me to shut up\nBut I've got 10 000 niggas strong\nThey got everybody singin' my \"Fuck Tha Police\" song\nAnd while they treat my group like dirt\nTheir whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts\nSo I'mma run 'til I can't run no more\n'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score\nI got a urge to kick down doors\nAt my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls\n\n[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]\nClouds are dark and brothers are hidin'\nDick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'\nStarted with five and, yo, one couldn't take it\nSo now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it\nThe number's even - now I'm leavin'\nWe're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in\nHer and the troops are right behind me\nBut they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me\n\n[Verse 6: Eazy-E]\nOne more mile to go through the dark streets\nRunnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet\nBut you know I never stumble or lag last\nI'm almost home so I better haul ass\nTearin' up everything in sight\nIt's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight\nNow that chase, the shit, is done and\nFour mutherfuckers goin' crazy with\nA 100 miles of runnin'!\n\nStop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Surprise, niggas!"

I wish I was in the bucket\nTo be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it\nSo I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar\nAnd got the fuck out the car\nWent to the bucket and I looked through the window\nIt was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo\nAnd my turn was like next\nI couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest\nI wanted to see the face, I felt I oughta\nPeep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!\nAnd she's only 14 and a ho'\nBut the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro\nShe looked at me, I was surprised\nBut wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized\nI told the bitch to do it quick\nYou little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n(What do you want me to do with it?)\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n(\"She swallowed it\")\nYeah (Get it all baby)\n\n[Verse 3: MC Ren]\nNow I'm a break it down with a fact\nSince the last \"Just don't bite it\" girls don't know how to act\nSayin' that they never would suck a dick\nBut when they've tried it they couldn't quit\nCuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit\nAnd those are the main ones that say they don't do it\nBut MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it\nSo fellas, next time they try to tell a lie\nThat they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye\nAnd then the ho' will fall to the ground\nThen you'll open up her mouth\nPut your dick in and move the shit around\nAnd she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own\nActin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone\nAnd then she won't let go\nBecause bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano\nGet the last drop, unclogging the pipe\nThen the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night\nBecause she just can't quit\nCuz she's addicted, addicted\nShe's addicted, addicted\nShe's addicted to suck a good dick\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n(What do you want me to do with it?)\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n(\"She swallowed it\")\nYeah (Get it all baby)\n\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n(What do you want me to do with it?)\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n(\"She swallowed it\")\nYeah (Get it all baby)"

Because so many are relatin' to this\nJealous is how they feel it intentionally\nBut they start to love it because I made it eventually\nPumpin' the music I keep the music like pumpin'\nCause Ren ain't in here for nothin', I keep the average crowd jumpin'\nYo, you know the color, the villain's in black\nAlways down to make noise, and attack\nSo you better get back unless you wanna come with it\nAnd make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it\nYou're screamin' with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin'\nYou're wakin up in a sweat cause Ren is givin' bad dreams and\nI'm not schemin', I'm just tellin the facts\nThat's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack\nSo brothers that wanna scrap with me\nThat sweezin' and sneezin' will have to lap with me\nEspecially beggin' to write some lyrics with me\nI just snatch your girl to take a nap with me\nCause when it comes to Ren there's no comparison\nAnd if you try to be me, it's quite embarrassin'\nBut I understand cause you're mentally slow\nCause I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\nThe gangsta's black and he's about to attack\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\nLemme bust a freestyle there - (Alright bet)\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nI can tell that you're afraid to fight me\nSimple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me\nBecause your sweat is a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat\nI'm a threat, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck\nAnd clean the dirt off your face that causes acne\nIt's ridiculous thinkin' that you can jack me\nThis is the round where the punch will go\nInto your H-E-A-D; that's known as a blow\nI'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin\nLike, see, I'm hatin' the fakin' I keep the suckers like shakin'\nScared to speak with a thought when they're chosen\nThe sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen\nThis is a battle to the death, it's like the same ol'\nAgainst a brother on a tip, with a Kangol\nGivin' a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin\nBut I'm comparin' and tearin' em but I'm makin a livin'\nWith the hype of a nine volt battery\nAnd the odds for me to conquer is averagely good\nMeanin' I'mma flow\nI'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nThe gangsta's black and he's about to attack\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\nMan whatcha gonna do now? - *Get funky*\n\n[Verse 3: MC Ren]\nThe 'do not disturb' sign is in effect\nWhile I'm thinkin of a fool to select\nTo give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim\nSlammin' my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them\nTell 'em they're guilty, and peep out the bailer\nAnd get a new track o' drums so I can play with\nPercussion, pumpin' it loud when I perform\nYo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform\nIt ain't a rule in the book you have to go by\nHey, cause when it comes to cheatin', yo, you should know I\nFor fear in the hearts cause it's the hearts full of fear\nCoz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear\nThe Hulk was incredible yo but Ren he was super\nBut now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper\nBut a soldier with a top rankin\nGivin' dope material, the hell with the gankin'\nSo play like an airplane and just jet\nAnd keep your blood pressure low cause I'm a threat, if not\nI'm afraid of the show\nThat you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nThe gangsta's black and he's about to attack\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nThe gangsta's black\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\nThe gangsta's black and he's about to attack\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nThe gangsta's black\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\nThe gangsta's black and he's about to attack\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nThe gangsta's black\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me"

'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face\nI know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nSometimes I used to wonder\nHow the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number\nHe's getting juiced for his ducats\nI tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket\nAnd won't think nuttin' of it\nShe can ride or walk, either leave it or love it\nI show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say\nI'm a ruthless N-I double-G A\n'Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me\nYou know I spell girl with a B\nA brother like me is only out for one thing\nI think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no\nFlowers to your doorstep, when we goin' out\n'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt\nAnd after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing\nYou want lobster? Huh! I'm thinking Burger King\nAnd when I take you, you get frustrated\nYou can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it\nBut you see, I don't go nuts\nOver girls like you with the BIG ol butts\nIt start comin' out the pocket, to knock it\nBut when the damage is done\nYou can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl\nFor the simple fact that, I ain't the one\n\n[Interlude #2: Woman #2 and Woman #1]\nI don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none\nYeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive you money? Why bother?\n'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father\nGirl, I can't be played or ganked\nGanked means getting took for your bank\nOr your gold or your money or something\nNine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing\nThey get mad when I put it in perspective\nBut let's see if my knowledge is effective\nTo the brothas man they robbing you blind\n'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind\nKeep your money to yourself, homie\nAnd if you got enough game\nYou'll get her name and her number\nWithout going under\nYou can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em\nI used to get no play; now she stay behind me\n'Cause I said I had a Benz 190\nBut I lied and played the one\nJust to get some; now she feels dumb\nTo my homies it's funny\nBut that's what you get trying to play me for my money\nNow don't you feel used?\nBut I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots\nYou shouldn't be, so damn material\nAnd try to milk Ice Cube like cereal\nNow how many times do I have to say it?\n'Cause if I have to go get a gun\nYou girls will learn I don't burn\nYou think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one\n\n[Outro: Woman #1 and Ice Cube]\nBut you said you love me!\nI don't see no rings on this finger\nWhy you doin' me like this? I love you!\nYeah, you love my money; I got what I wanted -- beat it!"

What's goin' on?\nAy what ch'all gonna do for this last record?\nNah tell me what cha'all gonna do?\nOkay, you want me to do the intro? Aight!\n\n[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]\nParental discretion is advised for the moment\nWhile I'm getting candid, now understand it\nAin't too typical in any way, though the pro\nOn the mic is the D.O. to the C., this is an intro\nI know The D.O.C. makes you want to take a Valium\nSo buy a bucket cause upcoming is my album\nAnd for the record, meaning my record, check it\nListen to the single and you'll be like, yo, I gotta get it\nBut in the meantime, listen to the rhyme\nOf the Dr. Dre played with N.W.A\nYella's on the drum roll, rocking the beat\nAiyyo Dre, where's you gonna take this shit man?\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nAiyyo, let's take it to the street (WORD UP!)\nLet 'em understand perfection\nLet knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing\nCause I don't give a fuck about radio play\nObserve the English I display\nLyrics for the adults, children have been barred\nAnd scarred from listening to something so motherfucking hard\nDope, pumping that's so my shit will never falter\nYo it's Dre so fuck the \"Mind of Minolta\"\nPsycho like no other motherfucker\nSo step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O\nBut be warned, never will I leave like a regular\nCause I'm a little better than the regular competitor\nI use to see 'em on stage\nEarning money like a thief, but without a gauge\nUntil I got full, of clocking the lame getting pull\n(They said you wasn't gon' get paid)\nNah that's bullshit! They like it stylistic\nAnd I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic\n(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashing when I'm in action\nA photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion\nPure simplicity -- see, it's elementary\nYou hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century\nTry to comprise a word to the wise and the guys\nParental discretion is advised\n\n[Verse 3: MC Ren]\nRen is most extremely high performance\nThe black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous\nSome shit I don't take it, not even in a toilet\nAnd shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it\nTurn up the pilot as it burns\nAnd maybe the motherfuckers will learn\nI'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible\nNot considered a prince, cause I'm a principal\nI'm engineering the shit that you're hearing\nCause when it comes to power, I'm power steering\nSilly you say, I say you're silly when you say it\nRushing to the eject, to put my shit in and play it\nIt's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur\nAnd I'm not giving a fuck while I'm damaging ya\nIt's for the record; so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it\nAnd if there was a trophy involved, I'd win it\nPossession is mine and I'm the holder\nCause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck cause I'm older\nSo for you to step off would be wise\nAnd say fuck it, parental discretion is advised\n\n[Verse 4: Ice Cube]\nI be what is known as a bandit\nYou gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it\nCause if you fail to see, read it in Braille\nIt'll still be funky -- so what's next is the flex\nOf a genius, my rapid-stutter-stepping if you seen this\nDope, you hope that I don't really mean this\nBut if Play made a greater high-top fade\nIt's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark\nYou guess it was a test of a different style\nIt's just another motherfucker on the pile\nDriving your ass with the flow of the tongue\nYou hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung\nTo your attention, by the hardest motherfucking artist\nThat is known for lynching any sucker in a minute\nStagger 'em all\nWhen I start flowing like Niagara Falls\nIce Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle\nMove like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle\nI get low on the flow so let your kids know\nWhen I bust, parental discretion is a must\n\n[Verse 5: Eazy-E]\nLittle did they know that I would be arriving\nAnd it's surprising, rocking it from where I been\nBut it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made\nIn the trade where funky ass records are being played\nFuck the regular, yo as I get better the\nBitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick\nSo I get 'em hot, thinking they're gonna get it\nAs they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket\nTo you it may be funny, but\nThere's no service of beef without money\nSo slip the C-note, and you can choke\nOn a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat\nForeplay to me ain't shit\nWhen you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get the dick\nOf the Eaz, if you can deal with the size\nBut if you can't, parental discretion's advised!\n\n[Outro]\nShut the fuck up!"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nDr. Dre: Yo man there's alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality\nIce Cube: Yo Dre you've been doin all this dope producin', you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is\nDr. Dre: So watch do you want me to do\n\n[Entrence]\nAll you got to do now, express yourself\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]\nI'm expressin' with my full capabilities\nNow I'm livin' in correctional facilities\n'Cause some don't agree with how I do this\nI get straight, meditate, like a Buddhist\nI'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary\nBut my technique is very necessary\nBlame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predicate\nAdd it on a dope beat, and it'll make ya think\nSome suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach\n'Cause they don't flow like this one\nYou know what, I won't hesitate to dis one or two before I'm through\nSo don't try to sing this\nSome drop science, well I'm droppin' English\nEven if Yella, makes it a-capella\nI still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess\n'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'\nBut makin' a sucker and you equal\nDon't be another sequel\n\n[Hook]\nExpress yourself\nDo it good\nExpress yourself\nOh do it\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre + Ice Cube]\nIce Cube, is not for the pop charts\nSo where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself\nMy boy'll show you how\nYo Dre  - What up? - Drop English right about...\n....Now, gettin' back to the PG\nThat's program, and it's easy\nDre is back - New jacks are made hollow\nExpressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow the words\nThe style, the trend, the records I spin\nAgain and again and again\nYo ya on the other end\nWatch a brother playin' dope rhymes, with no help\nThere's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin myself\nIt's crazy to see people be what society wants 'em to be\nBut not me\nRuthless, is the way to go, they know\nOthers say rhymes that fail to be original\nOr they kill where the hip-hop starts\nForget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts\nAnd those musicians, curse at home\nBut scared to use profanity, when up on the microphone\nYeah they want reality, but you won't hear none\nThey rather exaggerate a little fiction\nSome say no to drugs, and take a stand\nBut after the show they go lookin for the dope man\nOh they ban my group from the radio\nHear N.W.A. and say ''Hell no!''\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth\nAs long as you make a note to\n(express yourself)\n\n[Hook]\nExpress yourself\nDo it do...\nExpress yourself\nOh do it!\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre + MC Ren]\nA lyricist, yo Dre is the name for it\nTo make somethin' dope on a record that's what he came for\nKickin' reality yo but staying hisself\nBut it's important to keep it in mind to (Express yourself)\nFrom the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then\nExpression is big part of it\nYou ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift\nMovin' like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis\nThere's a little bit more to show\nI got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo\nOr a lesson, all of them expression\nAnd if you start fessin', I got a Smith&Wesson for ya\nI might ignore your record, because it has no bottom\nI get loose in the Summer, Winter, Spring and Autumn\nIt's Dre on the mic gettin physical\nDoin' the job, NWA is the lynch mob\nYes I'm macabre, but you know you need this\nAnd the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus\nOr a tumor, but here's the rumour, Dre's in the neighborhood and he's up to no good\nWhen I start expressin myself, Yella slam it\n'Cause if I stay funky like this, I'm doin' damage\nOr I'mma be too hyped, I need a straight jacket\nI got knowledge, and other suckers lack it\nSo when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic\nAsk what it's like, it's like we gettin' hype tonight\n'Cause if I strike, It ain't for your good health\nBut I won't strike if you just\n(express yourself)\n\n[Hook]\nExpress Yourself\nDo it good...\nExpress Yourself\nOh do it"

First you grab the dick\nNext you gently lick it up and down, then insert it into the mouth\nTake it slow, don't rush it, and before you know it ..\nSPLASH!\n\n[Eazy-E]\nIt goes one for the treble, two for the bass\nShe got nut all over her face\nKick kick it ...\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nSlow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow\nAs I produce and illustrate you to a ho\nCaught on the late night, stamping on the base-pipe\nShe's a hype to get you on the late flight\nBut back in school she was a cutie, yo\nThen after graduation started giving up the booty\nIn school, stuck her head in a feather\nEvery time I asked her what's the time\nIt was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'\nI wanted a date, she wouldn't even be my friend\nBut now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me\nCause she's got a gang o' kidz nappy-heads and all dirty\nAnd she's getting pimped by a nigga that's thirty\nI saw her hanging in an alley\nRaggin to her friends how she's ho'in' in the valley\nAll by herself, doin' on the ho stroll\nComin back home late night with the bankroll\nYou know a bitch like that makes me sick\nBut I've heard that she sucks a good dick!\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nAt a high school dance, me and the niggas bailed in\nI saw her sittin' with her friends, with the clan\nSo sexy, thought she was all that\nShe wouldn't even look at us because we wore the black hat\nShe was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor\nBut an instant prostitute behind closed doors\nOn the streets she's a late night feature\nWalking home from school, I saw her sucking a nigga's dick under the bleachers\nShe saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face\nBut a bitch full of nut couldn't escape in the chase\nA disgrace, If I ever ever saw one\nThere wasn't a nigga on the block late at night not getting done\nSo she begged me not to tell a soul\nThen I said of course, cause my dick, yo, it's harder than a totem pole\nThen again it don't concern me\nCause there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me\nAnd then I might have to shoot the ho\nI mean checking with the quickness just to let her know\nBut to prevent from getting sick -\nI would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: MC Ren]\nNow I was at a club on a late late Sunday\nPeeping at the bitches 'till the next day Monday\nHad a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good\nAnd suddenly I saw this bitch  that lives in my neighborhood\nShe went to church every week so now I lucked up\nShe was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up\nBack at the house she was bitch n' be ignoring\nAnd when she start to talk the ho' was kinda boring\nYo, but now I got to dawn, see\nNow she's dancing on the floor with a skirt and no panties on\nShaking that ass like a salt shaker\nI already got my plans -\nJust while I'm a take her to a room\nBut yo I mean a rest room\nAnd stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom\nSo I grabbed her hand and she's wit(h) it\nSo when she turns sober, she'll never admit it\nSo while she's dropped I'd better get it quick\nAnd see for myself if she sucks a good dick!\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nIt's the world's biggest dick\nDon't matter just don't bite it\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"\nDon't matter just don't bite it\nShe swallowed it (yeah)\n\n[Outro]\n\"So there you have it - a job well done (She swallowed it)\nBut for now let me get back to what I was doing\" (She swallowed it)\nGet it\nWhat the fuck suck this dick bitch\nYeah, here comes\nOoh shit, goddamn\nGoddamn\nGet it all baby, get it all\nSuck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy baby\nSuck this dick\nYou know you like it\nSuck it\nOh she swallowed it\nShe swallowed, oh shit, get it all, get it all, suck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy ..\nWait till I tell the fellas how you sucked this dick\nHey matter of fact, I want you to suck Dre's dick\nThen I want you to suck Yella dick\nYou already sucked Ren's dick\nYOU BOYS ARE DISGUSTING!\nJust suck my dick bitch... cause I'm a nigga wit an attitude!"

We are born to die nigga\nYou've been dyin for 400 years\nNiggas know how to die\nNiggas don't know nothin else, but dying\nNiggas dream about dying\n\n[Bridge: MC Ren]\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]\nI got a case, of spittin in a motherfucker's face\nSo me and my ace, we got a taste\nOf a motherfucker's billy club, he took his gun and\nPut it to my head and said, \"Nigga start runnin\"\nSo tell me what's the next episode?\nIs he crazy, does he want to chase me or waste me?\nI thought, \"Run nigga run\", but I caught myself\nBecause my secondary thought was death\nI've got head and heart real, but still a motherfucker said\n\"I want another black motherfucker dead\nNiggas ain't good for shit to me\"\nCause it's a race for second class, so get your ass\nUp against the wall bitch, and then he tried\nTo jump me but the punk became a victim of a walkby\nFuckin with Dre, you get a foot up in your asshole\nIt's just another way to let you know\nNigga send them, nigga send them, nigga send them\nPunk can't fuck with me - Real motherfucking G\nStraight from the streets of the CPT\nTelling you why, real niggas don't die\n\n[Hook]\n\"I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!\"\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nReal niggas don't die cause they eventually multiply\nThe niggas I'm with, they take an eye for an eye\nBecause the times are so wrong, gotta stay so strong\nNiggas gotta keep it goin on and on\nAnd don't let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race\nHave your residence occupyin a jail space\nThat's what they want to do cause the system is fucked around\nI try to let you know with the records that's underground\nThey don't give a fuck about a nigga, they would rather pull the trigger\nAnd have you in front of a barrel smilin sayin \"Cheese!\"\nSo nigga get smart and rebel back\nI'm not with that black shit so I'm not gonna yell that\nAll I see is niggas getting harassed\nAnd can't do nothin about it but get a foot in they ass, yo\nBut if every nigga grabbed a nine\nAnd started shootin motherfuckers it would put 'em in line\nAnd that's how it's supposed to be\nWhen a pussy-ass nigga try to fuck with me\nYo, because it's useless to try\nTo kill a nigga cause nigga a motherfuckin real nigga don't die!\n\n[Hook]\n\"I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!\"\n\n[Interlude]\nDie nigga, everywhere you go\nNiggas dying, niggas been dyin for 400 years\n\n[Bridge: MC Ren]\nI'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E]\nOnly the good die young, so that makes me young and bad\nPuttin ass-kickings on the niggas that never had\nSo I guess that makes me tough shit\nStraight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuck with\nSo how can a nigga die, when he's causin the bloodshed\nBy shoot motherfuckers in the head\nTryin to make a nigga extinct because they fear me\nBut never wanna hear me\nSo I'mma let 'em know how a nigga's livin\nTakin from motherfuckers cause nobody ain't givin\nA damn thang! To a nigga, a real nigga\nSo I'm living by the motherfuckin trigger\nCause a nigga ain't afraid of bein locked up\nI'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuck?\nBut they still want to try\nTo kill a nigga like me but motherfuckin real niggas don't die!\n\n[Hook]\n\"I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!\"\n\n[Outro: MC Ren]\nYeah, a real nigga don't die!\nYeah motherfuckers!\n(\"Die, nigga!\")"

One less bitch I gotta worry about\nBut that ain't how it turned out..\n\n[Verse 4: MC Ren]\nYo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her\nStraight to the muthafuckin' trigger and said \"I got her!\"\nBut I had better plans to give her the blues\nLike dumpin' her in the river with cement shoes\nI knew my money was comin' up short\nAnd the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get caught\nCame home early and straight bust her ass\nOn the couch with her other nigga countin' my cash\nI should've known she was like them other hoes\nI told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes\nButt naked, nothin' left but the shoes\nI had up a nine so they couldn't refuse\nI shot the nigga, he was outta there\nAnd tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin' chair\nNow there's one less bitch I gotta worry about\nEverybody out, that's how it turns out\n\n[Hook: MC Ren]\nOne less\nOne less\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about!\n\n[Outro: Eazy-E]\nIn reality, a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies\nA nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches\nAnd all bitches are created equal\nTo me, all bitches are the same\nMoney-hungry, scandalous groupie hoes\nThat's always ridin' on a nigga's dick, always in a nigga's pocket\nAnd when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind\nTo me, ALL BITCHES AIN'T SHIT!\n\n[Hook: MC Ren]\nOne less\nOne less\nOne less bitch you gotta worry about!"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nEazy-E: Yo Ren\nMC Ren:  What up?\nEazy-E: Take one\nMC Ren: Yo\nEazy-E: Hit it\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nRuthless, plenty of that and much more\nSo at the party, Ren is controllin the floor\nThat you step and do your dance routine\nIt ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene\nWith a villain doin damage on a 24 track\nWith no confusion to finish my conclusion\nRythymatic rhymes from a radio cat\nYou can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back\nRuthless gangsta - Cold killin\nYou wanna know what it's means? - Definition villain\nWith the stupid dope rhyme\nSo once you hear one line you can tell it's mine\nWith a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin\nAnd a look that keeps you all starin\nAnd wondering why I'm invincible\nBut when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible\nI don't take no shorts while I'm constructing the ground\nThat makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound\nGirls drool on me like a diamond\n(Yo Ren, tell them what they do when you start rhymin)\nI go to the party, I hip, I hop the spot\nI dunno what it is, but the girls get hot\nPerspirin' like they're on fire and\nTheir so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin\nAnd for this reason I'm a walkin threat\nSo when I'm on stage I want quiet on tha set\n\n\"Light, camera, action\" (N.W.A. take two)\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nNow to get started with my musical profession\nA gangsta or villain in mine is in session\nThe way that I'm referrin' to this makes ya move ya butt\nBut don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up\nAnyway I keep em clappin' along\nCoz' nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong\nI'm like Toyota, who could ask for anything more\nWhen N.W.A. is cold rockin' the floor\nLike stupid, actin like a retard\nWaitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part\nIt tempts me so with temptation\nWritin' my lyrics with this hyped information\nThis is a section of my creation\nSo don't say shhh! with an exclamation\nJust look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines\n(Boy you should have known by now) It's mine!\nUnpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed\nIt's irresistable, meaning that you can't avoid\nAnd while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat\nBut after I rip it up I want quiet on tha' set\n\n\"Light, camera, action\" (N.W.A. take three)\n\n[Verse 3: MC Ren + Eazy-E]\nI can be loud as hell, think I will? Never\nQuiet on tha' set - Yeah I like that better\nCause what I can do I think I earn respect\nAnd if I didn't from you, that's what I expect\nCause if it ain't ruff it ain't me\nSo who really cares how you want me to be\nSee, I'm just mean staying at the top of the pile\nAnd doin' soft note tunes it ain't my style\nAnd this concludes our program\nOf how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam\nNow first we take an average drum\nGive it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb\nIt's no secret, that I sit alone at night\nPick up a pad and pen and begin to write\nAll kinda lyrics that's promised to play\nTo make everybody say\n\n[Sample]\n\"They can be cold and ruthless no question about that\nBut sometimes it's more complicated\"\n\n(Yo Dre)\n(You know what I want you to do?)\n(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)\n\n[Verse 4: MC Ren]\nNow MC Ren is here working like super glue\nNo matter what I do, I'm always stickin to you\nCause I'm the pusher, supplying the fix\nAnd this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix\nBut I'm making obstacles of enemy traps\nTo catch any MC's with the weakest raps\nCrucifyin in vain like just for usin my name\nThe definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game\nIf they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time\nCoz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme\nSo, you in the back of me just listen and learn\nBecause you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn\nNow my assignment was to give a preview\nSo at my next concert I wanna see you there\nNot sittin in a chair, standin on both feet with yo hand in the air\nNow I'm about to jet out but I'll be back\nBut next time expect a more funkier track\nDeep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion\nWith lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion\nThe prove that I'm hype and you know that's bet\nNow continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set"

Tell 'em what yo name is\nYeah something like that\nAlright, let's kick this shit on the one\nKick it\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren and Dr. Dre]\nBack by demand, now it's big as fuck\nBecause you as the public, you should know what's up\n\"Compton's in the House\" was more than gold, it was a hit\nCause it was based on some crazy shit\nSo our final conclusion has been permitted\nPunks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it\nBut that was a part of showbiz\nHey yo, homeboy, why don't you tell 'em what your name is\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren and Dr. Dre]\nWell for the record it's Ren, and for the street it's villain\nAnd strapped with a gat, it's more like Matt Dillon\nOn \"Gunsmoke\", but not a man of the law\nI'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw\nSee, I peep and then I creep on a fool\nGet my blood pressure high, but still stay cool\nDig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me\nThat really had the nerve that he could fuck with me\nWho was the man in the mask, while I was waitin' to ask\nYou know, it's MC Ren kickin' mucho ass\nGettin' respect in showbiz\nHey yo homeboy, what's up?\nWhy don't you tell 'em what your name is?\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]\nDre, the motherfuckin' doctor, bitch hopper\nThe sucker-motherfucker stopper\nBack with a vocal track that's a fresh one\nSo now, let's get the motherfuckin' session\nGoin', flowin'. It's time to start throwin' - rhymes\nSo keep in mind all the suckers I'm blowin'\nCause I'm a start showin' the time\nNever sayin' I'm the best and just goin' for mine\nUnlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy\nWhen their records only make good frisbees\nYou need to quit runnin' off the mouth\nStop and think before you put some whack bullshit out\nIt's not difficult, in fact it's kinda simple\nTo create something funky that's original\nYou either talkin' 'bout the place to be\nWho you are, what you got, or about a sucker MC\n\n[Interlude: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]\nOh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, Ren\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nYeah, I know what you're sayin', Dre, but you still ain't told 'em enough, man\nAlright, alright\nWell, let's kick one more verse right here, alright\nKick it\n\n[Verse 4: MC Ren & Dr. Dre]\nThis is portable, something to fuck with yo ear\nRen and Dre will appear when the sound is clear\nTo fuck it up like we always do, and that's the trick\nSayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks\nBut it's an everyday thang\nCommunicating to y'all with the Compton slang\nCompton's back in the house and your appartment\nSo open your door, by the way, so we can start it\nTest the monitors and call this mic\nCause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight\nI got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip\nBitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip\nWaitin' for the grand finale, or the end\nOr stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren\nWell, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster\nSmilin', like hell, as we move past the\nSuckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype\nWell we're positive and they're on a negative type\nAnd if think we're about to quit...\nMotherfucker you ain't heard shit\n\n[Dre]\nYeah, that shit was funky, you know what I'm sayin', Ren ?\n[Ren]\nI know what you're sayin', this is MC Ren and Dr.Dre\nCold kickin' it in the place\n[Dre]\nAh yeah, my mellow Eazy E in the house\nYella Boy in the house\nMy boy Ice Cube\nArabian Prince cold rockin' shit\n[Ren]\nOh yeah, hey, I'm a say whassup to my homeboys from CMW\n[Dre]\nYeah, hey, yo Ren, whatta we gonna call this shit?\n\"Tell'em what yo name is?\"\n[Ren]\nYeah something like that..."

Put the joint out!\nHey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car?\nDon't you know it's against the law to play music so god damn loud?\nShut the fuck up! Go to jail? Or gimme that shit you was just smoking\n\nMotherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat\nAnd that's some shit you betta not forget\n\n[Verse 2: Eazy-E]\nEazy E's the name feared by most\nWhen, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen\nBut on the streets there's two kinds of people\nWhite rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me\nPull over to the side, routine for me\nTearin' up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine\nBut they never find the shit\nAin't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit\nThinkin' everything is stolen\nBut can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin\nMaking more money than they ever make\nTaking more shit than they ever take\nYo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and\nKeep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin\nCause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin\nSo let me explain a lil somethin, yo\n\nSee, I got this problem, a big problem...\nCops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops\n\n[Hook]\n\nEpisode Two:\nGet out of the fuckin car!\nWait a god damn minute what the hell did I do?\nHey just shut the fuck up black bitch\nWait a minute, you ain't gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair! Let\nGo of my motherfuckin hair!\nHey just step the fuck back and shut up!\nGet your motherfuckin' hands off of me!\nCalm down, calm down now... listen, we're gonna go around this corner, and\nYou're gonna suck me and my partner's dicks, or you're gonna\nBe one black dead nigga bitch\n\n[The D.O.C.]\nPolice brutality is common in my neighborhood\nThat's why I hate them motherfuckers\n\n[Verse 3: MC Ren]\nI said fuck the police but with a little more force\nAnd maybe now I get my point across\nIt's a massacre goin on, just open your eyes and look\nEveryday a young nigga is took\nOff the face of the street by a police\nIt's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash\nYou can't leave out the city that they shacked up\nCause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up\nIt's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do\nIs say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote\nSo what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head\nTil you're dead with the steel-toe boot\nHarassin me with some kind of mind game\nActin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name\nYou call that right but when you're black there's no right\nSome recreational shit was only a gang fight\nSo shootin at the cops was a street thing\nTo waste time as we slanged off the cocaine\nBut everything was done just for peace\nTo retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin\n\n[Hook]\n\n(The final episode)\n\nEpisode Three:\nHey Juan, look at the piece of ass man\nWatch out watch out watch out homes!\nOh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car\nI didn't see that piece of caca!\nBetter act like you don't speak ingles homes\nWhat the fuck? Get your ass out of there, I've had enough\nOf your raggedy ass motherfucking shit!\nOh man no me pegues! por que me pegas? No! por favor no! No! Por que?\n\n[Hook x2]\n\nChinga tu pinche madre, pinche policias weys, pendejos, salvajes, culeros\u2026"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhat we gonna do right here is go back\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nNow, this is some shit that's from the days of wayback\nWhen niggas in Compton first started to jack\nWhen the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy\nIf you wasn't sellin' drugs\nSo many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged\nThey always loved that shit, they want a nigga that's sellin' keys\nBut nowadays, they workin' at Mickey D's\nBut in the days of wayback, I couldn't be laid back\nBecause I needed ends and I made that\nI get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and\nStart robbin' muthafuckas just like Cowboys and Indians\nAnythin' it took to get paid\nA nigga like Ren already had the plan made\nAnd I was in it to win it and not to lose\nAnd shit'd start blowin' up once I lit the fuse\nAnd police couldn't touch me because I was payin' 'em\nBut not with no money, yo, I was sprayin' 'em\nAnd never get caught because nobody is snitch\nBut one hoe did, so Ren had to shoot the bitch!\nNow she's in a coffin and my life is better off and\n'Cause everybody knows who's the boss and\nThat black nigga that they call Ren\nYou fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10!\nSo listen to me as I reminisce the days of wayback\nSo, check it out, y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nIt was once a time in the days of wayback\nWhen niggas was gettin' jacked\nIn fact, it was when I used to pass through the\nAnd kickin' ass through a muthafuckin' Compton Massacre\nNow, let me tell you a little somethin' about Compton\nWhen I was a kid and puttin' my bid in\nYo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm\nNow it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam\nEverybody killin', tryin' to make a killin'\nNiggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'\nWith so many ways to come up\nThe average nigga didn't give a fuck\nAbout another muthafucka in this game and\nClaimin' what he claimin', livin' like he livin', killin' after killin'\nMurder was a dirty job, to rob a dead man was the best plan\n'Cause a dead man never ran\nBut now your best friend is your worst friend\nGreed, kids to feed, make a me more some of what you holdin'\nSo, now your shit is stolen and you and your niggas start rollin'\nYo, to get your shit back ain't the word up\nMuff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder\nThey wanna make you think that it's a crack thang or a black thang\nOr some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang\nBut guns and money, they go together like the Ku Klux Klan\nA nigga brung up and strung up\nWhy do I call myself a nigga you ask me?\nRememberin' the days that's past me\nYo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest\nThe ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test\nAnd number one way for you to pass\nYo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass\nThey never in the wrong though so I made a song so\nMuthafuckas would know\nIf your livin' situations make you wanna get a gat (a gat)\nThat's 'cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback...\n\n[Outro]\nSurprise, niggas!\nYou don't think I could do it again, did ya?\nAnother album!\nThe jokes on you, Jack!\n(Yeah! Yeah! Ha ha ha ha! We did it again) We did it again!"

Never seen like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload, you see, it's about to over the hesitation\nAnd hear's the scream of the one, who got the last penetration\nGive a little gust of wind and I'm jettin'\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgettin'\nSo what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!\nYou think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!\nThis is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me\nYou'll get taken, by a stupid dope brotha' who will smother\nWord to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton\n\n[Outro: DJ Yella]\nCity of Compton!\nCity of Compton!"

Drop the gun\nYou could've prevented a tragedy\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nYou can approach, but the danger light is blinkin\nA self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinkin\nThis is a tribulation, the weak is judged\nThe prophecy was fulfilled, cause I never budge\nI took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme\nThey're seein doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream\nOne vision was of life, the other was death\nAnd life didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath\nSo you burn in my pit that I call hell\nWhere you got sent, because your shit don't sell\nMy twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke\nOf the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke\nI started doing them, I kept on doing them, two of them\nShoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them\nAnd my presence to the suckers was of a stranger\nBut fuck it, they can approach to the danger\n\n[Interlude: Eazy-E]\nIf you can be seen, you can be hit\nIf you can be hit, you can be killed\n(He's over there! Shoot him!)\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nFatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler\nOut run, the shot of a gun when the game's up\nMurder in the first degree, but it's worse to be\nA dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody\nWith everybody thinkin of death\nI kept workin, to be one of the last niggas left\nSo many people lookin for hope, they broke\nWithout checkin the fingerprints on a motherfucker's throat\nA heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me\nSo figure to see, the D-E-A-D\nBodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary\nSo it's very necessary to carry\nAmmunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution\nBefore Dre goes off\nAnd starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the\nAnger for the real nigga when I approach to danger\n\n[Interlude]\nApproach the motherfuckin danger\n(\"Come back to hell and see me some time!\")\n(\"This is it y'all\")\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E]\nFinal approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner\nAnother dead body and you wanna keep runnin\nBut even the rain turns black\nAll you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight\nNo prison, nobody makes bail\nEverybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail\nThink about death, takin your last breath\nHeart beatin like a motherfucker like it ain't no time left\nWith so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine\nEven though they wanna make a crime, yo\nOf bein real, a federal letter in the beginnin\nBecause of the release of \"Fuck the Police\"\nFuck it I approach the danger\nCause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up\nSo you might as well kiss your ass goodbye\nCause in the long run (\"we all die\")"

criticized for what we say\nBut I'm a do this shit anyway\nCause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\nYeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing\nYou are now\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\n[Outro: MC Ren]\nN.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990's\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E\nAnd I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all"

Hell no\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\n(Well for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain)\nDre the mothafuckin' doctor\n(Well for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain)\nYella boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky-ass beats?\nMy boy, my boy, my boy Ice Cube\n(Yo we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house)\nWon't you tell 'em what your name is?\n\n[Verse 7: MC Ren]\nMC Ren is the mothafucking coroner\nI'm getting rid of mothafucker as if they was a foreigner\nShow no grief to pretend when I sin\nA punch you can block it but I'm a still get in\nThis ain't a TKO in the first\nBut it's some shit from a nigga in black it's much worse\nThan a beat from Tyson, cause Ren is not nice and\nYour ass is better off just rollin' a dice and\nFinding you a number for luck\nCause you'll need it when you see I don't give a fuck\nMy identity, and the shit is getting shown\nWithout a video I'm still getting on\nI'm at a show then my picture is taking\nOne click of the flash and punk niggas are breaking\nTo the door, trying to join my fan club\nLip-syncing over one of my dubs\nThe instrumental will scratch for the moment\nUntil I fuck up the so called opponent\nThat's standing in the zone of the twilight\nSaying how in the fuck did he get mixed up in my fight\nIt wasn't a mistake, it was a set-up\nSo until I'm finished popping my lyrics you should shut up\nAnd don't attempt to speak\nBecause it's bad enough you rolling up shit creek\nWith a nigga like Ren about the hit\nNow let me hear you mothafuckers talk some more shit\nI'm a bust your ass in your mouth\nYo, unless you're saying - \"Compton's in the house\"\n\n[Verse 8: Dr. Dre]\nWho realy cares - about a sucker on a take off\nBust a move, we can have a shake n' bake-off\nMe and you can go cause I don't care yo\nRap fight or guerilla warfare\nWe can rumble, cause when my lungs go in and out\nI kick rhymes in a bundle to win a bout\nOr scurry or scuffle\nI just muffle the opposition, there's no competition\nLet them know that Dre is getting stronger\nCompton's in the house but now it's some longer\nI won't get set-up, shut up, I'm kinda fed up\nYou can say uncle and I still won't let up\nCause Dre is the mothafuckin' doctor\nAnd if me and Ren's on the mike it's like propaganda, no doubt\n(Boy you should've known by now) - Compton's in the house\n\n[Outro: Dr. Dre]\nYeah, it's time to put Compton on the map\nDon't ever think you can get it on, you stupid mothafuckas!"

   "lyrics": "[Ice Cube]\nI'm comin' straight outta Compton\nWhen something happens in south of central Los Angeles\nNothing happens, it's just another n**** dead\n\nVerse One: Ice Cube\nStraight outta Compton, crazy motherf***er named Ice Cube\nFrom the gang called n****z With Attitudes\nWhen I'm called off, I got a sawed off\nSqueeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off\nYou too, boy, if ya f*** with me\nThe police are gonna hafta come and get me\nOff yo a**, that's how I'm goin out\nFor the punk motherf***ers that's showin out\nN****z start to mumble, they wanna rumble\nMix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo\nGoin off on a motherf***er like that\nWith a gat that's pointed at yo a**\nSo give it up smooth\nAin't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move\nHere's a murder rap to keep yo dancin\nWith a crime record like Charles Manson\nAK-47 is the tool\nDon't make me act the motherf***in fool\nMe you can go toe to toe, no maybe\nI'm knockin n****z out tha box, daily\nYo weekly, monthly and yearly\nUntil them dumb motherf***ers see clearly\nThat I'm down with the capital C-P-T\nBoy you can't f*** with me\nSo when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck\nCoz Ice Cube is crazy as f***\nAs I leave, believe I'm stompin\nBut when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton\n\nChorus:\n[City of Compton, City of Compton]\n[Eazy E] Yo Ren\n[MC Ren] Whassup?\n[Eazy E] Tell em where you from!\n\nVerse Two: MC Ren\nStraight outta Compton, another crazy a** n****\nMore punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger\nI'm a bad motherf***er and you know this\nBut the p**** a** n****z won't show this\nBut I don't give a f***, I'ma make my snaps\nIf not from the records, from jackin the crops\nJust like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'\nAnd when illegally armed it's called 'packin'\nShoot a motherf***er in a minute\nI find a good piece o' p****, And go up in it\nSo if you're at a show in the front row\nI'm a call you a b**** or dirty-ass ho\nYou'll probably get mad like a b**** is supposed to\nBut that shows me, slut, you're composed to\nA crazy muthaf***er from tha street\nAttitude legit cause I'm tearin up s***\nMC Ren controls the automatic\nFor any dumb muthaf***er that starts static\nNot the right hand cause I'm the hand itself\nEvery time I pull a AK off the shelf\nThe security is maximum and that's a law\nR-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw\nSee, coz I'm the motherf***in villain\nThe definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin\nThat's takin place without a clue\nAnd once you're on the scope, your a** is through\nLook, you might take it as a trip\nBut a n**** like Ren is on a gangsta tip\nStraight outta Compton...\n\nChorus:\n[City of Compton, City of Compton]\n[Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...\n\nVerse Three: Eazy-E\n...straight outta Compton\nIs a brotha that'll smother yo' mother\nAnd make ya sister think I love her\nDangerous motherf***er raises hell\nAnd if I ever get caught I make bail\nSee, I don't give a f***, that's the problem\nI see a motherf***in cop I don't dodge him\nBut I'm smart, lay low, creep a while\nAnd when I see a punk pass, I smile\nTo me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a n**** drivin\nBut don't know where the f*** he's going, just rollin\nLookin for the one they call Eazy\nBut here's a flash, they never seize me\nRuthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration\nGive a little gust of wind and I'm jettin\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgettin\nSo what about the b**** who got shot? f*** her!\nYou think I give a damn about a b****? I ain't a sucka!\nThis is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever f*** with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother\nWord to the motherf***er, straight outta Compton\n\nChorus:\n[City of Compton, City of Compton]\n[And that kind of s*** you can't sweep up under no rug you know]"

   "lyrics": "* a different version than all previous releases\n\n[Intro: DJ Yella]\nEvery motherfucker always asks: how did N.W.A. get started!!\nWe don't know how it got started\nFuck that question, you know what I'm saying?\nIt's the same bullshit over and over\nHow did we get started?\nHow did we first meet?\n\n[MC Ren]\nPrisoner like a hostage\nYo, you should've covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich\nDeep in the dirt cause you was a sucker\nAnd your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker\nDon't try to hang, you best avoid it\nCause my foot will be so far up your ass, you'll get hemrroids\nBefore you try to fuck with Ren\nI'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting the size 10\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nFirst come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve\nStep up and get what you deserve\nFrom the world of the motherfucking Hip-Hop maniac\nBrainiac, so what you ought to do is step the fuck back\nBut how the fuck you think your rap would last?\nWith your ass saying shit that is said in the past\nYo, be original, your shit is sloppy\nGet off the dick, you motherfucking carbon copy\n\n[MC Ren]\nFalling deep in the drums for many of styles\nIs one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles\nCheating and not beating, the crowd are kept seating\nBut weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating\nStyles that kept them full of bull\nCause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full\nAnd got the nerve to cuss\nOnly reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nYo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do\nYou don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you?\nYou can't harm me, alarm me\nCause we're the generals in this fucking Hip-Hop army\nThe niggas with attitudes, if you didn't know\nWe blow, flow and then move slow from the get Go\nYo, tie us to take it\nYo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in\n\n[Chorus: Eazy-E]\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now   ----] Dr. Dre\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\n[MC Ren]\nYou can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find you\nCause a nigga like Ren, is only two steps behind you\nDon't look back, because you're shaking and all scared\nA nigga in black, can be your scariest nightmare\nSo sleep with the lights on, forget that the Mic's on\nDon't step on my motherfucking stage without Nike's on\nDon't say it's psycho, and then you just might go\nMentally fucked up, when I let the right blow\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nAll these niggas with the gibber gabber\nBut couldn't kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer\nGangsters in black are out there\nBut only because, yo, it's the shit that we wear\nOn my motherfucking dick\nBut I'ma love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick\nSo, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead\nYou'll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead\n\n[Eazy-E]\nBlack, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see\nA little street wise nigga, you know me\nRolling with some real niggas playing for keeps\nBut you motherfuckers know who run the streets\nWith that hardcore Hip-Hop rap shit\n[MC Ren] Now how much harder can another nigga get?\nTrying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us\n[MC Ren] Ashes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please\nSince you're on the dick, why don't you drop to your knees?\nCause I'm the motherfucker that's out to kill\nEazy-E, a nigga that's real\n\n(Timed bomb count down*)\n\n[Break: DJ Yella]\nReal niggas, straight off the streets of Compton\nQuick to get in your shit without a second thought\nAnd if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught\nSo if you're talking shit about the niggas in black (*Explosion*)\nBow down to the King's and Raider hats\n\n[MC Ren]\nThey played out, that's what niggas were chanting\nOne nigga left and they said: we ain't happening\nPeople had thought, we was finished and then done wit\nBut if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit\nYet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears\nAnd quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas\nAnd when the new record comes, I'll come like a fucking bump\nAsking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb\nYou're on the dicks of four niggas not one\nAnd when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one\nSo brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up\nBecause if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up\nDon't come in my face again, because I'm a floor you\nAnd if you're a bitch, I'ma fucking ignore you\nBecause my attitude is a little bigger\nCause MC Ren is one of the Real Niggas\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nLost in a motherfucking world of madness\nSadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest\nSucking motherfuckers like you, making whack jams\nBecause it only shows you how dope I am\nNever try to ignore us\nWhen I'm expressing, standstill like you're full of Rigor Mortis\nCause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure\nYou can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger\nDre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart\nA nigga that's paid; to say what others are scared to play\nWe started out with too much cargo\nSo I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold\nYo, N.W.A., criticized for what we say\nBut I'ma do the shit anyway\nCause I'm the motherfucking doctor, never faking\nYo, Yella, kick the motherfucking break in\n\n[Chorus: Eazy-E]\nIt's the real thing\nYou are now   ----] Dr. Dre\nReal, real niggas, niggas\nYeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing\nYou are now   ----] Dr. Dre\nReal, real niggas, niggas\n\n[Hook: MC Ren w/ echoes]\nN.W.A. - Straight Outta motherfucking Compton\nTaking over shit in all of the 1990s\nYo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E and I am MC Ren\nYo, N.W.A. taking over this motherfucker y'all"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nA 100 miles and runnin' - MC Ren, I hold the gun and\nYou want me to deal with the situation and it's done in\nSince I'm stereotyped I'm going to take a stand\nAnd if you try to stop me, I don't give a damn\nChances are usually not good\n'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood\nAnd gettin' jacked by the you-know-who\nWhen in a black and white the capacity is two\nWe're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers\nNot wearing medallions, 'cause we ain't going out like suckers\nThey're out to take our heads for what we said in the past\nAnd thats the reason why Ren is running fast\nI didn't stutter when I said \"Forget Tha Police\"\n'Cause it's hard for a brother to get peace\nNow it's broken and can't be fixed\n'Cause police and a kid from the ghetto don't mix so\nNow I'm creepin' through the fall\nRunnin' like a team, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all\nSo for now pack the gun and\nHold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'\n\n[Interlude]\nInto this news. Four fugitives are on the run\nFBI sources tell us that the four are headed\n100 miles to their homebase, Compton\n\n[Break: Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]\nShut up and lend me an ear\nSo I can tell you why\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nRunnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase\nWith a steady pace on the face that just we raced\nThe road ahead goes on and on\nIt even seems like its gettin' longer than a marathon\nRunnin' on but never runnin' out\nStayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out\nHitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do\nBut nobody's pickin' up a Brother Witta Attitude\nConfused, yo but Dre's never had nothin' to lose\nOne of the few who's been accused and abused\nOf the crime of poisonin' young minds\nBut you don't know nothin' til you been in my shoes\nAnd Dre is back from the C-P-T\nDroppin' some tracks that's D-O-P-E\nSo laid upon the P-O-L-I-C-E!\nAnd anybody else that disagrees\nStuck and runnin' hard, moving fast\n'Cause I been a brother known for havin' a notorious past\nMy mind was slick - my temper was too quick\nNow the FBI's all over my stick\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E]\nGot the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock\nThat's when the E jumped off the startin' block\nA 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch\nA little sprintin' young brother that they won't catch\nYeah, back to Compton again\nYo, it's either that or the Federal pen\n'Cause brothers been runnin' since beginning of time\nTakin' a minute just to tell you what's on my mind\nRunnin' like I just don't care\nCompton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there\nArchin' my back and on a straight rough\nJust like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the hell out\nFrom city to city I'm a menace as I pass by\nRippin' up things just so you can remember I'm\nA straight up brother that's done in, gunnin' and comin'\nStraight up homeboy, a 100 miles and runnin'\n\n[Interlude]\nThis one goes out to the four brothers from Compton\nYou're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:\nNowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide\nGood luck brothers\n\n[Verse 4: MC Ren]\nRunning for my life I hate to lose\nShow me on the news but I hate to be abused\nI know it was a set-up - so now I'm gonna get up\nEven if the FBI wants me to shut up\nBut I've got 10 000 brothers strong\nAnd as long as I got \"Run fast from the police\" song\nThey treat my group like dirt\nWhile their whole damn family is wearin' our T-shirts\nSo I'mma run til I can't run no more\n'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score\nI got a urge to kick down doors\nAt my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls\n\n[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]\nClouds are dark and brothers are hidin'\nAnd it's funny 'cause all these stupid suckers are riding\nWe started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it\nSo now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it\nThe number's even - now I'm leavin'\nWe're never gettin' took by a woman with a weave in\nHer and the troops are right behind me\nBut they're so stupid, they'll never find me\n\n[Verse 6: Eazy-E]\nOne more mile to go through the dark streets\nRunnin' like a tired brother on my own two feet\nBut you know I never stumble or lag last\nI'm almost home so I better run fast\nTearin' up everything in sight\nIt's a little crazy young brother dodging the searchlight\nNow that chase, is stopped and done and\nFour young brothers goin' crazy with\nA 100 miles of runnin'!\n\nStop! Stop! Stop! Stop!"

Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up\n[NWA] Man, fuck this shit\n[Cop] Aight smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nMC Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked-up incident?\n\n[MC Ren]\nFuck the police and Ren said it with authority\nBecause the niggas on the street is a majority\nA gang is with whoever I'm stepping\nAnd the motherfucking weapon is kept in\nA stash box for the so-called law\nWishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw\nLights start flashing behind me\nBut they're scared of a nigga\nSo they mace me to blind me\nBut that shit don't work, I just laugh\nBecause it gives em a hint, not to step in my path\nFor police, I'm saying, \"Fuck you punk!\"\nReading my rights and shit, it's all junk\nPulling out a silly club, so you stand\nWith a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand\nBut take off the gun so you can see what's up\nAnd we'll go at it punk, and I'mma fuck you up!\nMake you think I'mma kick your ass\nBut drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast\nI'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime\nBut I'mma smoke 'em now and not next time\nSmoke any motherfucker that sweats me\nOr any asshole that threatens me\nI'm a sniper with a hell of a scope\nTaking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me\nThe motherfucking villain that's mad\nWith potential to get bad as fuck\nSo I'mma turn it around\nPut in my clip, yo, and this is the sound\nYeah, something like that\nBut it all depends on the size of the gat\nTaking out a police, would make my day\nBut a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say\n\nFuck the police [4x]\n\n[NWA] Yeah man, what you need?\n[Cop] Police, open now\n[NWA] Aww shit\n[Cop] We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest\n[Cop] Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em (Move motherfucker, move now!)\n[NWA] What the fuck did I do, man what did I do?\n[Cop] Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)\n[NWA] But I didn't do shit\n[Cop] Man just shut the fuck up!\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nEazy-E, won't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?\n\n[Eazy-E]\nI'm tired of the motherfucking jacking\nSweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and\nShining the light in my face, and for what?\nMaybe it's because I kick so much butt\nI kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast\nOn a stupid-ass nigga\nWhen I'm playing with the trigger\nOf an Uzi or an AK\n'Cause the police always got something stupid to say\nThey put out my picture with silence\n'Cause my identity by itself causes violence\nThe E with the criminal behavior\nYeah, I'm a gangster, but still I got flavor\nWithout a gun and a badge, what do ya got?\nA sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot\nBy me or another nigga\nAnd with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger\n([MC Ren:] Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool)\nAnd as you all know, E's here to rule\nWhenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror\nAnd ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a\nDumb motherfucker with a gun\nAnd if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one\nThat I take out, and then get away\nWhile I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say\n\nFuck the police [4x]\n\nThe verdict\n\n[Dre] The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chickenshit motherfucker\n[Cop] Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!\n[Dre] Get him out of here!\n[Cop] I want justice!\n[Dre] Get him the fuck out my face!\n[Cop] I want justice!\n[Dre] Out, right now!\n[Cop] Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Dr. Dre & Ice Cube]\nDr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality\nIce Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is\nDr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]\nI'm expressing with my full capabilities\nAnd now I'm living in correctional facilities\n'Cause some don't agree with how I do this\nI get straight, meditate like a Buddhist\nI'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary\nBut my technique is very necessary\nBlame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predicate\nAdd it on a dope beat and it'll make you think\nSome suckers just tickle me pink\nTo my stomach, 'cause they don't flow like this one\nYou know what? I won't hesitate to diss one\nOr two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this\nSome drop science, well I'm dropping English\nEven if Yella makes it a cappella\nI still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess\nCause it's known to give a brother brain damage\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing\nBut making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel\n\n[Hook]\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nNow, getting back to the PG\nThat's program, and it's easy\nDre is back, new jacks are made hollow\nExpressing ain't their subject because they like to follow\nThe words, the style, the trend, the records I spin\nAgain and again and again, yo, you on the other end\nWatch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help\nThere's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself\nIt's crazy to see people be\nWhat society wants them to be, but not me\nRuthless is the way to go, they know\nOthers say rhymes that fail to be original\nOr they kill where the hip-hop starts\nForget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts\nSome musicians curse at home\nBut scared to use profanity when up on the microphone\nYeah, they want reality but you won't hear none\nThey rather exaggerate a little fiction\nSome say no to drugs and take a stand\nBut after the show they go looking for the dopeman\nOr they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say \"Hell no!\"\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...\n\n[Hook]\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]\n(Express yourself) From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart\nThen expression is a big part of it\nYou ain't efficient when you flow\nYou ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis\nThere's a little bit more to show\nI got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo\nOr a lesson, all of 'em expression\nAnd if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you\nI might ignore your record because it has no bottom\nI get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn\nIt's Dre on the mic, getting physical\nDoing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob\nYes, I'm macabre but you know you need this\nAnd the knowledge is growing, just like a foetus\nOr a tumor but here's the rumor\nDre is in the neighbourhood and he's up to no good\nWhen I start expressing myself, Yella slam it\nCause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage\nOr I'ma be too hyped and need a straight jacket\nI got knowledge and other suckers lack it\nSo, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic\nAsk what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight\nCause if I strike, it ain't for your good health\nBut I won't strike if you just\n\n[Hook x2]\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself\nCome on and do it"

I'm thinking Burger King\nAnd when I take you, you get frustrated\nYou can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it\nBut you see, I don't go nuts\nOver girls like you with the BIG ol' butts\nIt start comin out the pocket, to knock it\nBut when the damage is done\nYou can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl\nFor the simple fact that, I ain't the one\nI don't care how they look if they got money\nWe can hook up but they ain't gettin' none\nYeah, I just make 'em think they gonna get some\nPlay up they mind a lil' bit, and get that money\nOh Ice Cube, can I have some money please\nGive you money why bother\nCause you know I'm lookin' nothin' like your father\nGirl, I can't be played or ganked\nGanked means getting took for your bank\nOr your gold or your money or something\nNine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing\nThey get mad when I put it in perspective\nBut let's see if my knowledge is effective\nTo the brothas man they robbing you blind\n'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind\nKeep your money to yourself homie and if you got enough game\nYou'll get her name and her number without going under\nYou can't leave 'em and love 'em and stay above 'em\nI used to get no play now she stay behind me\n'Cause I said I had a Benz 190 but I lied and played the one\nJust to get some now she feels dumb to my homies it's funny\nBut that's what you get trying to play me for my money\nNow don't you feel used\nBut I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots\nYou shouldn't be, so damn material\nAnd try to milk Ice Cube like cereal\nNow how many times do I have to say it\n'Cause if I have to go get a gun, you girls will learn I don't burn\nYou think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one\nBut you said, you love me\nI don't see no rings on this finger\nWhy you doin' me like this? I love you\nYeah, you love my money, I got what I wanted, beat it"

Comin' straight from the underground\nA young nigga got it bad \u2018cause I'm brown\nAnd not the other color, so police think\nThey have the authority to kill a minority\nFuck that shit, \u2018cause I ain't the one\nFor a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun\nTo be beating on, and thrown in jail\nWe can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell\nFuckin' with me \u2018cause I'm a teenager\nWith a little bit of gold and a pager\nSearchin' my car, lookin' for the product\nThinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics\nYou'd rather see me in the pen\nThan me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o\nBeat a police out of shape\nAnd when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape\nTo tape off the scene of the slaughter\nStill getting swoll off bread and water\nI don't know if they fags or what\nSearch a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts\nAnd on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none\nBut don't let it be a black and a white one\n\u2018Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top\nBlack police showing out for the white cop\nIce Cube will swarm\nOn any motherfucker in a blue uniform\nJust \u2018cause I'm from the CPT\nPunk police are afraid of me\nHuh, a young nigga on the warpath\nAnd when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath\nOf cops, dying in L.A\nYo, Dre, I got something to say\n\n[Hook]\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\n\n[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]\nPull your goddamn ass over right now!\nAww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?\n\u2018Cause I feel like it!\nJust sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!\nMan, fuck this shit!\nA'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!\nMC Ren, will you please give your testimony\nTo the jury about this fucked up incident?\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nFuck the police! And Ren said it with authority\nBecause the niggas on the street is a majority\nA gang is with whoever I'm steppin'\nAnd the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in\nA stash box, for the so-called law\nWishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw\nLights start flashing behind me\nBut they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me\nBut that shit don't work, I just laugh\nBecause it gives them a hint not to step in my path\nFor police, I'm saying, \"Fuck you, punk!\"\nReading my rights and shit, it's all junk\nPulling out a silly club, so you stand\nWith a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand\nBut take off the gun so you can see what's up\nAnd we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!\nMake you think I'ma kick your ass\nBut drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast\nI'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime\nBut I'ma smoke them now and not next time\nSmoke any motherfucker that sweats me\nOr any asshole that threatens me\nI'm a sniper with a hell of a scope\nTaking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me\nThe motherfuckin' villain that's mad\nWith potential to get bad as fuck\nSo I'ma turn it around\nPut in my clip, yo, and this is the sound\n(Gunshot sounds)\nYeah, somethin' like that\nBut it all depends on the size of the gat\nTaking out a police would make my day\nBut a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say\u2026\n\n[Hook]\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\n\n[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]\n(Knocking sounds)\nYeah, man, what you need?\nPolice, open out!\nAww, shit\nWe have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest\nGet down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!\n(Move, motherfucker, move now!)\nWhat the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?\nJust shut the fuck up\nAnd get your motherfucking ass on the floor!\n(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)\nBut I didn't do shit\nMan, just shut the fuck up!\nEazy-E, won't you step up to the stand\nAnd tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]\nI'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'\nSweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and\nShining the light in my face, and for what?\nMaybe it's because I kick so much butt\nI kick ass, or maybe \u2018cause I blast\nOn a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger\nOf an Uzi or an AK\n\u2018Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say\nThey put out my picture with silence\n\u2018Cause my identity by itself causes violence\nThe E with the criminal behavior\nYeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor\nWithout a gun and a badge, what do you got?\nA sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot\nBy me, or another nigga\nAnd with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger\n(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)\nAnd as you all know, E's here to rule\nWhenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror\nAnd ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a\nDumb motherfucker with a gun\nAnd if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one\nThat I take out, and then get away\nWhile I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say\n\n[Hook]\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\n\n[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]\nThe verdict:\nThe jury has found you guilty of being a redneck\nWhite bread, chickenshit motherfucker\nWait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!\nGet him out of here!\nI want justice!\nGet him the fuck out my face!\nI want justice!\nOut, right now!\nFuck you, you black motherfuckers!\n\n[Hook]\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!\nFuck tha police!"

Fuck fuck fuck the police!\n[Fuck them motherfuckers!]\nFuck fuck fuck the police!\n[Get paid back] You're motherfucking right yo\n\nVerse One: Dr. Dre\n\nFuck the motherfucking police!\nThey don't want peace they want a nigga deceased\nSo he'll cease to be a problem and by the way the perform\nIt seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform\nAnd yo the black police, the house niggas\nThey gave you a motherfucking gun, so I guess you figure\nYou made out, good to go, but you didn't know\nThey would stick your black ass back in the ghetto, yo\nTo kill another nigga, catch him with crack, in fact\nFreebase - they put in the neighborhood in the first place\nBut the brothers ain't stupid, remember that\nYou got a gat, I got a gat, so whassup with that\nA to the motherfuckin K\nThe last words you hear, then the smoke appears\nTears, from your motherfuckin family\nThey're starin at me, but I'm goin gun happy, fuck em!\nShootin everything in sight tonight's the night to get hyped\nAnd fight for what's wrong, fuck what's right!\nAnd by the way, my name is Dre\nSo listen up motherfucker to what I gotta say, yo\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTRO 2\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChorus:\n\nFuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police\nFuck\nFuck, fuck, fuck the police\n[Now for the first episode]\n\nVerse Two: Eazy-E\n\nEazy E's the name feared by most\nWhen, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen\nBut on the streets there's two kinds of people\nWhite rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me\nPull over to the side, routine for me\nTearin up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine\nBut they never find the shit\nAin't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit\nThinkin everything is stolen\nBut can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin\nMaking more money than they ever make\nTaking more shit than they ever take\nYo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and\nKeep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin\nCause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin\nSo let me explain a lil somethin, yo\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTRO 3\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSee, I got this problem, a big problem...\nCops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops\n\nChorus:\n\nFuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police\nFuck\nFuck, fuck, fuck the police\n[Fuck the police!]\n\nPolice brutality is common in my neighborhood\nThat's why I hate them motherfuckers\n\nVerse Three: MC Ren\n\nI said fuck the police but with a little more force\nAnd maybe now I get my point across\nIt's a lot here that's goin on, just open your eyes and look\nEveryday a young nigga is took\nOff the face of the street by a police\nIt's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash\nYou can't leave out the city that they shacked up\nCause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up\nIt's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do\nIs say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote\nSo what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head\nTil you're dead with the steel toe boot\nHarassin me with some kind of mind game\nActin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name\nYou call that right but when you're black there's no right\nSome recreational shit was only a gang fight\nSo shootin at the cops was a street thing\nTo waste time have to explain don't do cocaine\nBut everything was done just for peace\nTo retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin\n\nChorus:\n\nFuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police!\nFuck\nFuck the police! Fuck, fuck the police!"

Aight!\nParental discretion is advised for the moment\nWhile I'm getting candid, now understand it\nAin't too typical in any way, though the pro\nOn the mic is the D.O. to the C., this is an intro\nI know The D.O.C. makes you want to take a Valium\nSo buy a bucket cause upcoming is my album\nAnd for the record, meaning my record, check it\nListen to the single and you'll be like, yo, I gotta get it\nBut in the meantime, listen to the rhyme\nOf the Dr. Dre played with N.W.A\nYella's on the drum roll, rocking the beat\nAyo Dre, where's you gonna take this ---- man?\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre (The D.O.C)]\nAyo, let's take it to the street (word up!)\nLet 'em understand perfection\nLet knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing\nCause I don't give a damn about a radio play\nObserve the English I display\nLyrics for the adults, children have been barred\nAnd scarred from listening to something so [censored] hard\nDope, pumping that's so my rhymes will never falter\nYo it's Dre, forget the \"Mind of Minolta\"\nPsycho like no other dumb brother\nSo step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O\nBut be warned, never will I leave like a regular\nCause I'm a little better than the regular competitor\nI use to see 'em on stage\nEarning money like a thief, but without a gauge\nUntil I got full, of clocking the lame getting pull\n(They said you wasn't gon' get paid)\nNah that's bull, yo, they like it stylistic\nAnd I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic\n(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashing when I'm in action\nA photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion\nPure simplicity, see, it's elementary\nYou hear one of the hardest young brothers this century\nTry to comprise a word to the wise and the guys\nParental discretion is advised\n\n[Verse 2: MC Ren]\nRen is most extremely high performance\nThe black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous\nSome trash I don't take it, not even in a toilet\nAnd trash from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it\nTurn up the pilot as it burns\nAnd maybe the stupid suckers'll learn\nI'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible\nNot considered a prince, 'cause I'm a principal\nI'm engineering the funky sound that you're hearing\n'Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steering\nSilly you say, I say you're silly when you say it\nRushing to the eject, to put my tape in and play it\nIt's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur\nAnd I really don't care while I'm damaging ya\nIt's for the record, yo, so my lyrics is gonna spin it\nAnd if there was a trophy involved, I'd win it\nPossession is mine and I'm the holder\nCause a brother like Ren don't really care cause I'm older\nSo for you to step off would be wise\nAnd say forget it, parental discretion is advised\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nI be what is known as a bandit\nYou gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it\nCause if you fail to see, read it in braille\nIt'll still be funky, so what's next is the flex\nOf a genius, my rapid-stutter-stepping if you seen this\nDope, you hope that I don't really mean this\nBut if play made a greater high-top fade\nIt's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark\nYou guess it was a test of a different style\nIt's just another dope brother on the pile\nDriving around with the flow of the tongue\nYou hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung\nTo your attention, by the hardest rapping artist\nThat is known for lynching any sucker in a minute\nStagger 'em all\nWhen I start flowing like Niagara Falls\nIce Cube is equipped to rip it up in a battle\nMove like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle\nI get low on the flow so let your kids know\nWhen I bust, parental discretion is a must\n\n[Verse 4: Eazy-E]\nLittle did they know, that I would be arriving\nAnd it's surprising, rocking it from where I been\nBut it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made\nIn the trade where funky dope records are being played\nDamn the regular, yo as I get better the\nGirls wanna trick and go stupid up on the tip\nSo I get 'em hot, thinking they're gonna get it\nAs they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket\nTo you it may be funny, but\nThere's no service of beef without money\nSo slip the C-note, and you can choke\nOn a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat\nForeplay to me ain't it\nWhen you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get a hit\nFrom the Eaze, if you can deal with the size, but if you can't\nParental discretion's advised!"
