Camp]\nAll I need is one more drank, two more blunts, three more bitches\nFour more zips, five more minutes\nAll I need is one more drank, one more drank\nAll I need is one more drank, one more drank\n\n[Verse 1: Juicy J]\nAll I need is one more skank, dirty pussy, suck my dick\nScary movie, I let her use me, all in her mouth\nMy dick in her booty, we all on the couch, the cameras is out\nAnd she say she a virgin, bitch, shut the fuck uuupp!\nI'm 'bout my bread, gettin' throwed, gettin' blowed\nGettin' trippy, gettin' lit on these hoes\nFuck 'em slow, in my cup, Colt .45, high as fuck\nTwenty dab, hundred for the thousand dollar tab\nConjure my cab\n\n[Hook x2: K. Camp]\n\n[Verse 2: K. Camp]\nLook, all she need is one more shot, that bitch lit, you can tell\nPut this package, in yo box, you got mail\nSmoke one more, touch that cloud, this that loud\nThat lil bitch, she get active, she get wild\nWe turnt up, too much liquor you can't hold me\nLiked her pic, fucked her friend, now she know me\nDrop my top, out that roof, that's that Rollie\nGirl don't play, I'm right here, you gon' show me\n\n[Hook x2: K. Camp]\n\n[Verse 3: Juicy J]\nDamn I miss the '90s, yeah shit was wild\nWe was livin' like rock stars, droppin' Mystic Styles\nAin't nobody else believe in what we was puttin' down\nNigga almost homeless trying to get it off the ground\nNo support everybody thought we never be shit\nTryna start our own label on some Master P shit\nTryna get some distribution majors labels ain't feelin' us\nDoors slammed in our face, still ain't givin' up\nStill on the grind, still on the rise\nEven had to sell my whip to pay for studio time\nMade a name, made some change, got respect, got some fame\nNow they love our shit, cuz we made our own lane\nTryna sign everybody, put some money in their pockets\nHad a ball on the rug, every night we had it poppin'\nThey ain't hold us down, did it on our own\nWith our backs on da wall, we put plaques on the wall\nThen the problems started picking up, posse start splitting up\nPeople started switching up, we still not giving up\nI love them though, we been through it all\nThey're my brothers though, now that's some real shit\nWe weren't always rich, we didn't have a pot to piss\nHustle harder than a bitch, slanging records like they bricks\nFrom the ground to the throne, its been a hell of a trip\nBring me one more drank, while I sit and reminisce"

I'm the sponsor\nWe just flew over Dubai, we just made love in the sky, we just might never come back, it's what they call a perfect match\nHop in the new Lamborghini, in your new Gucci bikini, we used to sit on martinis, now we sippin' on bellinis\nDedication turn to frustration, all we needed was a conversation, medication, and some meditation\nAll we needed was a little patience\nAll she needed was the perfect guy, all I needed was a ride-or-die\nAll she ever asks is that I try, all I ever ask is never lie\nTakin' pictures of expensive dinners, makin' babies in expensive rentals\nNever endin', but we just beginnin', we just started but we never finished\nThis is everything you ever wanted, this is everything you ever needed\nThis is everything you wanted and more, I know you complete it\nThis is more than you can ask for, filling papers in your passport\nWould you really rather ride for?\nOr would you really rather die for?\nI'm on a road to Sri Lanka, I'm on a road to Sri Lanka, I'm on a road to Sri Lanka\n(Fix your face!)\n\n[Outro]\nRubba Band Business 3 comin' soon, my new album, and download my new single, \"New English\", featuring Travi$ Scott, on iTunes.

Blowin' light cause I got it\nIf my goons knew how to swim they'd be sharks mixed with piranhas\nFashion shows out in Paris, all my weed is designer\nI don't talk business on the phone\nIf the money ain't texting I ain't home\nIt's not up to me how your bitch getting home, I fucked her\nShe just wanted Juicy on the night that you loved her\nKnock knock, nigga don't you dare\nNiggas in the grass with their choppers in the air\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nCrack a nigga head with the Ace of Spades\nWorldstar put you on the front page\nCongratulations, you finally made it\nPussy nigga, you finally famous\nThese rap niggas, these rap niggas\nIn real life ain't moving shit\nHalf the shit just sound good\nYou niggas living in a movie clip\n20 years in, you new to this\nI'm a shark nigga, you a tuna fish\nAll my cars got smart start\nDamn bitch, I'm stupid rich\nStupid bitch, that's hella paid\nPromethazine in my lemonade\nGot a private loft in MIA\nNo competition I'm in my lane"

My nigga it's a wrap\nYou a felon and you lucky if they even shake your hand\nMane you crazy if you think they giving us a second chance\n\n[Hook]\nNigga got a hundred pills, tryna pay the bills\nGet a hundred years, where the justice at?\nWhite boy, same job, shed a couple tears\nNever see a cell, where the justice at?\nCatch you with that bomb, you not going home\nYou ain't got no bond, where the justice at?\nAnd cops will gun you down, cause you tryna run\nSwear they saw a gun, where the justice at?\n\n[Outro]\nMane, where the justice at?\nWhere the justice at?\nWhere the justice at?\nYou know everything ain't really about race man\nIt's motherfuckers out here just doin what the fuck they wanna do\nAnd thats fucked up\nWhere the justice at?"

You know how that shit go man\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nNiggas say you changed, you know how it go\nThey gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go\nThey gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nThey gon' sell they soul for the price of gold\nThey get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold\nYou already know, you know how it go\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey love you when you down, they hate you when you up\nEspecially when you can't always help them up\nDon't give out no hand outs cause' that'll mess em' up\nAfter a while, you gon' find yourself catching up\nPay attention to the ones that imitate ya\nNever fear one that try to intimidate ya\nSelf preservation, that's the first law of nature\nThey can't get none of your paper they assassinate ya\nIt's just a vicious cycle, look what they did to Michael\nLook what they did to Martin Luther, nigga they a shoot ya\nLook what they did to Malcolm X don't wanna be your idol\nJust don't go against the grain this shit is suicidal\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nNiggas say you changed, you know how it go\nThey gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go\nThey gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nThey gon' sell they soul for the price of gold\nThey get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold\nYou already know, you know how it go\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, so I still keep that kush lit\nReal nigga, I still be on that hood shit\nAnd I'm still sippin that good shit\nStill be gettin' that money give me one reason I should quit (hell nah)\nI might boss up and get mo' dough\nFeeling presidential so I'm ridin' round' in that four door\nLookin' like a lick you get a couple of racks on my photo\nIf that bag there, then there ain't nowhere that I won't go\nBut everything ain't what it seem, you know what I mean\nJust cause' niggas always on the scene don't mean they with the team\nIt started with a dream, wish you could see what I seen\nWish that I could go diamond and put it in my ring\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nNiggas say you changed, you know how it go\nThey gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go\nThey gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nThey gon' sell they soul for the price of gold\nThey get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold\nYou already know, you know how it go\n\n[Verse 3]\nLast of my kind, ain't no mo' niggas like me\nSay my name around your bitch she get over excited\nGive me head with no hands, hoe you know how I like it\nI keep a tool with some rubbers, bitch I'm strapped like I'm ISIS\nI know niggas in they feelings, meanwhile I'm in these millions\nGotta GPS my house, ain't been home in a minute\nAin't been home in like forever, I been getting to the cash\nSendin' Kate to touch the stage, pussy nigga do the math\nMy fingers, they itchin' for that paper like a rash\nSilly bitches call me broke, must be tryna make me laugh\nNiggas say I changed, if I did, why you mad?\nNiggas still ain't bout' they paper gotta leave em' in the past\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nNiggas say you changed, you know how it go\nThey gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go\nThey gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nThey gon' sell they soul for the price of gold\nThey get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold\nYou already know, you know how it go\n\n(Outro: Juicy J & DJ Blak)\nYou know how it go, you know how it go\nNiggas don't be wantin' you to [?] shit out here man. You know the fucked up part about it? They be madder than a mother fucker man. Don't you post nothin' on Instagram or nothing, oh they really gon' get mad. Niggas have a fit, niggas be wantin' to kill they selves. Man fuck em'. Keep smokin\nJuicy said \"aye Blak! Let's go to a foreign country some shit we ain't never been before\"\nI said \"iight man let's gas up the jet. Where you wanna go?\"\nHe said \"man let's go to Sri Lanka\"\nI said \"cool man let's go\"\nJuicy J, DJ Blak nigga fix your face"

I'm tellin' you bruh, they ain't who they say they is... Or who they claim to be. You gotta trust yourself man, you wanna do anything, get something done, just do it yourself. Fuck a nigga.

We gets money\nCame from the bottom nigga now ain't that somethin?\nBeen through the struggle but now I see it was worth it\nFeels mighty good to shine\n\n[Verse 1: Billy Wes]\nFast life, fast girls\nFast cars getting money in this fast world\nI'm getting used to this, and now I'm spoiled rotten\nGimme gimme gimme boy I enjoy stuntin\nIce cold Bombay and the best of Kush\nI keep a driver on deck, that's the way I push\nSold out shows. Girls gone wild\nWhere they clothes go? In the money pile\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Juicy J]\n(Let's go. Let's go)\nChampagne life. So much money, can't even count it\nMy account need a accountant to help him out\nI can't help it I'm addicted to this lifestyle\nLife a bitch but if you pimp her then you might smile\nCloset full of Louis. Garage full of toys\nMy whole family eating like them Jackson boys\nIt ain't paper chasing if that paper chasing you\nI just collect it, sign the checks, I know you hate the truth\n\n[Hook]"

Still high\nStill like fuck you niggas (Pussy!)\n\n[Verse 1 Juicy J]\nI don't play with guns but we call them toys\nTotin' big straps that make a lot of noise\nTalking big money, niggas better know it\nGun never on safety, I'm paranoid\nI don't pull it out unless I'm 'bout to shoot\nI got military guns, I got goons too\nTryna' find me, where your black suit\nYou think you gon' catch me slippin', you a damn fool\nMy bitches strapped, they keep it in they purse\nTryna' ride up on me now you ridin in  a hearse\nThat trippy shit, I'm on another planet (mars)\nNiggas hating on me I bullet proofed the phantom\nRidin' in a black car, ridin' with a black bag\nBlack gloves, black hoodie, ridin' with a black mask\nI know niggas scared, so don't try to flex\nA couple of bullets hit his body tore up his chest\n\n[Hook]\nA hundred rounds, I won't miss ya ass\nPut your ass on a shirt saying they miss your ass\nYour family miss you, your girl miss you\nThe niggas miss you, Juicy J I won't miss ya\nI won't miss ya [x3] Juicy J I won't miss ya [repeat]"
