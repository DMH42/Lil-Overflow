We're helpless romantics\nWe can not help who we're attracted to\nSo let's all dance, and elevate each other\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nLook at this energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho? Cleopatra? Please\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothin' to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\n\n[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]\nWhy, why do I have to lie?\nPretend, make believe or hide, uh\nWhen I love what I've described\nBut then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nLook at this energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho? Cleopatra? Please\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothin' to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, girl on girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nLook at this energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho? Cleopatra? Please\nNot even Joan of Arc (Whats wrong with that?)\nThat don't mean nothin' to me (Hey)\nI just want a different girl (Uh)\n\n[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]\nWhat's wrong with that? Yeah\nWhat's wrong with that?\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n[Interlude: Kelly Osbourne]\nIn honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it\nWe say thank you, and we take it back\n\n[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]\nWished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true\nThen my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon\nI put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you\nSince now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nLook at this energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho?

Can you hear me now?\n\n[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]\nCan I have it like that? (You got it like that)\nCan I have it like that? (You got it like that)\nCan I have it like that? (You got it like that)\nCan I have it like that? (You got it like that)\nSo drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)\nAnd act like you tryin' to get this money right quick\nSo can I have it like that? (You got it like that)\nCan I have it like that? (You got it like that)\n\n[Verse 2: Pharrell]\nOn and on and, this beat is on and\nI control their mind from straight over the phone\nAnd let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist\nAnd never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious (Yes, Sir)\nFrom Louisville to Jimmy Choos, he's real\nShe know the time, she sees the Richard Mille\nPlat-double skeletal, Tourbillion\nIt's just like her body, move, it turns her on\nShe like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers\nAnd all our car doors go up like Transformers\nSee, I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way\nFrom the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway\nSo cool it like New Edition unless you hot as you say\nI get it, okay, let it boil away\nBut please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong\nAnd I got something right for them right after this song\nMy name is Skate... board...

(You got it like that)\n\n[Verse 3: Pharrell]\nOn and on and, the temperature is warm and\nI spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous\nBright as a bitch, so analyze with caution\nWhen the light hit the ice, bet a hundred that you vomit\nAnd should I mention the fact the Transition is the track?\nNo incision to the vision just to get me where I\u2019m at, huh\nLittle Skateboard, he too grown (Come on)\nRidin' up and down Collins in that that new Two-Tone\nIt's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh)\nJust stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh)\nI don't smoke but I bet the sense a mil' of it\nTotally intensifies the vivid-ass appeal of it\nYou can be jealous, and grit your teeth (Uh huh)\nBut all these little niggas got somethin' in reach\nSo, you want heat? These niggas can front heat\nWhile I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseek\nMy name is Skate... board... P\nLadies and Gentlemen (Oh)\n\n[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]\nCan I have it like that?

Better learn something, son\nYou be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums?\nLook, ooh, you see me, Ma, they wish they could be me, Ma\nAs I got better, her body was eaten by leukaemia\nSeventh grade, it was cursed and sad\nBut the gift within it was when I first met Chad\nBut even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed\n'Cause Grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th\nI can't help but wonder what kind of black cloud I was under\n'Cause fifteen years later, the other died that summer\nBummer\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell]\nMy best friend told me (What?)\nYou be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)\nBut the weight of the world can really crush one's mind\nSo let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)\nLet it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)\nSee, you won't even know you hurt sometimes\nUntil you in conversations, it comes out in a line\nSo let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)\nLet it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out\n\n[Verse 2: Pharrell]\nAyo, 1021 Atlantis Drive, nigga was action packed\nThat's Atlantis Apartments, we live in half the back\nThat's where the 12-year-olds there, they be flashing crack\nAnd when they shoot you, nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back\nAyo, Didi, Fleet and Marvian, can you imagine that?\nThe place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat\nBut I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passionate\nNow I got my skate team and spit these acid raps\nSo many niggas will rise, so many them niggas try\nSo many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied\nSo many them same niggas, man, they moms eyes cry\nSo, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride\nWell, let me tell you niggas something, I'm so glad you alive\nLong as you got a breath, a pulse, nigga strive\nDivine intervention this is, I heard a voice, nigga, listen to this\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell]\nMy best friend told me (What?)\nYou be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)\nBut the weight of the world can really crush one's mind\nSo let it out, P (What?)

Let it out, P (What?)\nLet it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out (Okay)\n\n[Verse 3: Pharrell]\nJesus will arrange it, but Jesus won't change it\nHold yourself responsible, on yourself, you blame it\nYou mad, nigga don't articulate in Sans Script\nI.E. we best friends, speak best friend language\nI'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish\nWhoever said anything worth working for would be painless?\nCan't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous\n'Cause you both on Bape, BBC and chain-less\nAlso you're Range-less, therefore switch lane-less\nNow you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless\nAll of a sudden you smart, now you do something heinous\nFirst time you get caught, now your ass is famous\nNo longer chain-less, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look\nYour girl with ya man sellin' lane-less, stop\nNigga, rewind and reverse slides three times\nReassess your thinking and trust me, it'll be fine\nFirst, picture your goal, and repeat, \"It'll be mine\"\nOr fuck it, nigga, just keep imagine killin' me, fine\nNow you scrunching your face, tryna ace attainment\nWhen you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga\nSuccess is tangible, don't wait for fame\nI thought you would receive it better if I ain't say your name\nYou unsure of yourself, sit still and think\nReview those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell]\nMy best friend told me (What?)\nYou be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)\nBut the weight of the world can really crush one's mind\nSo let it out, P (What?)

Mr. Vener!\nUh-huh, yo, hola\n\n[Verse 1]\nBillionaire Club muchacho\nAssorted flavors in these helados\nInspire young minds, and stack my nachos\nWith the raw determination of a vato\nRun across the border with bricks in his poncho\nFace like a shot when it's bussin' by glocko\nPlanning these things 'til I die\nWhen the Holy Father hand me my wings, when I was young, yo\nThe teacher couldn't stand when we dreamed\nGiving me music like drugs in the hand of a fiend\u2014and shoot it up\nSee me on the TV, the cuties, they wanna fuck\nBoth residential that's plush and couped it up\nGot more hits than a zip, who want it nuh?\nI can go back in time, you be Judge Ito\nWith my minute repeater, I know you're thinking \"neat-o!\"\nIt repeats the minutes, something like your TiVo\nBut it's three-hundred-thousand more with no remote\nJacob and Lorraine, I used to deal with Tito\nBut he clowned me and told me that my money's fritos\nNow the Enzo doors go up like a D-Lo\nRee-on, same song sung by my man Nigo\nSLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh L jar\nNigga, we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost\nYessir!\n\n[Chorus]\nMy nigga, close your eyes\nJust picture yourself just holdin' pies\nImplement a plan and you surely rise\nThis promised by the man that controlled the skies\nDon't you see? I know that shit so ill\nBetter yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel\nHaha, how you feel, dawg?\nWe just picture thinkin', dreamin', schemin'\nBleedin', readin', all in the late night\nShakin', boilin', lacin', bakin'\nShapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right\nAs I serve it, you just burn it\nBreathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight\nNigga, how does it feel? Haha, yessir\n\n[Verse 2]\nNigga, you don't know me\nI'm part Howard Hughes, part horny, part holy\nFirst trick on the ramp is the rockin' rollie\nKeep one on my staff with a new pro chromey\nIt bequeaths me to mention that I've been bitten\nBut affords me to chuckle at what critics have written\nHe dresses insane, but his music admire\nAsk Anna Wintour from Vogue and Esquire\nAnd Vanity Fair; you like Kennedy here\nBut you should guess who's in the insanity chair\nNow it ain't about what I want\nStill thumbin' through my life like it's drugstore porn\nIt's one thing to say that you did it\nIt's one thing to lie about your digits\nIt's one thing to say that you live it\nIt's another for you fuckers to admit it\nBut I admit I got all this paper\nPlus the prettiest faces that's offered by nature\nI drive a cas'per, 'scuse me, Casper\nWanna meet 'em in my house, I got space like NASA\nBut it don't make me happier by itself, or sadder\nOr like my sister Stace when she lost her pappa\nOr Ben dad gettin' a stroke, and nothin' that Trapper\nJohn could do; it's ironic but true\nA man dies, baby born, it's fair as Peru\nIt's a simple clue between us and imposters\nWe hop in the air and don't care what it costs us\nNow I'm with N.E.R.D. with a pit full of moshers\nI guess you could say that we fly like saucers\nZappin' at niggas, we're classin' at vigor\nThe cash and crash whippers, the Thrasher mag gripper\nGo 'head and say it: \"You a rappin' ass nigga\"\nYessir!\n\n[Chorus]\nMy nigga, close your eyes\nJust picture yourself just holdin' pies\nImplement a plan and you surely rise\nThis promised by the man that controlled the skies\nDon't you see? I know that shit so ill\nBetter yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel\nHaha, how you feel, dawg?\nWe just picture thinkin', dreamin', schemin'\nBleedin', readin', all in the late night\nShakin', boilin', lacin', bakin'\nShapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right\nAs I serve it, you just burn it\nBreathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight\nNigga, how does it feel?

Smilin' still, call your girlfriend (Why?)\nYou fell asleep at the wheel\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nAnd don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit\nTryna ask me shit, c'mon\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyo, I walk in brashest, certainly the crassest\nThe restaurant's classes, the owner is asses\nShit, my money green like the helmet of a fascist\nSo what you want\u00a0\u2013 Patron or Petrucia glasses?\nAin't no mystery, his daughter know the history\nAnd every night we toast like it's victory, get with me\nAnd I ain't changed since my early mental\nI been snackin' on shrimp and sippin' on Shirley Temples\nNo drug to drinkin' \u2013 what you want?\nNo, seriously, what you thinkin'? Since the Yukon\nNever puffed a J, you can ask Loushawn\nBack when he pushed beige like it was coupons\nWith a house full of dames like it was Moulin\nI would ask they names, but they would only do Sean\nAnd I ain't sayin they regret it, but fuck it, they do\n'Cause if they could reverse time, nigga\nWhat would they do, huh?\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nAnd don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit\nTryna ask me shit, c'mon\n\n[Verse 3]\nHoneys Panamanian, eyes like Iranian\nLighter than the blue of the sky of the day we in\nAss like a volleyball, the kind that make your dick hard\nHead to the hustlers, so sweet she could get cars\nNow she here with me, lil' Skateboard P\nCheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps\nI spit, then I hit, then I murk, yessir\nA flick chico stick and a Twix, that's her\nShe admire how the champion live\nHow I signed Slim Thug with a ramp in my crib\nI'm a champion, I do as the champions did\nExcept I improve with the new and the rest get rid\nBut some of y'all don't like that, it's easy tryna bite back\nInstead of sayin' hi, gettin' fly, but I'll be right back\nMy dude got the steel if you think you fly\nShoot the wings off your ego and watch you skydive, yessir\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nAnd don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit\nTryna ask me shit, c'mon"

You can't be serious\n(I think so)\nYou niggas can't be serious (I think so)\n(This is what they wanted)\n\n[Verse 1]\nTuff guy nada, but it spots shit Ohada\nFinish with the spinach Like the little nigga Popeye\nScarf by Escada, boots by Prada\nHermes bag and rag and sex with Yada Yanna\nLiberace chains, hold my neck like an anchor\nLove to my fans, you bought it so I thank ya\nIf you're a hater then I'm glad that I ain't ya\nCouldn't see the light like baby Jesus in a manger\nWe wanted this life we salivated like wolves\nBlow a hundred grand on L.V. leather goods\nLift up the doors, open trunk, open hood\nEnzo horse power, crank it up and hear the hooves\nMy notebook was my hustle and flow stash\nYoung and ludicrous, my life had just crashed\nOooh had a chilly chilly past\nLook at the Ice Cream symbol that's why the nigga laugh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm all about angels so I try to do that\nBut I only ended up with burning stubs on my back\nSo with that said lil' Skateboard's back\nOn the corner doubling down bricks to sell that track\nTrying to drive that dress LR\nOr laid back in back of that laid back\nYou know puffing on a Cuban cigar\nIn Brazil with Hype Williams watching the play back\nThis is living got to watch out for the driven\nThey'll kidnap your understanding and stab up your wisdom\nOne hit of that boy, boy, them niggas is schizing\nHog tie the family and blood bath the kitchen\nThis is a recipe to make niggas hate you\nFace on the Newsweek the actress want to date you\nIcecream boutique the Icecream skate shoe\nTwelve pages in the women's American Vogue\nChanel ceramic watches just share with your hoes\nGoyard trunks to travel there with your clothes\nThe engine just hums to send in the air and it goes\nLisa's in the lavatory she's puffing kush\nSara's on my lap with her head humming push\nShrimp and French fries right before I land\nYou take the ketchup and tell me where I am\nGreen Lantern it's your motherfucking man\nSkateboard yessir"

   "lyrics": "Preface\n\nIn this conversation, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams candidly explore the rewards and perils of a lifelong, perfectionist ethic. Best likened to a child's insatiable curiosity, they impute their compulsive, insistent tinkering to much lived experience, and even to obscure neurological phenomena. Their exchange lends precious \u2013 and comic \u2013 insight into a frightening capacity for invention, and a knowing approach to craft that is at once sure and relentlessly self-critical. They spoke in the wake of a minor controversy that followed the online launch of the single \u201cTheraflu\u201d, which Kanye released through his G.O.O.D Music label (in collaboration with DJ Khaled, DJ Pharris and the producer Hit Boy). Predictably, the pharmaceutical combine Novartis objected to the title. The track also featured the lyric \u201csomeone tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor,\u201d which drew immediate fire from the animal-rights group\n\nKanye West: Yo yo, what\u2019s good?!\n\nPharrell Williams: What up, killer?!\n\nKW: Shit, chillin\u2019, vibin\u2019 about changing the name of that song and trying to figure out what the name of the song should be. You know, the \u201cTheraflu\u201d song?\n\nPW: Yeah\n\nKW: Yeah, we\u2019re about to give it a new name\n\nPW: It\u2019s getting that big \u2013 they\u2019re going that crazy about it?\n\nKW: Oh, yeah they have an issue. Just the title and here\u2019s still a window of opportunity for us to change it. \u201cOh, well, I don\u2019t want to call it \u2018Theraflu\u2019. I\u2019m calling the song this\u2026\u201d And then people are like, \u201coh, he changed the song to this\u201d, and then that\u2019s what it is, because when I did the song, I actually did not know that it would get to the point that grandmothers are talking about it, you know? Like why did I give them that level of promotion?\n\nPW: Yeah, trust me, they\u2019re thankful. No matter what, they\u2019re thankful. This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk to you about. Which is what is it like to be \u2013 and I know how I feel about it \u2013 but you\u2019re definitely one of my peers, and one that I look at and say \u201cHe gets it, but I\u2019d love to hear his take on why we aspire to be.\u201d It\u2019s almost a disease to be a perfectionist. Nothing is ever quite good enough. What is it like to look at things and say to yourself, \u201cI know that they don\u2019t get it but maybe one day they will.\u201d\n\nKW: It is so funny this is such an example of being a perfectionist, right? This song is out and I\u2019m going to change the name, like I want to perfect this moment some more. Well, I think it\u2019s just if you\u2019re a perfectionist, that\u2019s just what you do. You know, there are slackers there are people who are satisfied by delivering everything they have \u2013 with their knowledge, their financial situation, their level of exposure \u2013 to deliver the best product possible. I respect, look up to, and look to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs who dedicated their time, soul and energy to delivering the best product that they knew they could. There\u2019s a lot of psychology that goes into it. What can you give to human existence? How can you push the culture forward? And when you\u2019re a perfectionist, at a certain point you feel a responsibility in what you put out, and what could trickle down from it. If you put out things that are so over-the-top and magnificent, what trickles down from it could at least be good because there are more followers than there are leaders\n\nPW: Yeah I agree\u2026You know what the funny thing is that we\u2019ve never done it on a Kanye West album, it might be time for that\n\nKW: Yeah!\n\nPW: It might be time for that\n\nKW: Yeah, we started on that shit for [Watch] The Throne\n\nPW: Oh yeah! That was a very serious moment\u2026\n\nKW: Yes!\n\nPW: I\u2019ll never forget going to you and Jay\u2019s show, and just seeing those laser lights. You addressed all the sensations, with the exception of smell and taste, I guess. Anything that you could control, the auditory and the visual, you curated \u2013 you made sure that it was a curated moment. And I\u2019ll never forget when the first bars of \u201cGotta Have It\u201d started playing, that minor chord. It just hits you anyway but it was just y\u2019all talking on top of the track as it starts to come on, and the crowd start going nuts! And it\u2019s really because at the end of the day, as great as the track is as it is and as great as all of the stuff you guys did on top of it, it was how the moment was so set up. It was like an incredible layup, an alley-oop. Do people even say that word anymore, alley-oop?\n\nKW: Yeah, it\u2019s only \u2018cause it happens\n\nPW: [laughs] yeah, you know I don\u2019t know anything about basketball, but it was an amazing set-up. That was crazy, just to see the reaction to what a visual and music could do together, and those people going absolutely crazy I was like \u201coh, ok, well done man, well done.\u201d\n\nKW: Yeah I definitely wanted to dial into that sound and mixing those textures together. I just want to dial into that more, I just want to set the note, like playing a few textures that I got for this new shit for the G.O.O.D. Music joint we opened up the album with this joint that me and Skrillex did together\n\nPW: Mmmmm. I like that!\n\nKW: Just like that!\n\nPW: Wow, I can\u2019t wait to hear what that sounds like. I know we are all shaped and moulded by all that we\u2019ve gone through, and by having spirituality \u2013 in whatever way you define it \u2013 it allows us to be bigger than our bodies, to be bigger than our essence. [But] there is something to be said for experience, being told \u201cno\u201d the entire time, when you wanted to get into an industry that you love. So let me ask you, how much has this experience contributed to who you became as a person?\n\nKW: Yeah, you know, I had to realize at what point to put off the real South Side Chicago mentality, that is what built me to deal with the amount of \u201cno\u2019s\u201d and deal with the amount of pressure and aggression, like I talked about on this Chicago song, \u201cmink is draggin\u2019 on the floor.\u201d That\u2019s one of my ideas for it [renaming \u2018Theraflu\u2019]. \u201cSwag King Cole, mink is dragin\u2019 on the floor, fo\u2019 I embarrass you, but I don\u2019t like to embarrass you\u2026\u2019I Don\u2019t Like To Embarrass You\u201d as the title\n\nPW: Anticipating PETA\n\nKW: Yeah, so\u2026when I say \u201cI\u2019m from where shorty\u2019s fucked up, double-cupped up. Might even kill some-body and YouTube it, so whoever thinks their words affect me is too stupid, and if you think you can do it better than me, then you do it.\u201d\n\nPW: Yeah, \u201cyou do it!\u201d\n\nPW: [laughs]\n\nKW: \u201cI\u2019m from Chicago.\u201d And that was just one of the best things to prepare me for anything. If you can make it out of Chicago, you can make it anywhere. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about on this new song, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about when I\u2019m dealing with any business or creative processes. That\u2019s the stuff I\u2019m talking about when I was dealing with people, from not wanting me to rap, to [not] doing the tour with Jay, and being able to do the light show for it It was like sit-ins, when we were going out to Paris. You know when we were wearing the outfits and people on the blogs were calling us names and all that, right? But then, once they got that Givenchy cover, and everybody\u2019s wearing Givenchy they\u2019re all like \u201coh this is cool.\u201d\n\nPW: Right\n\nKW: But it wasn\u2019t cool with South Park was using the photo and dissing us and everything. And so many people dress like that now\n\nPW: [Laughs in agreement] Yeah, that\u2019s what we do\n\nKW: That was before everybody said swag, or when we were out in Japan. How could you communicate through people? We\u2019re not even understanding the language but we knew the visual language, we knew the spirit, we knew the ideas, we knew the reference points\n\nPW: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing, man. That\u2019s what separates us from a lot of folk, and not because we\u2019re better but because we\u2019ve dedicated to listen to that inner voice, and a lot of people don\u2019t. A lot of people go \u201cman!\u201d they do something and they go \u201cshit you know what, and I\u2019m totally not da-da-da-da [fill in the blanks].\u201d People fail a lot of times doing that. Whereas we just trained ourselves to say \u201cyou know what, let me entertain this idea\u201d and exhaust all the possibilities to make sure that it doesn\u2019t make sense because something good may come out of that and for every time that someone has ever told you no, you\u2019ve always had that willingness to explore it. Um, and I\u2019ve watched that by the way, it\u2019s been cool to see. How are you enjoying that\u2026\n\nKW: - Enjoying what?\n\nPW: I\u2019m thinking of a way to put it\u2026How are you enjoying this whole fame thing?\n\nKW: [gasp] You know its just a process of separating things, it\u2019s understanding how to exploit it to display things, it\u2019s understanding how to exploit it to display amazing art. You know the whole trick is that I am a visual artist. To this day I can\u2019t play piano. I\u2019ve taken it up a couple of times and I forget how to play the piano. And when I first wanted to rap, before I rapped, the first thing I did was actually draw my tape covers because that\u2019s back when people had tapes. I drew the cover before I even thought about doing music. Let\u2019s put this information in Vegas to music. So ina  way I\u2019ll get the music but it was always about the fountain. It was always about the light show. It was always about the fashion show, it was always about that. Whether it is the font that we pick for a single cover, or a video \u2013 I\u2019m going to Qatar later tonight to shoot the film for \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d which is basically my second pop fairytale, like how \u201cRunaway\u201d was \u2013 it creates that kind of opportunity. When you see me design, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the best design or whatever, but you know, [in \u201cRunaway\u201d] I had my idea of how I wanted Selita [Ebanks] to look, and I wanted it to be Selita. I wanted to juxtapose minimalist, Vanessa Beecroft like high art against unrealistic Victoria Secret-level beauty.  They don\u2019t crash, those words are not in the same place. You\u2019ve been to art parties before? It\u2019s different from a Victoria Secret\u2019s party. You know what I\u2019m talking about!\n\nPW: Right!\n\nKW: That\u2019s right. Due to exposure, I\u2019m able to have these things be seen by so many people. If Matthew Barney were more famous, then more people would see what Matthew Barney did. So it\u2019s that. When it comes down to it, what I enjoy about it is the opportunity to express art in high volume, literally\n\nPW: Did you know that you\u2019re a synesthete? That you have synesthesia?\n\nKW: That\u2019s what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s what the film is about! You\u2019re talking about seeing sounds right?\n\nPW: There are many different forms of synesthesia. There are grapheme synethetes, people who see colors in numbers, letters in colours. But I believe most musicians and most artists are synesthetes\n\nKW: You know that\u2019s what this film in Qatar is about!\n\nPW: Oh wow!\n\nKW: It\u2019s called Cruel Summer: The Legend of the Lamborghini Dons  and it\u2019s basically the G.O.O.D Music Lamborghini Dons. [Kid] Cudi, he\u2019s the main character and I\u2019m just this boy, and in the beginning we\u2019re car thieves. There\u2019s this part where one character teaches another to see colours through sound\n\nPW: Oh wow!\n\nKW: Yeah, the shit is dope. Matter of fact, if we could do work with you on the soundtrack. I mean I\u2019ve got eight tracks for it, I just want to give it twelve. Basically it\u2019s the G.O.O.D Music soundtrack that \u201cMercy\u201d is the first single for. You\u2019re like next level with this type of shit like [sings] \u201cTake me far away, as long as it\u2019s fun, fun, fun, I wanna go.\u201d I\u2019m talking to actually a film scorer at this point so \u2013\n\nPW: No! But dude\u2026.Nah man! It\u2019s funny that you picked that out [\u201cFun, Fun Fun\u201d]. That\u2019s funny, wow!\n\nKW: I play that song real normal in the car\n\nPW: No way?!\n\nKW: Yeah!\n\nPW: That\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s crazy. \u2018Aight well say no more.

Never been a dealer\nNever glorified that, just the character it built\nThe game's real and you find out quick\nWhen you want the Bentley, the Porsche ain't shit\nNot a chain from Jacob, what I need is a wake up\nAnd this pain my heart got the weight of an anchor\nAnd still I thank the good Lord for health\nAnd the peace that you get when you right with yourself\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\n\"Come go with me\nI make you feel right\"\nThat's what the dope man used to say\nBringing cocaine in the jam\n\"Come go with me\nI'll make you feel right\"\nThat's what all the dope men say\nBringing cocaine in the jam"

I don't know, maybe\nand you already know I mean, and you know I mean no harm\nI'm not like these other guys, I'm a lil different\nand I'm desperately trying to get you to think about me as much as I think about you , I just want you to notice me\nI have no problem admitting that not even Marilyn Monroe\nWho Cleopatra? Not even Joan of Ark, that don't mean nothing to me\nI just want a different girl, and that's you\n\nLove Pharrell"

You talkin' to me?\nYou gon' do what? Yes he's got the gat and he can pull two-up\nThem shits is mind-blowing\nWhere he grew up they wear rags with they eyes showin'\nFour in the morning you hear the nines blowin'\nArmour all on they cars to keep the shine goin'\nWe order cars with special features\nThe two-tone rose the bitch got alopecia\nWho got vitiligo, intended color cycle\nWhite and tan and brown, call it Michael\nI just might go down to the beach\nAbsorb the heat pick up a couple freaks\nEyes lead them between my sheets\nThen eyes lead them right beneath\nDownstairs right in the lobby\nI'm not being cocky\nBut snugglin' is Lnot me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nKilos, C-notes, speedboats pe coastal\nSee low we smoke chocha tre ochos\nThat's what eighty-five percent of niggas envision\nWhile the real ten percent get caught and go to prison\nThe other five percent them niggas end up missing\nProbably on the coastal bellies deep sea fishing\nBlowin' perfect rings out the Cuban cigar\nTheir daughters turn 16 get 'em Italian cars\nThe world is yours fuck it how 'bout Mars?\nI know your mother told ya \"Aim for the stars\"\nLet's get right nigga cut short the laugh and\nGet in touch with high B with the half hand\nThe dope is opium comes from Afghan\nSo let's make millions and blow up like a gas can\nYou wanna shine don't you? Like the rocks glisten\nBut you ain't tryna listen, you on a fuckin' mission\n\n[Hook]"

Like... just shit, like, you know? And just wave his fingers around the world and call us \"crumbs\" and shit\nI was hurt, stunned, astounded, amazed, and dazed, and confused as a child when the nigga did the \"Young World\" video, the \"Hey Young World\" shit. That shit changed my life. So, you know, when you see me rolling around here, you know, looking like Slick Rick, you know where the fuck it's coming from. You know what I'm saying?\nSo, for me, I wanted to, you know\u2014I wanted to have a conversation to all my fans, you know what I'm saying, that's on the water in the hood, doing what they do, on that grind every day, 'cause I know that\u2014I know what that is, you know what I'm saying? (Uh-huh) And who's the grimiest nigga in the street?  (Uh-huh) You know what I mean? (Uh-huh) DJ Drama (Ill!)\nAnd especial\u2014I mean, it's my first mixtape and shit, know what I mean? There's more to come, so, we 'gon do what it is we gotta do."

Said yes, I said chill\nI don't touch white lines, not even parking my wheels\nBitch you plastic your girls is plastic\nAin't it hot out here? The sun don't melt yall asses?\nThe place you bought your nose, they showed you a book right?\nBut when you have a baby what the fuck it gon look like?\nMan, lemme go upstairs to my room\n\n[Chorus: Chaster French]\nLife in L.A. is so insane\nEveryday feels the same\nSpent all my cash, I'm down to change\nIts time to move away\n\n[Verse 2: Jarmaine Dupri]\nSkateboard, I hear what you sayin man\nIts kinda hard not to get caught up\nLotta fly shit to be bought up\nAnd the ladies act crazy\nCause thats just the way they brought up\nWhat they parents did, passes to the kid\nAnd so on and so on\nAnd shit, if they rich? then they really gone\nI met this bad lil bitch up in Paris' house\nTalkin right, like she bout to let a nigga wear it out\nSmack her on the ass, talk shit, pull her hair out\nI knew it wasn't real but shit, you think I care about that?\nI was on her she was lower than Velona from Good Times\nMixed, I was workin tryna show her a good time\nAnd thats when she asked me had I ever did the nasty\nWith a girl that had fake tits, hips, and a ass G\nI was stone faced, nigga had a long face\nAll fucked up, like whats goin on face\nI'm like for real are you tellin me the truth bitch?\nShe like hell yeah nigga, this that new shit\n\n[Chorus: Chaster French]\nLife in L.A. is so insane\nEveryday feels the same\nSpent all my cash, I'm down to change\nIts time to move away"

I would never allow it\nSpit that shit to me, I would ask you, \"Have you showered?\"\nYou wanna get up in my boat and ride\nTake pictures with the kid up in Ocean Drive\nGo to Casa Tua and just sip on Calouas\nAt the bar, talkin' to other women about the best jewelers\nYou like that, huh? Smilin' still, call your girlfriend (Why?)\nYou fell asleep at the wheel\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nAnd don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit\nTryna ask me shit, c'mon\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyo, I walk in brashest, certainly the crassest\nThe restaurant's classes, the owner is asses\nShit, my money green like the helmet of a fascist\nSo what you want \u2013 Patron or Petrucia glasses?\nAin't no mystery, his daughter know the history\nAnd every night we toast like it's victory, get with me\nAnd I ain't changed since my early mental\nI been snackin' on shrimp and sippin' on Shirley Temples\nNo drug to drinkin' \u2013 what you want?\nNo, seriously, what you thinkin'? Since the Yukon\nNever puffed a J, you can ask Loushawn\nBack when he pushed beige like it was coupons\nWith a house full of dames like it was Moulin\nI would ask they names, but they would only do Sean\nAnd I ain't sayin they regret it, but fuck it, they do\n'Cause if they could reverse time, nigga\nWhat would they do, huh?\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nAnd don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit\nTryna ask me shit, c'mon\n\n[Verse 3]\nHoneys Panamanian, eyes like Iranian\nLighter than the blue of the sky of the day we in\nAss like a volleyball, the kind that make your dick hard\nHead to the hustlers, so sweet she could get cars\nNow she here with me, lil' Skateboard P\nCheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps\nI spit, then I hit, then I murk, yessir\nA flick chico stick and a Twix, that's her\nShe admire how the champion live\nHow I signed Slim Thug with a ramp in my crib\nI'm a champion, I do as the champions did\nExcept I improve with the new and the rest get rid\nBut some of y'all don't like that, it's easy tryna bite back\nInstead of sayin' hi, gettin' fly, but I'll be right back\nMy dude got the steel if you think you fly\nShoot the wings off your ego and watch you skydive, yessir\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nDon't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit\nAnd don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit\nTryna ask me shit, c'mon"
