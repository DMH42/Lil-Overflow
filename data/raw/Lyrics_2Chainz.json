And here you are, a black unicorn\nMythical, mystical, since the day that you were born\nMastered all the madness, let the magic have his way\nLet the power paint the day, let the god have his say\nCause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed\nSitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down\nJust glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found\nThen know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nFree at last, free at last\nThat's what I said when I got out my last deal\nSome people can't relate\nSleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit\nAnd when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust\nTurn on your faucet\nDrip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments\nAnd everything is a obstacle\nWhen they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital\nNow they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere\nI rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years\nYeah, and that's my car talking\nOld school running with the dogs barking\nHop out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins\nWeed so strong, I be seldom coughing\nAnd I'm covered in Balmain\nInstagram pics of my lobster omelette\nSelling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade\nNow I got more nines than the fourth grade\n\n[Hook: Chrisette Michele]\nFreedom, it's all I really want\nIt's all I really want to be\nIt's all I really need\nI want, I want and I believe\nYou thought you had the best of me\nBut now I'm what you need\n\n[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]\nHear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me\nCompetition best to fear me\nLyrically I could be Talib Kweli\nBut with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe\nI leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve\nI practiced repetition, I need 100 G's\n100 M's, hug and squeeze, Dad kept this in the dungarees\nI'm not a rat but I love the cheese\nI change hoes like I change gears\nAnd my yard so big I got pet deers\nAnd my homies try to act like I ain't real\nI put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals\nYou need a focus group, my group focused\nHit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus\nI'm the dopest, you can quote this\nUnderscore, it's just me and dope\nDirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap\nI done seen them rich, I done seen them broke\nI done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke\nWhen the baby come out, he gon' be geeked\nYou never know, he might come out to feed me\n\n[Hook: Chrisette Michele]\nFreedom, it's all I really want\nIt's all I really want to be\nIt's all I really need\nI want, I want and I believe\nYou thought you had the best of me\nBut now I'm what you need"

You shu-shu-shut. Shut your mouth\n- I needed someone to move the--\n- Wait, shut your mouth. Shu-shut your--shut your mouth\n- I'm sorry. What did you just say?\n- You're just coming off stupid\n- I'm coming off as stupid? You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms. Please leave this office, we're done with this interview\n- Do we get any sort of souvenir?\n- GET OUT OF MY OFFICE!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI want my trap back, I said I want my trap back\nThey sayin' that money talk, nigga\nSo you already know that I want my cash back\nYou niggas ain't talking about shit, Harley Levin\nYou would've thought that there was some\nKilos on my bus but they didn't find a thing\nHair, man, like Brillo, my flow Armadillo\nCatch me first class on Delta with Versace all in my pillow\nI been seen a kilo, the dope man my hero\nRemember I had that Box Chevy? I set that bitch on some P zeros\nYou know that I'm rocking Buscemis, and I'm as raw as sashimi\nHer head is so cold, my nigga, I think that she gon' need a beanie\nRolling and smoking zucchini, dropping the top on the whips\nMaking them look like bikinis\nI am now balling so hard, I should be on my own boxes of Wheaties, ugh"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Louis Farrakhan & Monica]\nAs I met 2 Chainz a few minutes ago, as I gazed into his face, I felt that I was in the presence of royalty. There's a certain power presence that he gives off\nI tried to be, everything you want and need\n\n[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]\n'Cause you got a deep title don't mean that you deep\nSubstance shallow on shit creek, I heard Cole speak\nAbout the bricks, Kendrick got Compton lit\nAnd I've been lit ever since I sold nicks\nNever fabricated about my fabric, the scale, that's my apparatus\nI give a fuck about the sorriest rappers\nThis actually happened, path in the back pathogenic\nMoved that blow out like we were afrocentric\nI had a front row entry, I had the codeine kidney\nI made up the Bentiaga truck, you owe me a Bentley\nThis the rap Ken Griffey, got at least 10 with me\nGot at least 10 on me, I'm anti-phony\nMy girl anti-bony and she get that money\nI bought all this shit, don't go acting anti on me\nIt's Mr. Epps in the bank, I give a F what you think\nI bought a Tesla today, there's nothing left in your tank\nI did everything except a fucking song with Jay\nBut I murdered every song I fucking did with Ye\nSee my verses are better and my subject is realer\nSee my mom was an addict and my dad was the dealer\nAnd their son is that nigga, I'm no Black activist\nI'm a Black millionaire, give you my Black ass to kiss\nWe used the tree for a fence, I used to land in the trench\nUsed to dust myself off, then I eat me some shrimp\nCoulda did anything, I coulda been me a pimp\nI coulda went to the league, I took it straight to the rim\nI took it straight to the block, I got Xans in my sock\nI got plans for the pot, I got bands, you do not, huh\n\n[Interlude: 2 Chainz]\nYeah, you a miracle. Right now, if you hear this, you're a miracle, I want you to know that. If you're able to hear this right now, you are a miracle. Straight up, no kapp\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nI'm more Gucci than Vans, give you a Gucci advance\nThis the chance of your life, you ain't prepared for your life\nSee the man without a mic is just a mic gimmick\nAnyone, Jordan, Jackson, Tyson, Bivens\nPhone number unlisted\nGave her the digits to a number that is long distance\nShe on the wrong mission and got my palm itching\nI had it on me, you can see it in my prom pictures, ugh\n\n[Interlude: 2 Chainz]\nI'm telling you, niggas like me fall out the sky. You don't just bump into me. I'm a real blessing, bro, nah, for real, bro\n\n[Chorus: 2 Chainz]\nYou know the times is rough, you know the times is hard\nI never trust my neighbors, so we got burglar bars\nYou know the times is rough you know the times is hard\nI never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, yeah, okay\nYou know the times is rough you know the times is hard\nI never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars\nYou know the times is rough you know the times is hard\nI never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, Lord\n\n[Bridge: Monica]\nLord knows\nWoke up today, gave thanks\nGrateful to see another day, then the storm came\nAs the night falls, I shed my blood, sweat and tears\nLet the rain fall, let it fall, let it fall\nOne day\nYour love will take me right over the stars, Lord knows\n\n[Outro: 2 Chainz]\nThat soulful trap music, man. Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Section 8, I'm talkin' 'bout the 'partments. You stay in the middle, someone stay on top of you, someone stay below you. What you know about grabbing a broom and shit and hitting upstairs like, \"Y'all stop fucking stomping! Y'all stop walking so mothafuckin' hard!\" Then the people downstairs, they doing the same shit to us. Tru, trill shit"

All because of one thing: freebasing cocaine. That's all my life was, was basing, nothing else. I was on that last lap, with that checker flag about to wave me on into hell\n\nBut I got lucky, I got into rehab program down der in Redstone Arsenal down der in Alabama and with dem people helpin' me. Well that smoking white devil is no longer a part of my life.  I can proudly say, that white devil is no longer a part of my life and I can proudly say, that today, I do not freebase cocaine\n\nNow I'll take a drink, now. I will take a drink but I do not freebase cocaine. You know, well, I take a drink and I might even smoke a little reefer. You know, you know I like to smoke reefer. You know, it relaxes me and everything. A couple doobies, you know, just ta get you through the day and everything. But, far as basin goes, I don't do it\n\nNow I'll do some toot now. Don't get me wrong. I will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything, and somebody comes up and gives it to you, its impolite not to take it there. So me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you. We do party. You know, I will do some toot. We'll do, you know, on a good weekend there we call a bunch of friend over we'll do bout an eight ball of toot there but we don't base. I do not freebase cocaine. I want to make that clear. I don't do it"

Then it's cool\nWetness all around me like a pool\nYou say who?\nI say me, she say we\nShe a selfish little freak: every time she nut she try to go to sleep\nI go deep, she go \"hee!\"\nWhen she really say \"hee!\" she say \"T!\"\nShe don't like to call me Tity, she no me from back in the G\nI'm a beast, I'm a dog, shit I'm hanging from the tree\nYeah, we doing all that monkey shit, that sucking and that fucking shit\nAnd if I had another pick, I would pick the other bitch\nCause she more like the way I like em, and this one right here ain't shit\nThis one might need a quilt, it's cold on the other side\nHer head so fire, I hated for them other guys\nPimpin and I'm mackin'\nActin in the 'lac' and\nIf you out chea working, you ain't worth Curtis Jackson\nAnd she cost a hunnid, for some satisfaction\nAnd I'm just relaxing\n\n[Sample]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeaaaaaaaaah. I got a Chevelle with a Corvette engine\nChampagne, bubble bath, Moet swimming\nShe said, \"I don't know what done got into me.\"\nAnd I said, \"it was me when you was on liquor\"\nYeaaah. Blame it on the alcohol. If you don't remember that, battin' your Nigeria Falls\nAnd when I pull em, all I have to do is call:\nI say come 'ere, and it's a lake in they fucking draws\nAnd you late! Faking like a fucking broad\nHair hang like a London fall, just becau'\nAnd the wind blow, I'm hanging out the window\nWindtows, pistols, and all common essentials\nIf a nigga talking math, he talking my lingo\nAnd if I say I'm popping tags, I'm talking my Benzo\nI'm fresh off the lot, fresh off the block\nWhat?\n\n[Sample]"

Aflac\nAnd we getting paper baby can I get a hand-clap\nClap-clap-clap-clap-clap now I been booming out my traphouse\nNigga try to go and we gon' have to pull them thangs out\n'Cuz I got them chains out, them charms and them rings out\nAnd if you been hustling, then we took the same route\n\n[Hook]\nWe gon' get it in, we gon' get it in\nStarted wit' a model, then I fucked her friend\nThen I bought a condo, then I bought a Benz\nBallin' outta control we gon' get it in\nWe gon' get it in, we gon' get it in\nStarted wit' a model, then I fucked her friend\nThen I bought a condo, then I bought a Benz\nBallin' outta control we gon' get it in\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst I bought a Beamer, then I bought some rims\nThen I fucked a model, then I fucked her twin\nSee I don't give a fuck, we don't fuck wit' them\nI'm yelling fuck the other side, we gon' get it in!\nTalking on my iPhone wit' that shuffle on my iPod\nAlligator belts when I flow no Izod\nWalking wit' my chopper, I might need a tripod\nMake ya dog look backwards nigga... my God\nAnd know that I hustle all day\nAnd hang on the west like Kanye\nAnd I got techs like Georg-a, in my yellow jacket\nBitch don't act right I get her a yellow taxi\nNiggas know what happen when you fucking wit' the captain\nNiggas know I'm sushi, I'm raw, what's happening\nSmoking on that cannabis, drinking on that lavender\nAnd I'm getting to it every day that's on the calendar\n\n[Hook]\nWe gon' get it in, we gon' get it in\nStarted wit' a model, then I fucked her friend\nThen I bought a condo, then I bought a Benz\nBallin' outta control we gon' get it in\nWe gon' get it in, we gon' get it in\nStarted wit' a model, then I fucked her friend\nThen I bought a condo, then I bought a Benz\nBallin' outta control we gon' get it in"

Hello, Hello, where you at?\nI need more, then say less, uh\nThe mink I got, pet detective mad 'bout this shit\nGotta brag 'bout this shit\n'Cause me and mama had a sofa that we had to split\nBefore I left, I heard Banks say, \"Pass the stick\"\nNow if we talkin' magazines, It's a lot of issues\nBut if you see it in black and white, it is so official\nAnd the bro sent me a gift, along with a scripture\nIt said, \"When you shoot your shot, make sure you're the pistol\" (Bow!)\n\n[Chorus]\nGod keep on blessin' me, I'm doin' somethin' right\nGod keep on blessin' me, I'm doin' somethin' right\nGod keep on blessin' me, I'm doin' somethin' right\nMy neighbor that stay next to me wanna go to war at night\nSomebody broke into his spot, he thought it was my guys\nHe tried to call us a gang, 'cause we were organized\nShawty fire, she the flame, pretty brown eyes\nSomethin' wrong, I had missed calls, 55 times"

Play \"Where U Been?\" featuring Cap.1 and crank up the 2 Chainz dance\n2. Drizzle olive oil on the most expensive rack of lamb in the store\n3. Sprinkle assorted seasonings (Lawry's black pepper, onion, garlic) onto lamb and mix well with chopped herbs\n4. With the song bumping in the background, cover the expensive lamb in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes\n5. Place chops onto lightly oiled, hot, oven-safe pan\n6. Cook over medium-high heat for approximately 2 to 2 1/2 minutes per side\n7. Finish cooking in 350F oven for roughly 10 minutes or until desired doneness\n8. Once finished, plate racks of lamb alongside a bottle of extravagantly priced cabernet. 2 Chainz and fine wine. You want true? That's true enough\n\nBeer-Steamed Snow Crab Legs\n\n\u2022 2 pounds snow crab legs\n\u2022 22 ounces cheap beer\n\u2022 1 lemon\n\u2022 1/2 stick butter\n\u2022 Olive oil\n\u2022 Old Bay Seasoning\n\u2022 Garlic powder\n\n1. Turn the lights down and light some candles\n2. Set the mood by playing \"So We Can Live\"\n3. Once the vibe is right, add snow crab legs to large stock pot\n4. Pour the cheapest beer in the supermarket over the crab legs\n5. Add juice of 1 lemon and put lemon in pot when finished\n6. Season with Old Bay and garlic powder\n7. Bring the pot to a boil and cover if possible\n8. Let crab legs steam for 6 minutes\n9. Light some more candles and meditate. The vibe is so important to this dish that it is worth spending extra time to get it just right\n10. Turn legs, then steam for an additional 5 minutes\n11. Serve with melted butter and/or \"Me Time\" Sauce"

Don't get me wrong\nI will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything\nAnd somebody comes up and gives it to you\nIts impolite not to take it there\nSo me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you\nWe do party. You know, I will do some toot\nWe'll do, you know\nOn a good weekend there we call a bunch of friend over\nWe'll do bout an eight ball of toot there but we don't base\nI do not freebase cocaine.

   "lyrics": "Every evening you will find him\nAround our neighborhood\nIt's the old dope peddler\nThat we know by doing good\n\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nI said I pull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nI said I pull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\n\nMost of my niggas got gold teeth\nMost of my bitches got tattoos\nMost of my niggas think cash rules\nAnd I mess up hair dos like it's a pair of shoes\nAnd I need a parachute when I'm up there\nI'm in the trap cuz I work there\n\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nI said I pull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nI said I pull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\n\nWhen the shades of night are falling\nComes a fellow everyone knows\nIt's the old dope peddler\nSpreading joy wherever he goes\n\nSee what these bitches looking like\nStick it in all crooked like\nLouie V is my kyrptonite\nTake ya bitch and I give her back\nGive her this and I give her that\nFine wine and lobster tail\nCandlelight and Chrisette Michele\nLook at the pussy and play kiss and tell\nFix her hair then fix her nails\nEven pay a few bills\nWay I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal\nAnd my whole crew ill\nPockets on fat burger\nGoing so hard you'd think I mixed the Viagra with the Soda\nStaying focused\nBlack and white ice, polar bear\nYou hold her hand and I hold her hair\nI pull her close and I put it there\n\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nI said I pull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\nI said I pull up to that club like\nMothafucka ho you don't know me\n\nWhen the shades of night are falling\nComes a fellow everyone knows\nIt's the old dope peddler\nSpreading joy wherever he goes"

I'm the Lieutenant, this for real niggas only\nWe real over here, them other niggas phony\nFuck my opponent\nIt's me against the world, keep a toolie by my stomach\nFruity ones on, blunt in my hand\nAnd if I front you work you gotta pay Uncle Sam, you understand? (King Shit)\nMan, text me\n\n[Verse 2]\nRay, what's up?\nWeezy, what's happnin'?\n62 Hard, from the rags to the riches\nWen't in on the nine, and started fuckin' battle bitches\nSouth side, FYI\nTill I D - I - E , nigga I'm so high, nigga I'm so fly\nI might be, somewhere in the sky\nI just need the wings\nLook at my jeans!\nDamn! They ripped!\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee I'm a General, salute me\nBossy, lousy, socks Coogi\nOpportunity knockin, I'd rather kick the door down and wave around a choppa, and lick off a couple of shots\nShots to us going down\nDon't make me cause a drought on yo' side of town\nAnd yeah it's a war if you can't sleep\nAnd they ain't servin' niggas, so you can't eat\nNigga you ain't me!\nI'm in the belly of the beast for weeks!\nNiggas got rich now they barely speak\nI hope you feel it in your heart\nIt's comin' from my heart\nI've been hard from the start, in the slums of College Park\nIt was hurled at your heart\nShots, new recordings\nRemember, we used to think going to sleep was boring (King Shit)\n\n[Outro]"
