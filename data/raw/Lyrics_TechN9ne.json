   "lyrics": "[Produced by Seven]\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI get to bustin' like I'm a thirty ought six\nWhen I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed\nWhen I got at the top and they made him purty hot (Uh)\n'Cause he knowin' that Tecca Nina's a dirty chopper (Uh)\nHe's handle, holmes, here's a handful\nHow in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though?\nI said to Seven, \"Richie Havens'll be the man\"\nSo we put it together thinkin' Eminem was a gamble (uh)\nGuess not, 'cause he be the guest spot\nKaliko said, \"What we doin'?\" \u2013 I said to him, \"Let's chop!\"\nSo now the people finally get three of the best locked (Uh)\nNever be another chopper's comin' so let's rock, nigga! (Uh)\nYou're on, people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song\nYes, I got another killer makin' a tour strong\nIf you thinkin' of battlin'\u2014uh, you're gone!\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nNobody can catch him, he the Speedy Gonzales\nThe beat is a problem\nAnd if you got your feet in your mouth\nYou gon' have to beat it up out of him\nIt's a lot of 'em, and I mean a lot of 'em\nAnd me and Nina used to follow them\nI've got to audibly body them\nThis is it, man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em\nAnd if fans will lift hands, we'll get dancin' out of 'em\nAnd in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em\nWho stands with two hands up movin' the crowd of 'em\nIf I ain't makin' sense\nThen you better sample the amp of it like the bass\nIt ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em\nI beat 'em, I burn 'em (Then I let 'em melt)\nThey never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up (Uh)\nI slap the shirt off a super simpleton, make 'em be impotent\nIf and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine (Okay)\nI said the purpose to pimp a pen\nAnd reverse the conditions I'm livin' in\nAnd do bigger numbers than Eminem\nGotta be fast, or I'll smash on a nigga\nWith half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure\n(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter\nIf you half-ass deliverin' I'ma eat your dinner (Yum)\nBetter than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys (Okay)\nI jump around, so do that mean that I'm rubberized? (Okay)\nMe and N9ne master, meaning we murderize\nWe'll bleed 'em, beat 'em 'til they be gone, feed 'em!\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nSpeedom! (If you wanna go with us)\nSpeedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)\nSpeedom! (I must be the one to bust)\nSpeedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)\nSpeedom! (If you wanna go with us)\nSpeedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)\nSpeedom! (I must be the one to bust)\nSpeedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nSometimes (go) I feel (go)\nLike I'll never slow down\n(Worldwide Choppers)\nSometimes (go) I feel (go)\nLike I'll never slow down\n(Worldwide Choppers)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nWait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see\nIf Stephanie Mills left any extra refills\nOf ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled\nOr she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink (You inspect the sink?)\nIn the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in Vics\nBut I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after tonight\nI'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet\n'Cause that's what it's like, and attackin' it like a Dracula bite\nJetpack in a backpack when I write\nAll this anger pent-up inside\nI went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter\nFigured I'd try to set a big enough fire\nThat'll trigger the sprinkler system\nAnd I'd escape, but the getaway driver\nScrewed up my limo, collided with the center divider\nI went through the window\nAnd ended up being pinned to the side\nOf a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda\nThe flight attendant from Idaho\nThat took an antenna in the vagina hole\n'Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous\nAnd I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace\nLike an evil dental hygienist, sinister\nYou've been yellin' dementedness\nI invented this, I'm the genesis\nEminem is a nemesis to a feminist\nFuckin' smart alec degenerate, I got Ellen DeGeneres\nTryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious\nOf female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss\nYou will never consider this a bitter disappointment\nI'll never fail to deliver this\nWhatever the weather in this'll be\nJust like a certificate of authenticity that I'm thinkin' about\nJust tryna think of the quickest and sickest way\nTo make 'em picket, I pick a day to be a prick\nThen I'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say\nSpit it back on a level, incredible\nHead full of Red Bull, unforgettable\nBetter believe these beats are edible\nI consider loose leaf a vegetable\nAnd I stalk my prey\nYou think you got away? Uh-uh, not today\nMurder you on a song and then I'll just say\nI was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake, eatin' lobster, steak\nAnd coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake\nAnd Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate\nI'm a lot to take, like Kanye walkin' up on the stage\nFor Beyonc\u00e9, like it's my job to say\nThat you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation\nHonest Abe is on his way, you will not escape\nAmmunition replenished, the Punisher\nWith his gun insured, hundred words\nIn a clip, other words motherfuckers better run\nIf you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner\nNo wonder no one don't wanna go\nAnd jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive\nOr get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nSpeedom! (If you wanna go with us)\nSpeedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)\nSpeedom! (I must be the one to bust)\nSpeedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)\nSpeedom! (If you wanna go with us)\nSpeedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)\nSpeedom! (I must be the one to bust)\nSpeedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nSometimes (go) I feel (go)\nLike I'll never slow down\n(Worldwide Choppers)\nSometimes (go) I feel (go)\nLike I'll never slow down\n(Worldwide Choppers)\n\n[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]\nI'm the fury, the final fight\nI flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright\nI flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight\nFeminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife\nNever forget it, I severed the head of a critic\nI sped up and did it, you trippin' to be a dead epidemic\nOr wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage\nOf an addict who's havin' to get the lead of a cynic\nI was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry\nPeddle the metal, we givin' the light, a lot of energy\nWe reppin', beat checkin' he that be Koba\nIf he's the evil enemy it'll be over\nRunning you down, in front of your town\nYou ever makin' fun of the clown, I'm gunnin' you down\nWe doin' it under the ground, a wonderful sound\nIf anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch!\nWould never be choppin' without Slick Rick\nI got it from the record \"Lick the Balls\" and this dick\nIf you never listen to me, you musical misfit\nNah, 'cause every time I be droppin' I get bit\nI'm hearin' a lot of rappers, they tryin' to spit quick\nBut the Middle West got 'em and we kill 'em in this bitch\nIf you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it\n'Cause me and my nigga Twista rule it\u2014and this it\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nSpeedom! (If you wanna go with us)\nSpeedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)\nSpeedom! (I must be the one to bust)\nSpeedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)\nSpeedom! (If you wanna go with us)\nSpeedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)\nSpeedom! (I must be the one to bust)\nSpeedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nSometimes (go) I feel (go)\nLike I'll never slow down\n(Worldwide Choppers)\nSometimes (go) I feel (go)\nLike I'll never slow down\n(Worldwide Choppers)"

I like you, but you\u2019re crazy\nMy tours paid me, so I used that dough to allure ladies\nTo manure bathe me\nNever that, my mind's for sure shady\nPure Hades, Rev X said that he couldn\u2019t endure to save me\nWhy do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row?\nWhen I felt that burn, I palm the clitoris, I'ma get her wet\nSorry to get carried away\nI feel stupid 'cause I ain\u2019t did her yet\nMaybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts\nI get vexed so N9ne bit her neck\nOpen! I try to contain it, but that dame thang\u2019s soakin'\nAlter ego say: \"Why you let them gangbang folk in?\"\nStrange Lane hopin' I can maintain copin'\nBut ain\u2019t nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken\nI like fire on my skin, blood on my draws\nFrom up on her walls, I\u2019m sufferin', I\u2019m stuck in her claws\nStuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin', hollerin', I'm a dog\nAfterwards I like really hot scaldin' water on my balls\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne, Hopsin & B.o.B]\nAm I a psycho?\nAm I a psycho?\nYeah, I\u2019m a psycho\nI guess I\u2019m a psycho\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nMom? Dad? I\u2019m no longer the boy you're used to seein'\nI\u2019ve changed a lot, plus I\u2019ve grown to hate every human bein'\nMy mood swings have now turned\nMy dreams into gruesome scenes\nNow I\u2019m doin' things I don\u2019t normally do when illusion seem\nTo be the only pleasures I can gain\nHeck, if I was sane I would've put down the mic\nAnd said, \"Fuck it, I'll never rise to fame.\"\nBut with the wicked wreckage I contain\nI could probably jeopardize your name\nNo lovey-dovey, let\u2019s ignite the flame\nIf you\u2019re lucky you'll survive the pain\nSorry, that ain't very merry to say\nWhy is this game so scary to play?\nWell, let me think, 'cause every day\nMy balls are gettin' too hairy to shave\nPause a minute, I'm stressin' again\nIf I go to Hell, then Heaven's to blame\nI don\u2019t mean to come off crazy\nBut you mothafuckas seem to think I\u2019m hella deranged\nWhen I was seven years old\nI fell on my head and I severed my brain\nYou think I\u2019m lyin'? Then ask my mama\nNigga, she'll go tell you the same\u2014\nShould I be ashamed? No\nI\u2019m livin' my life so ghetto fabulous\nBefore you get bent out of shape\nMy nigga, let me ask you this\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne, Hopsin & B.o.B]\nAm I a psycho?\nAm I a psycho?\nYeah, I\u2019m a psycho\nI guess I\u2019m a psycho\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B]\nI stab you with this mic, and rap this verse I'm rappin' to you\nMatter of fact, I\u2019m rappin' through you\nNever say my motherfuckin' name\nUnless you absolutely have to\nI am not no fuckin' jacket with no matchin' shoes\nAnd you are not no fashion guru\nCan\u2019t even see you niggas, y'all wish I was rappin' to you\nMatter of fact, act like I'm rappin' to you\nIf that gives you passion to use this as an excuse\nThen just jump up out of conclusion\nThat I'm attackin' you dudes; it's just like old-fashion voodoo\nY'all ain\u2019t even the shit, no, y'all ain\u2019t even the doodoo\nI got more flavor on the tissue paper under my two boots\nSo I\u2019m slappin' you fools with wooden paddles, you stupid\nBabysittin' little bastards like little afternoon children\nYou can call me psychotic, but it\u2019s more like schizophrenic\nAnd I can't sleep, can anyone tell me\nJust where my medicine is?\nGuess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is\nMan, I swear I'm all about my brain like graduate students\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings\nI see your tears, come here, give me your face, let me clear it\nBut I wonder how it would look\nIf I were to peel it back with a skillet\nThen I'ma feel it crack when I hit it\nThen I'ma split it back when you heal it\nDamn it, Bobby boy! What in the hell?\nWhat in the heaven? What in the Earth?\nWhere is your mom? What are you, cursed?\nWhere are you from? Where was your birth?\nWhere was you first? Why weren\u2019t you in church?\nWhy is there dirt all on your shirt?\nMan, I think that you\u2019re goin' berserk\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne, Hopsin & B.o.B]\nAm I a psycho?\nAm I a psycho?\nYeah, I\u2019m a psycho\nI guess I\u2019m a psycho\nAm I a psycho?\nAm I a psycho?\nYeah, I\u2019m a psycho\nI guess I\u2019m a psycho"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nWanna sit beside a sick and seductive sinner, see\nSomething so sinister seeking sookie somethin' like a centipede\nSlitherin', she's searchin' for synergy\nSuckin' my seed, chakra tease stickin' sippin' Hennessy, shittin'\nOn the hissin' I'll spit you out of commission\nPosition the bitch and dip in when I mention slip in submission\nAll of this is to quicken the copulatin' and kissin'\nMy operation is drippin' to the bottom, shakin' and strippin'\nOdd when I bust, KOD put 'em in Necropolis\nGivin' this rod to the good broads, and they givin' they bras to us\nWith the gift to break up a couple that's monogamous\nStop with the probs and take off your effin' draws, bitch and rock with us\nBeen giddy 'cause them titties are on my chin-chinny\nChin, did he pretend he was again kiddie?\nSuckin' the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me and the skin pretty\nDim lit he, then hitting thee trim in Sin City\nLet it in, I'm the medicine, get her wetter than ever been\nNever better than a veteran, level that in the bed again\nRockin' red, I been in my letterman, bright as Edison\nLike I said I sin, head I win at events and I\u2019m fetishin'\nOpen up, you hoes, you know what's up\nTold you when I bust, her clothes they wanna just\nGo right off her butt, for sure they wanna cut\nExplode, drop a load 'cause the flow is\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine\nSo ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)\nSo Thorazine, so morphine\nSo dope that they wanna have sex\nSo dope they wanna (fuck)\n\n[Verse 2: Wrekonize]\nShe said \"I heard that you was packin', I'ma fan of your rappin'\nI'm feining action, where you really from, Cape Town?\"\nI said \"Yeah bitch, and I was born in London\nSo I'm thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you with the crumpets and some cake now\"\nHow did we get so stereotypical?\nFairly so seminal now I'm flowin' to the pinnacle\nI see you got some friends who just lookin' to get it from the medic\nSo I'ma 'bout to pivot on 'em and I make rounds\nWant a piece of the beast from the East?\nComplete in the sheets, release beats, got her man down\nYour boy just never could compete with us, please better believe\nWe skeet, now wipe yourself off with a ShamWow\nMe and Nina run deeper than receivers\nI beat up all on her beaver now she wanna feed the meter!\nSpeakers bumpin' tweeters from here up into Medina\nLeave us pleasin', all your nieces screamin' \"Take Me to Your Leader\"\nI'm trainspottin' the vein rockin' the lane off and came droppin'\nSerious game all on your brain, rottin'!\nPick a million pricks and I'm pretty sure that you missed the one\nThat hits you on the clit, quick drip, I be the main option\nBlowin' the slut up just for good luck\nAnd I'm fuckin' the kitty up with the angel dust in my nuts\nTrophy lovin' cup and that dopin' is such a must\nThat it's troublesome to give up when they lust\nSo dope they wanna\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine\nSo ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)\nSo Thorazine, so morphine\nSo dope that they wanna have sex\nSo dope they wanna (fuck)\n\n[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]\nLovin' to get it up in it in the back of the room and make 'em scream and\nGoin' up in it deep as she was feindin\u2019 when she saw my weiner\nShe told me she ready for anything, I'm talkin' anything\nI stuck it up in her jaws, I\u2019m breakin' walls like I was Katrina\nNot even know me but she know my flow is OG\nShe told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely\nHomie if I was only right there instead of a Sony\nYou claimin' the pussy wet but don't tell me baby, just show me\nShe ask if I'm comin' up with the mask in my entrance\nSinner in a second, real spitter like every sentence\nShe was there for repentance, ever since I was an infant\nI'm damagin' the vagina, remind you I'm filled with vengeance\nHit 'em whenever they wanna run up and they doing it 'cause I rap and shit\nI really don't care, whatever it takes to get 'em up on the mattress\nI could have been the one that's on the run for busting a gun\nBut this is way more fun to get up in these motherfucking actresses\nIn bikinis and suckin' on my zucchini\nShe told me she wanna be me while sippin' Apple Martinis\nFuck it if I'm a meanie, she probably would never leave me\nShit I can play eenie meanie from sly and cuff on my weenie\nAnd now I see 'em whenever I hit the stage\nThey posted up in the audience, all of 'em filled with hope\nKnowin' they only wanna be in the presence\nOr get affiliated with you because you was dope\nSo dope they wanna\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine\nSo ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)\nSo Thorazine, so morphine\nSo dope that they wanna have sex\nSo dope they wanna (fuck)\n\n[Verse 4: Snow Tha Product]\nHey now Tech, you know I've been the type\nTo not go all in on hoes I've been around\nBut the flow I spit gets hoes all in the zone\nThat I won\u2019t talk shit but oh my damn they wrong\nAnd these men calling in, they're wondering if I\u2019ma get with a little dick\nThey got no common sense and with no collage in\nTheir position is probably something insignificant\nIf you think I\u2019m a bitch 'cause I probably missed the game you kickin'\nThey be hollering, hope I acknowledging because I have been methodically\nDropping the common knowledge that I don\u2019t get down like that\nNow they be hounding a bitch or probably get with a trick\nOr a treat 'cause they dogs and they all gon' bark like that\nI\u2019m killing the game, killing the game, killing the game\nSo he feeling me, he want to bang, I want to wait\nSo he get at me, he want to say shit that make\nMe think that he gon' rape me if I don\u2019t stay\n'Cause I got that sickening style that built me a crowd\nAnd men and women feelin' me now and it's freaking me out\n'Cause I\u2019m just here to figure it out and what this is about\nBut I\u2019ma say it\u2019s getting so wild that it\u2019s tripping me out\n'Cause I\u2019m not here to kill the morale, just kill all these sounds\nBut lately when I spit to a crowd, these men just reach out\nAnd they tell me that they women is down, they gettin' aroused\nAnd they be tryin' to give me they child with a gin and a smile\nThey say they wanna (fuck)"

untame with it\nGet this chopper like I'm fully a bully with a hoodie\nShould he get up and take 'em out or spit 'caine with it?\nWell the answer is right before your eyes - who do you despise?\nKillers who chop you we got to stop you\nPop you partner, you gushin'\nGet up outta the way when Tecca Nina be bustin'\nGotta give it up, I\u2019m a veteran like Edison\nI\u2019ma light 'em

can I make you understand I'm a general\nEven if you poppin' the competition is minimal\nKan-city killers and you can bet that we criminal\nThe demon inside of me keep on tellin' me when to go\nSo I\u2019ma keep reppin' the midwest choppers freakin' flows\nAnd I\u2019m 'bout to be up on top of this and truly be bustin'\nBeggin' for mercy, you punk I ain\u2019t givin' you nothing

and Dalima enter the center\nAnd get coded and when in the competition we for sure to kill 'em\nI spit like a fully and ready made, through any type of weather\nWith the Beretta tucked right under my sweater\nAnd we hotter than lava\nThe way that my gillas be keepin' it poppin'\nPartner you tight, but my gillas are better\nWe keep it choppin' like a blender, eatin' boys up for dinner\nGuillotines, we chop your heads off, and throw 'em out the window\nWe too critical, we ill and you walking away looking so pitiful\nThe AGT we be the number one contenders\n(When it come to the street we still post on the block)\n40 Cal. on my lap and my middle finger up to the cops\nOn the way to the studio to go and make another hot track\nThey be lovin' the way that we spit it when we drop\nThey call me D-Loc, so the functioning definition of a soldier\nMy opposition is more culture than Rocha\nI spit like a Tommy and anybody in my way I\u2019ma fold 'em\nAnd me and my gilla gorillas want it 'cause we the coldest boys\nBe tryin' to battle 'cause they want our position\nBut they can never get in it because we better and bigger\nAnd like I told you we the number one competitors dealin'\nWorkin' their way up to the top and they won't stop til they get the millions\nIn the hone of the century D-Loc and Dalima\nChemistry, you can never cross with them\nIgganas idah the ebe ossinbay the yricala\nIggertra eavela otherma uckerfay\u2019s lost\nYou can try to read us, you can try to beat us\nTry to get your speed up, but it ain\u2019t gon' matter\n'Cause after we get finished bustin' there ain\u2019t gon' be no laughter\nWe takin' over the map with Tecca Nina the master (master)\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nWe can sang or we can bang\nIt ain\u2019t no game we untamed\nWhether it\u2019s

Lamar, and Macklemore sharing the same stage\nI'm the nigga all these artists look up to\nYet for Tech, it's been the hardest to bust through\nBut I keep my fans fiendin' like clucks do\nYou don't like how we living, well... (\"Fuck you\")\nI dominate your conglomerate, want a beating? I can accommodate\nIt'll be a non-debate, coming up against Aaron the Great\nSo many got arms, legs and necks tatted, Strange\n'Cause music, show, conceptually, I'm the best at it\nLet's have it for all of these Tech addicts\nAny disrespect to family will get your chest gatted\nAimin' at 'em and it's agony\nBurner blew his brain in back and these\nCannons came and caved in cavity, caliber connect, cap it\nYo, there it go, red is in my head, it grow\nHeaded fo', lead and deaded, yeah, the medic said it so\nLet it grow, shred it and get no credits, so pathetic though\nDread embedded steppin' in heaven's crevice, wet and edible\nGive her the shivers when I deliver this\nHit her then quit her 'cause she's on Twitter shit\nAnd when she compared me to Eminem, I said \"I'm different\"\nShe said \"How?\", I said \"I'm black and I can say 'nigger', bitch!\"\nTo him, I may be just another bro with a flow\nWho'll probably never tour 'cause it'll be thousands of Juggalos at a show\nAnd I heard fatalities happen on each side, so that's never no let it go\nSo I get it, I keep what I'm makin' incredible, all of them scared of a negro\nStrangeulation, this occupation so scandalous\nWe stop the hatin', no chances\nWhen I rock the nation, so Danzig\nI'm killing all these niggas, Operation Code Kansas\nStrange gang plain triggered assassins\nGot a bunch of untamed aimed trained spitters a' blastin'\nMy insane brain sayin' \"Give up the rappin'\nAnd go back to the gang bang thang\", nigga, what's happenin'?

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nI'm an angel/demon, man\nYou know what I'm sayin', what makes me a demon is lust a girl crazy and that's why I couldn't keep my wife\nYou know what I'm sayin', and that's the lust demon livin' within me\nAnd, uh, but my heart love big, you know what I'm sayin', so\nI know a lot of demons come to my shows, as well as angels\nYou know what I'm sayin', a lot of demons\n\n[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]\nWhen I was one, and-a two, and-a three, and-a four\nI knew I was a special one who had a little more\nAnd they wondered why I was plum rotten to the core\nIt was nothing but an itty-bitty demon\n\n[Post-Hook: Tech N9ne]\nThere's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)\nCan I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)\nThere's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)\nCan I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nYo, it make me wanna drink a lot, go up in the pink with not\nThis the reason I ain't at ease and currently on the brink of pop\nThis the reason I sit at the window with the millie\nWishing a nigga gon' come break in\nThis is the reason I be freaking a woman deeper\nLoving making her silly because I done they friends\nIt is the reason I bang, it is definitely the reason I slang\nDistributed the 'caine\nThe reason I'm super-soaking in the pain, and starting to love it\nIt's wanting to give me way more of it, they want me to lug it through the mud\nAnd thus the reason with happy people I'm disgusted\nI'm talking about those thangs that make you do bad thangs\nLiving the evil up in the fast lane\nMaking me want to have a wicked persona\nBeating the hell up out of people making me mad, mane\nGave me the gun when I ran up in dealings in the ninth grade, with a slight rage\nI was Ice Age, another reason Tecca Nina won't have any light days\nVoted me the King of Darkness, voted me to be really heartless\nAll up in my spirit they march, they making me start sparking other targets\nWoke up today I was steaming, 'cause when I found out I was not dreaming\nBecause the host that influenced me the most was a goddamn demon\n\n[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]\nWhen I was one, and-a two, and-a three, and-a four\nI knew I was a special one who had a little more\nAnd they wondered why I was plum rotten to the core\nIt was nothing but an itty-bitty demon\n\n[Post-Hook: Tech N9ne]\nThere's a demon inside of me, can I kill it?

Fucking forsaking everything I am?\nAnother pissed motherfucker with a fist and a plan\nOh, but you're making me do this\nI can scream while you stand there clueless\nIf you're listening, I've made up my mind\nTake another step, but I'm fed this time\n\n[Post-Chorus: Tech N9ne]\nSomething, please save me, I'm losing myself\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne & Corey Taylor]\nI don't think I wanna stop it, but the feeling inside is nauseous\nI get really exhausted off it, gotta find a way to wash it, lock it\nProfit nada so I got to drop it, ain't nobody in the cockpit toss this lostness\nPeople from the office boxes, if you cross this boss, live cautious\nDon't make me, don't make me repeat myself\nFor your safety because a pilly is beneath my belt\nBut I don't wanna do anything bad to anybody, but I'll never be perfect\nSo I'mma say to the people that got a little evil coming at you from me, I think they deserve it\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nGoing, withering away\nGoing, withering away\nGoing, withering away\nGone\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Tech N9ne]\nStraight, literally snapping out, my lady backing out 'cause I'm becoming really mean and vicious\nWatching me wither, how can I give her love when I been so tainted by these bitches\n\n[Chorus: Corey Taylor]\nWe are the arsenal\nChemically imbalanced, completely disposable\nSo butter my knuckles and taste it\nAnother sick delinquent is wasted\nI don't forgive, I don't forget\nI haven't got time to regret\nEverybody else in the world can hate me\nNobody but me can save me\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne & Corey Taylor]\nShit, Yates hates this place\nIf you're close enough to me to hit the switch, you better never turn it on\nI get the feeling I'm gonna be craving a killing, I gotta be real and the evil'll fill up and sucker the middle man till he be gone"

Hard to see me like the background\nYour rap styles coming softer than a cats meow\nRed laces, but booted like I'm Iraq bound\nThat frown'll get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town\nSo relax pal, pat down, gat down, back down, blackout\nWith a fat smile, I might react foul\nSo don't make this cat growl\nI caught everybody when I spazzed wow, who do I catch now?\n\n[Hook]\nWho do I catch now?\nMaybe those who can't get with the rap sound\nI caught the industry, who do I catch now?\nWho do I catch now?\nMaybe those who told me to put the rap down\nI caught the whole world, who do I catch now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI caught wreck, AND THEN I caught checks\nAND THEN I caught press, AND THEN I caught sex, YES\nAnd no permanent diseases were caught when I caught that\nNow the games been offset, 'cause I'm strange in a lost mess\nI caught a lot of shit being different, they tried to hinder Tech\nBy calling him devil worshiper, surfaced up on the internet\nMy temper gets grimmer just as winter sets, I'm a venter, yes\nAnd I can't forget when the finger pressed triggers, I can't remember that\nI caught stars attention, N9na had a large ascension\nSo high the lord is squintin', (NOPE), I mean y'all are squintin', (OKAY)\n'Cause I'm tall as Pippen , (NOPE), got a flawless vision, (OKAY)\nOn a lawless mission, (NOPE), 'cause I'm ballish pimpin', (YEAH!)\nBest believe I caught fades\nNever homie soft made, I'm active, no off days\nAnd I got boss paid with music, I caught babes\nAnd I even caught gays before they all caught AIDS\n\n[Hook]\nWho do I catch now?\nMaybe those who can't get with the rap sound\nI caught the industry, who do I catch now?\nWho do I catch now?\nMaybe those who told me to put the rap down\nI caught the whole world, who do I catch now?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI hit a pot of gold, with the harder flow\nYou haters oughta know, that we are the MO\nThis is my land, you in my hand and you's a particle\nAnd I see you marvel over the fact I caught Tha Carter IV\nSo that means I caught Martians already\nAnd you talk shit about that, because often y'all petty\nAnd because you jelly sicklin', its costing y'all Bettys\nTo get tossed in our headache 'cause we lost in tall fetty\nAyy, you catch the vapors 'cause N9na, he catch hoes\nAnd you non believers are funny people, like Seth Rog\nBetter pay attention, 'cause if you simpin' ya get froze\nAnd I'ma leave you with a wet nose, when I'm ripping they catch colds\n\n[Interlude]\nWhen I\u2019m rippin', they catch colds?\nAy, that make sense, don\u2019t it, Ben?\nLyrically, I\u2019m cold blooded\nThey be like \u201cah-ah-choo!\"\n\n[Hook]\nWho do I catch now?\nMaybe those who can't get with the rap sound\nI caught the industry, who do I catch now?\nWho do I catch now?\nMaybe those who told me to put the rap down\nI caught the whole world, who do I catch now?"

Who that? That's me\nWho that? Who that? K-Dean\nWhen I was comin' up in the game everybody was tellin' me\n'I really be killin' a lot of you niggas, I'm mean'\nFuckin' with my niggas D-Loc and Dalima\nThey told me, 'I be really gotta be a murderin' killin' machine'\nI didn't care about nothing but rappin' my way to the top\nFuckin' with my nigga Tech, he told me I'm hot\nAnybody got a problem with any one of my niggas\nI\u2019ll pull out the 9 mill I betchu it'll pop\nBring the heat, bring the noise, bring the flames\nAnything that you bring, I'ma tame\nPuttin' dirt on the top of my name\nPull back and I click-click, bang\nAsk Tech, he'll tell you I'm strange\nIf you ever wanna talk about me\nI'ma run up, gun up and leave you with no brain\nThen you'll know my flow is insane\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast\nI be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper\nEven though I'm all up in the Northwest\nAll across the U.S\nOverseas, Midwest Choppers\n\nAy-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)\nAy-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Yeah, Midwest Choppers)\nAy-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)\nAy-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Nigga, Midwest Choppers)\n\n[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]\nCome, come get some of this\nMidwest murda music, murda music, murda music\nCome, come get some of this\nMidwest murda music, murda music, murda music\nLet me hit 'em\nWhen I get 'em, I'ma split 'em, I'ma kill 'em\nI'm the nigga with the lyrical venom finna get up in them\nWhen they give me the instrumental\nI finish 'em, diminish 'em\nI guarantee that murda is a minimum\nBut lately I been givin' 'em hell\nThey don't really wanna see me, I'm servin' 'em swell\nCall me a monster, verse designer, first to bomb ya\nLeathaface pullin' up in that hearse beside ya\nMurda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murdered 'em all, kill 'em all\nKrayzie kill 'em all, they fall\nIt's a lyrical execution\nWe snap faster, we the rap masters\nSqueeze the gat, blast it, if that's how it gots to be\nSo they better get it ready\n'Cause I'm heated like an AK-47 spittin' bullet fuckin' lyrics out of me\nThen they tell 'em, that\u2019s crazy, Jackson\nHe\u2019s amazin' actually, stay in action\nRap singin' at ya, I brings it at you\nI'm kinda like an automatic aimin' at ya\nAnd I don't want a little bit of flame to ashes\nYou know you really truly insane to madness\nYou never really find another niggas more scandalous\nThan this Midwest blastin'' family\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast\nI be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper\nEven though I'm all up in the Northwest\nAll across the U.S\nOverseas, Midwest Choppers\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI am the definition of murda\nThe N9ne is now coming to serve ya\nYou're running but you can't go no furtha\n'Cause I'm running through you with no sign of inertia\nGimme the mic and I bet that you duck\nIt's what you betta do when I'm bussin' I be flippin', I'm incredible\nNever get on my level, I'm a killa with the pedal to the medal\nYou're edible and ya death is so inevitable\nI can take it to ya mama, ya daddy's, in the back of a caddy\nYou cut up when the sack in the back of you, I wanna\nTake it out and make it patty, you gotta be batty\n'Cause that\u2019ll be bad if you decide to get mad, is you gonna?\nYou can listen to me and see I'm the nigga with the ammunition\nI'm givin' the livin' a vision of death\nMakin' 'em sick and depressed\n'Cause I be givin' everything\nI'm a rebel and I'm still with the quick and the best\nMakin' a mark in the business\nI get up in it to rip and diminish ya\nTrip and I finish ya\nDig it, you really get me livid, I'm 'bout give it a pivot\nI'ma stick it so we can dip into sinister\nI be the chopper that got ya little boppers goin' off us\nBetter not let me up on the premises\n'Cause I'm a doctor that's out for the shotaz when I brought ya\nBe cautious never talk of this nemesis\nWe on top of the hill when it come to the skill\nOther rappers are damn jokers\nThey be givin' the people comedy\nBut the Tecca N9na misery shit is Bram Stoker\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast\nI be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper\nEven though I'm all up in the Northwest\nAll across the U.S\nOverseas, Midwest Choppers"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nI was born in November, 8th day, 1971st y'all\n9 o'clock in the morning a Christian girl\nIn Kansas City gave birth, yaah\nShe taught the kid how to love\nAnd give all praises to our maker till the earth fall\nThen mama married a Muslim when I was 12\nAnd the transition was the worst y'all\nI converted to Islam, but every once in awhile\nI'd read a bible verse, yaah\nHow am I to refrain from eatin' pork\nAnd havin' Christmas when I'm thirst ahh?\nAll of this it was blended, many religions\nPlenty women down my shirt, yaah\nAt home no longer attended\nWhen I was 17 I bounced like a nerf ball\n\n[Verse: Tech N9ne]\nYeeeeah! (Spit a bit quick!)\nBy day I slay, Pai Mei, trick, (don't get a bitch hit!)\nI'm Master Ip'in it, I'm flyin' around with equipment\nReally big time and now I'm not fitness, bitch\nI'm ridin' around and I'm grittin' it\nTo the people, the people that want the evil, I'm givin' you\nThat and a coupla others a (Klusterfuk!)\nOf a brotha which you discover I (Crush mucks up!)\nIn the gutter 'cause I'm a thug and their (Tough just struck!)\nOn you mo'fuckers I'll be the blood brother\nGivin' you love from a slug if you bug on a nigga\nTug on a trigga, no hugs, I'ma kiss her with\nGrudges and plug her with drugs when I give her dick\nFatherly when I spit on these kiddies, don't bother me\nIn the brown and red dickies, Mahogany\nRed all over me like I hit a artery\nFuck all of these, hypocrites, lick a dick, just swallow me\nIf you follow me and wanted to abolish me\nWhen I'm honestly straight oddity\nI'm just twisted, non-fictitious, on this wicked shit (Spit a bit quick!)\nReady whenever, machete will sever the head or\nBe dead up then the leg up in the metal and (Big thick bricks!)\nPucker up, suck this nutter butter, gutter slut\nIf you wonder what is uttered this is Klusterfuk!\nEver seen a nigga with hella followers\nAnd they love a nigga so much if he wanna tell them to kill?\nHa-ha-ha-ha-hah! And they will!\nSo ya better watch that, no it ain't a shock tactic, got that bit down to the grill\nHeh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heeeh! Way real!\nI got the shit that get the crowd jumpin'\nMoshin', a lotta thumpin', silly just like a drunken monkey!\nNigga, we punkin' flunkies! Killa, we krunk and funky!\nUhh, pumpin' chunky! Uhh, booty bitches in the bunk with a donkey, eh!\nCrazy, I might be way in my psyche, laid as a bright P.A\nPlayin', they wanna fight me\nThey don't really like me\nDay and the night replay\nYeah, I'm good and a little bit of evil\nInside of me, they about equal\nCall it a bust, when I'm all in a rut\nI'm a Klusterfuk, nigga y'all is just (Fecal!)\n\n[Chorus 1: Tech N9ne]\nGrowin' up low enough must have sucked (People!)\nCall me what? Call me a Klusterfuk (Fecal!)\nGrowin' up low enough must have sucked (People!)\nCall me what? Call me a Klusterfuk\n\n[Interlude: Sassy]\nTalk about growin' up fucked up\nI grew up with a mentally ill mother, so it's no wonder that I'm slightly askew\nHer fanatical religious views had me sittin' in pews eight days a week\nAnd because of that, me and God didn't speak for a while\nNow I crack a smile when I'm asked my religious preference\nI utter a Tech N9ne reference replying: \"I'm a Klusterfuk\"\nI mixed up all the stuff that religion had to offer\nBoiled it in my cauldron 'till the bullshit burned off it, all that was left was love\nI can't say I always rise above the trivial shit in my life, 'cause I don't\nSometimes my ego won't allow me to walk away, if you know what I'm sayin'\nI've done a lot of drugs, shit, I've done a lot of thugs, but in the end\nAs long as I'm aligned with love, then I know I'm livin' righteous\n\n[Chorus 2: Tech N9ne]\nBy a landslide my energy!\nWill kill a man, why try mimic me?!\nCause the fans tied identically!\nLove it when the fans buy my memories!\nBy a landslide my energy!\nWill kill a man, why try mimic me?!\nCause the fans tied identically!\nLove it when the fans buy my memories!\n\n[Chorus 1 & 2]\nBy a landslide my energy! (Growin' up low enough must have sucked)\nWill kill a man, why try mimic me?!\nCause the fans tied identically! (Call me what? Call me a Klusterfuk)\nLove it when the fans buy my memories!\nBy a landslide my energy! (Growin' up low enough must have sucked)\nWill kill a man, why try mimic me?!\nCause the fans tied identically! (Call me what? Call me a Klusterfuk)\nLove it when the fans buy my memories!"

Hood]\nI told you bitches where the fuck I'm from\nShowed you this is where the luck might run\nOut full of doubt\nWhat you do wit' yo' mouth about to be part of the reason I come and bust my gun\nFinna give up wanna be just like dumb\nNigga's a boar, be hunted just like one\nThis no war nor kick time, son\nIt's a warning, do nothing dumb\nYou can feel what it is when exposed to the G's\nA real one exists this close to the league\nGet ahold of the disk, you suppose to believe\nHe showed with the trip, and the flow's a disease\nCoke gotta fizz, got zones of the trees\nNever let 'em live, let alone let 'em breathe\nNot a fuck I could give, like \"fucks, what are these?\"\n[?] hoes Lebanese\nStrange got the game in a guillotine choke\nLanguage aimed seen finna be quo\u2014ted\nKnow it ain't my enemy hope\nSwank if you can't consider me dope\nYa skank wanna grope me and Joey Cool both\nOn the bull with a 7, no Toni Kuko\u010d\nBitch check-in to whenever you post\nLike her method would works, still whenever you close\nYou know what I'm yelling, yo somebody better tell 'em!\nHardhead make a soft-ass, let me get 'em\nUp in art class was the only time he drew a weapon\nAt the bar blurred lines, I'm a urban legend\nNo T.I. TMI but I'm fuckin' with protection\nPaperwork are red like I'm makin' a correction\nSelect what I said, hope you makin' the connection\nWe come at a nigga head, it come off him in a second\nMe and Tech got high, said we finna do work\nSpat hot lava, finna shoot first\nShow respect not vibe like I could only do churches\nMy nigga wasn't alive, I am in the booth hurt!\nKnow that I'ma ride, but I tell 'em B. Hood\nYou would look odd in my neck of the woods\nIf I really wanna slide in your ho I could\nBut I'm God with a double O, dawg know I'm good!\nStep like I should!\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nI steps like a real should\nPapered but still hood, we whip it and feel good\nAyy, we makin' your bitches feel good\nYanked it and still could, we whip it and feel good\nI steps like a real should\nPapered but still hood, we whip it and feel good\nAyy, we makin' your bitches feel good\nYanked it and still could, we whip it and feel good"

My music truly strong\nBecause I'm different all you cowards wanna shoo me gone\nYes this is Strange year, worldwide fame's near\nBut the game's queer\nSometime I feel like I'm Rudolph the Reindeer\nAnd the music they said blows is on top and the cred grows\nYou're gonna have to open up the door for the bro with the red nose\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's real, people act a different way with me\nI feel don't nobody wanna play with me\nAnd that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes\nThe industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose\nRed nose, red nose\nThey put me down and treat me like I got a red nose\nRed nose, red nose\nDon't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose"

It's on for tonight\n(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight\n(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light\n(No!) A lot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhy you wanna try to take my bill ticket?\nI mean real wicked, I seem real livid\nI've been filled with it, I mean vexed\nUn-ex-pect-ted-ness, when everything is the best\nI get a minute to rest, but then a nigga regrets\nI gets the money but next I'm in debt\n(I won, what?) I mean I lost, take green from a boss\nBe the things that I dream, but they intervene they get my creme, then I'm off\n(Whose they?)\nThey turned the motherfuckin' best position into a deposition\nDealing with that will make you wanna ex the mission\nNever no checks to get to and that's the bitching\nHow do I maintain my autonomy\nWith so many leeches in this economy?\nMy moaning is mearly monetary\nBut the moment it's really gone is scary\nTry to beat my high score, but I fight forward despite lawyers\nAn eye for an eye because my type's warrior\nNever the less I inherit a mess, a big floor spill\nI'm steady pushing to break down this fortune force field\n\n[Chorus]\n(So!) It's on for tonight\n(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight\n(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light\n(No!) A lot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, it's like pulling a bad one\nGet her off at the pad, then get the Jimmy to stab some\nBut you can't and puddy is right there\nLike a, barrier or something, keeping you from her such a negative type lair\nYou can never pipe nair when you've got it in front of you, wanna do, it's a pitiful nightmare\nIt's like making a baby\nYou never having it, is making you crazy\nAnd toting a living human, it's making you weighty\nKick, kick, kick, shaking your lady\nLike late in the 80's, got my name and got to taking the stage, V\nTold the people I got Satan to save me, that's why radio be hating to play me\nEverything you gain only brings you pain\nBut the fame it fools the brain\nBut you regain it through Strange\nYeah, never put your guard down\nBecause I wanna bang, bang, bang hard now\nI'm a warhound, never mistaken I kick walls down\nTo the ground and get applause sound because I got even, then I'm lard bound\n\n[Chorus]\n(So!) It's on for tonight\n(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight\n(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light\n(No!) A lot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Bridge]\nLot of dreams are lost in the night\nLot of dreams are lost in the night\nFuck your litigation\nWe gon' win, just a bit of waiting\nEverytime that I get ahead gotta be a motherfuckin' drawback\nSo I'mma draw back and bang them bitches 'til they all crack\nMSC look what you've done to me\nKept the first five I done for me\nAnd you others know that Caribou Lou belong to me\nYou come for me\nJust know we will never settle, war is what it's gonna be!\n\n[Chorus]\n(So!)

Exclusive (Chea), and I know that I might fall\n\u2018Cause life is stupid, \u2018cause cupid shoots it and I fight off\nWhat it might produce, its love, whatever has it I run\nPeople, pets and even movies that have it, I shun\nThinkin' back when I had a family, was glad I was some\nI picture myself in the future, old mad, sad \u2018cause I\u2019m one\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nOh, ain\u2019t no phones ringin'\nAin\u2019t no one speakin' when you\u2019re alone\nOh, feels like there's no reason\nFor me to keep breathin' if I\u2019m gonna be alone\nI can\u2019t sleep alone\nAnd I can\u2019t go eat alone\nYeah, the crowd gon' shout\nBut when the lights go out you know, you know, you know\nYou know, you know, you know, you know\nYou know, you know, you know, you know\nYou know me being me\nYou wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d be\nYe\u2014ye\u2014ye\u2014ye, alone\n\n[Outro]\nStrange Music"

O. D. oh K. O. D. oh\nWhat if, he is, what he says he is?\nThe King Of Darkness!\nK. O. D. oh K. O. D. oh\nWhat if, he is, what he says he is?\nThe King Of Darkness!\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nXes lliw eb yrotadnam yliad\nYlthgin, this women need to be living by it\nStay fit n' way driven paste it and dye it\nI am the king killer captain crazed frigging pilot\nGiving you these khaki pants and white shirt\nThat's what you wear on my Earth\nEliminating your eye thirst to have any kind of desires\nTo envy material or admire, my way will extract any type of divider\nI'm offering this wider\nUnderstanding of life entirely\nBlissfully evading friction and fire, chea\nThe number N9ne will get you food, even get you tools\nTo build anything your family choose, but within my rules\nAll white shoes with red strings for all my crews\nThat lets me know you Tech's people listening inside my pews\nAll your dreams and aspirations, this is the affirmation\nThat you can reach 'em in my world it's not a disaster waiting\nNo bruises and lacerations no choosers of aggravation\nI'm just try'na rehab a nation from exasperation\nIt's not an exaggeration, I'm something more than your blood and gore\nOn a level higher than devils or that of Satan\n\n[Hook: Mackenzie O'Guin]\nWhat if?\nK.

D. oh\nWhat if, he is, what he says he is?\nThe King Of Darkness!\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nWhen I did 'Anghellic' I was good and bad, straight confused\nThen an angel turned to \"Devil Boy\" when the 'Reparation' blew\nThen demons had 'Absolute Power' when I drug abused\nSo the angels searched for the 'Vintage Tech'\nBut they found that the love was through\nThen an accident would happen that made life look necessary\nSo now receiving God, the angel was 'Everready'\nBut the 'Melancholy' strikes, the loving angels mommy's life\nSo the 'Misery' sat in the angels now becoming ice\nSo as mom got ill and iller, when it hurts her he can feel her\nTo the strain of the pain made him bane\nThere's no more angel straight up 'Killer'!\nMy apologies, it's not very God of me\nTo go crazy and try to teach the whole world 'Sickology'\nI was then split in two, back to the beginning view\nAngel/demon 'cause the killer showed me death was overdue\nBut I gotta live for my kids, all the evil stuff I did\nTaught me to teach you, you can love big no matter how much mud you dig\nOr dug, you met my demon back when I had that grudge\nBut I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above\nI'm mostly angel, and you know sometime we fall\nLiving under God and I hope it's listening when I say I love you all!"

(Off right!)\nWe got Tecca N9na in the house tonight! Come on!\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nThis is the moment for riders and thugs\nStrippers in body bags, zippers and violence and drugs\nPoverty, a bunch of minorities die in the club\nThey say my music's making 'em lose it, I write it in blood\nThis is my music for all my people missing my music\nKeep listening to it, and like I said, get a pistol and use it\nSatan shot my homie Maintain with a missile and blew it\nFor the industry, 'cause he was one of the truest\nI don't know why they be pumpin', it's somethin'\nMaybe in the music wanna be bumpin'\nIt's crunk and it's hella haterific\nThrow your set up in the air is all the DJ really wanna play\nWhen it's over it's looking bloody and satanistic\nKillas from everywhere listen to me when I be bustin' shit\nI'm turbulence, some get nervous when I wreck arenas\nConcert promoters in Honolulu don't wanna see me\n'Cause they say that Samoans will riot on Tecca N9na\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\n'Cause I'm a riot maker!

Niggas need a new doctor\nStop the bleeding, who shot ya?\nIt was really a true chopper\nMike is who offed ya\nMainly because you caca\nStep and see who do block ya\nRest in peace to Moustapha\n\n[Hook]\nMy mental's made of Michael Myers' mask\nYou... lay lifeless, Lord don't like yo liars laugh\nWho... wanna see this sinful psycho sire spaz?\nPlease don't light yo lighters last\n'Cause this frightful fire's fast (uh-huh)\nMy mental's made of Michael Myers' mask\nYou... lay lifeless, Lord don't like yo liars laugh\nWho... wanna see this sinful psycho sire spaz?\nPlease don't light yo lighters last\n'Cause this frightful fire's fast (uh-huh)\n\n[Outro]\nMr. Sandman, nobody wants to see you\nMy Tony Moran stand"

Like trying to fit my dick inside my wedding ring\nAnd all the bread it brings will be distributed and properly\nI represent for hip hop not some fucking aristocracy\n\n[Verse 4: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nI'm the Martin Scorsese of rap, rap predator\nBetter than severin' the reverend with a jackknife\nKevin and eleven of 'em, revvin' up the engines\nWe bubblin' up like 7-Up, then when\nWe shoot that shit, we eat that shit for din-din, grrr\nI don't need ya fuckin' okay, ah, are you serious? I'm okay\nI'mma make you bleed like it's your period, period\nI eat period pussy so eating you ain't serious\nWhat, you need for me to flip that shit and rip that shit\nLike a skitzo, stick that shit, that shit, like a automatic pistol grip?\nNo! I created this fast rap, I'm past that\nI put a gat in that ass crack and blast that\nI'm light years ahead of 'em, might use the head of 'em\nI lose, then you can keep the breadcrumbs\nGrrr, my nigga, I'm a carnivore\nReady for any kind of war, any kind of score"

Owoh! Owoh!\nOthers ain't got a clue, they coming through suspicious\nWe do the shit we do\n'Cause if you not with the crew converting you is our mission\nIf you're a born Technician\nPut your ammunition and your hands up in the sky\nThis is a strong addiction\nLive to this if ya Technician 'til ya die\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nMy people all know what a Bianca is\nMost of 'em want to diss\nDon't come unless you don't want the biz\nIt ain't nothin' but real women in my circle, not them phony chicks\nThat don't know what I mean when I say elbow macaroni bitch\nThey know what I'm drinking, the ladies looking right, they know what I'm thinking\nThe babies even hype, the oldies be geekin'\nThe red, the black, and white, the soldiers beef seekin'\nAll of my people's here, Tech and the bidness are gonna equal fear\n'Cause I'm 'bout to bubble and get the evil peers\nOut of my life I never wanna see you here (Yeah!)\nBitch! You ain't a Technician\nYou don't know the pledge, but you said that you listen\nGuess you misunderstood the shit, huh?\nDisrespect that Tech trick get done\nThe moral of the story is we warriors\nNotorious for the hordes of core, ready to roar he is glorious\nTechnician number one\nThe mission leave 'em sprung with the tongue\nAnd if you listen it's a gun\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nTechnicians!\nOwoh!

(oh, Jesus! Jesus!)\nEvery day they wanna condemn me\nNone of 'em even know me\nAnyone live without sin cast that stone at the Stone\nLet's talk about it\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nI'm askin'\nWhat's happening?\nBoy, 'cause they bashing me\nBangin' the bible, butcher boy, don't bother with blasphemy\nCall 'em a crazy critic comin' causin' catastrophes\nAimin' at Aaron a lot of ammo and an angel actually\nOh mane, Amen\nYou people let the steeples speak in evil and the neezle playing God hymn\nMy mother was a Christian but I used to go with the Wiccan for the stickin', what\u2019s the problem?\nQuestioning the K.O.D.'s grim, anybody talkin' hella crazy I'm 'bout to jaw them\nYou'll be up on a cross whenever you step to me so take precaution\nY'all false actors, callin' me a demon when I talk backwards tihs pot\nTecca Nina gon' be sought after, this drop by the people that go toss rappers hip hop\nSo you thinking you religious?\nWhen you condemn another man, you never lead us\nTelling me what's under me is gonna heat us\nNever believe ya 'cause really you need Jesus\nLeave us\n\n[Bridge: Stevie Stone]\nTalk about me, judge me\nSpeakin' I'm evil to people, I'm leadin' 'em underway\nHow you read me and see me, easy to be shunned away\nBut you got it all wrong\nLet's talk about it\n\n[Verse 3: JL of B. Hood]\nMama never really talked about God\nAll that I was ever taught was I'm odd\nHeard he knew 'bout every thought that I had\nDirty mind I'd see a cross and I'd hide\nLost without dad, salty 'bout that\nBut I was captivated by the bosses outside\nI plotted every way to get in drawers with my squad (church)\nAsk round why every man goes\nBad habits to pass down like second hand clothes, mad\nSalvage a blouse, gown, and manicured toes\nHad half of us ground bound for hell and lord knows\nNeed a savior they say slayed for your behavior\nRaised in three days, grace be what he gave ya\nThe Son of the maker, one to gravitate to\nPay ten percent 'cause sins ya didn\u2019t pay for\nBow to a name insane fast, he told the\nVows to a dame, the tame Casanova\nWow did it change and came crashing, poser\nDoused in the flames and bang chapter closure\nSpiritually drained, crass and vulgar\nNeeded somewhere to go until rain passes over\nSeeking a miracle from a stained-glass Jehovah\nBut I don't know if the ordained pastor sober\nDang in disdain prayed in vain\nCare slain yo, explain do anything\nLay hands, but role playing, you entertain\nDoubt, pain, processin' grow in the brain\nIt's confusing, now my fangs out protruding\nRebuking from mouths full of communion\nScorn by lukewarm kind, it's time you've been warned\nThe Storm formed, now find refuge in..."

I do\nDo you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife\nIn sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer\nFor better or for worse, \u2018til death do you part? I do\nFrom the words of a patriot\nI often fear that the sins in my past\nWill come back to haunt me\nBut the consequences are more than I can bare\nI feel that shit, this piece right here\nIs about what comes with fame\nAnd the struggle to keep family within a family\nI give you, this ring\n\n[Verse 1]\n(This ring)\nGot me a top notch straight hot fox\nWe sought rocks and the ewok slot was caught\nGot dropped two playing hopscotch on the block\nOught not twat plot yo' for hops knot I brought dots\n(This ring)\nHelp me remain sane, no damn games\nCame from bane to a changed mane\nNo cane thang refrain from gang bang\nSlang a praying brain reigns family fame, then came pain\n(Say hello to Tech N9ne!)\nEverybody wanna be down with a nigga\nWomen get a whiff of the money\nThinking of taking it from me\nThey get up in the club, giving the love\nThrowing the pussy full of liquor and bud\nBooty hopping around up in the mo\nGet to looking around\nEvery ho wanna lick a nigga low\nInfatuated with niggas with dough\nGet 'em in the sack and try to make 'em let it go (Tech N9ne)\nBe autographing bitches in front of rapping niggas\nWho think of having figures they get to grabbing triggas\nThey can't imagine villains when they come back and get us\nWe get to whacking niggas\nI ain't never wanted no parts of this\nI don't never want to break another heart for this\nWhy the devil gotta make it, why the Lord\nWanna make something that'll kill something so marvelous\n\n[Hook]\n(This ring)\nBrings demeaning demons in (G-strings)\nSongs we sing make 'em fiend semen and (Green things)\nClinging, dreaming, thinking of being (Mrs. thing)\nWith this ring\nBut if I wasn't Tech N9ne\nBitches wouldn't even wanna be with Tech N9ne\nIf I did no music then would you respect mine\nThis wedding band and music\nDraws a line between life and Tech N9ne\n\n[Verse 2]\n(This ring)\nWas supposed to protect a nigga, best for niggas\nWho couldn't stop having sex with bitches\nBless the missus, who stress to kiss us\nEven though we spend our checks with strippers\nObsessed with clitorises (This ring)\nMade a nigga feel macho\nCry for, lie for, die for, my ho\nNigga I go face diablo with a hostile gospel\nIf I can't have tres or cuatro, little vatos\nI'ma let a lot flow what they sell, up in osco, up a nostril\n(That sound like Tech N9ne)\nNigga where the weed where the\nMuthafukin' blow and the hoes? (Yes, yes!)\nNext to me is ecstasy asking me if I wanna roll (Yes, yes!)\nBitches never gave a fuck about a fling, makes it exciting\nWhen a married nigga wanna fuck around\nAnd bitch know he's down for the fling (Yes, yes!)\nI've been tested and a lot of times been invested\nDidn't know this Tech's shit\nWould constantly get a nigga molested\nBeen approached by some of the best tricks\nIn the game and they came strong but I hanged on\nTo this ring and I hope my son don't sing the same song\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nQuincy J. told me, superstars are good providers\nBut two times out of ten when we're on tour family's not beside us\nWhat can a nigga do when he makes ends\nAdd more to the time they spend\nWhile he make ends, everything else breaking\nAnd the bond at the house may end\nAnd your wifey steady yellin' 'bout quality time\nAnd you think, with all the fame and fortune shit oughta be fine\nBut what happens when the divorce papers just gotta be signed\nAnd you lose half and your children 'cause you gotta be N9ne\nI wanna relax with them and spend time to the maximum\nBut if silence is golden, then me making noise is platinum\nI gotta be Tech and daddy and hubby\nBut music, women mixed with family's ug-aly\nI know and you know that hella be\nHot for a nigga's infidelity, but until then (What)\nGod, forgive me for any promises that I broke\nFamily, can I be forgiven for all the liquor and weed that I smoke?\nWhen I succeed, will I cope\nWill I still breathe without both\nThis ring (Tech N9ne)\nI don't know but when I go I'm leaving out dope\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "(Welcome to Killer 2)\n\n[Intro]\nIn my brand new Benz, thinkin' 'bout my so-called friends\nAnd why should I make amends when they crossed the N9na\nAnd sin again and again and again?\nI love 'em dearly, but hear me, they burn severely\nI'm weary to the point that I really don't want not one of them\nNone of them near me\nDid trust you, but what's new for real?\nYeah, I love you, but fuck you for real\n\n[Hook]\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)\n\n[Verse 1]\nMet you at a rock show, November no Octo'\nTook pictures then locked your numbers and then got low\nCalled you up a lot though, found out that you not ho\nSeveral trips to my show, shot me with your crossbow\nWe used to kick it in packs, whites and blacks\nTriple stacks and fat sacks, we matched, we relaxed\nTo kiss but I never twist her, she wished for the better mister\nI mixed the lady with my kid brother and miss, she became my sister\nFor a minute but then my lady started receiving that snitch\nBy the nigga on tour, you wanna be the reason that split\nYou started believin' that bitch in San Jose\nYou gripped what the damn ho say\nYou flipped like a man will stay, no trips, never Saint-Tropez\nWe dipped, used to play for you, even used to pray for you\nNever dap 'cause you wanted to spit in my face\nIt was up, up, up and away for you\nI hate this, I was real, so why fake shit?\nYou lost her, so go fuck them bitches on MySpace, sis\n\n[Hook]\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery show was a different face\nBut these two were from a distant place\nFollowed my tour got a quick embrace\nNever would have thought I had to give them space\nFather and daughter, loved me to death\nNever cared that blood be the set\nJust lovin' the Tech, shrugs in regret\nWhen I found out papa kinda had the husband effect\nEverybody seen it, but I didn't believe it\nEverybody got it but never did I receive it\nHis dream was for me to fuck Miss Thing\nBut she looked fifteen, baby girl was nineteen\nBut instead of givin' her dick I rather give her ice cream\nNow I'm trippin' 'cause her pops just tried to auction her off\nBut it turns out that he was knockin' her off, I had to stop and I cough\n'Cause that daddy turned out to be the boyfriend\nGuess he was gettin' him a little bit extra when he brought the toys in\nYou lied to me, did it fuck wit' the N9na? Sure it did\nY'all made me question what your motive is\nDon't cry Ally, but my temper was flared and scared also\nTo see you guess I'll see you in the crowd like Where's Waldo\n\n[Hook]\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you\n\nI wrote this carefully\n\n[Verse 3]\nI love you 'cause you married me when I needed therapy\nLet me move in with you be my wife, you wasn't scared of me\nBut fuck you because you say, if you don't get a job today\nBetter kick rock wasn't hard to say when you knew I rap my heart away\nI love you 'cause you sexy, love you 'cause you beautiful\nLove you 'cause way back in the day, you thought that I was suitable\nBut fuck you, you treated me, stupid and conceitedly\nI wasn't very smart, but a genius you wanted me to be\nI love you 'cause you strong, I love you 'cause you're real\nBecause you forgave me when I cheated and popped them pills\nBut fuck you for bringin' up shit that happened years ago\nChances of us gettin' back, it's gonna take a miracle\nYou live in the past, I'm givin' the gas and cash\nHow many niggas do that without you givin' the ass?\nAnd I ask you what other nigga, would step up with the love to give her\nG's in the house for you and the kids and even for your brother nigga\nEnjoy the dough you get, 'cause I don't owe you shit\nYou was unhappy with me, so you split\nYou need to show me some love, ma, and I don't mean that I wanna fuck you\nJust acknowledge me takin' care of you because I'll, I..\n\n[Hook]\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)\nI love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you\nI love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)\n\n[Outro]\nVerse one, I ain't never spoke nothin' but highly about you\nBut you gonna believe a bitch you never met, that's hardcore shit baby\nVerse two, I mean, y'all lied to a nigga\nI mean, that was foul shit you did, man\nI don't know what the fuck your motive was\nBut it hurt me real bad 'cause I trusted you, motherfuckers\nVerse three, I know I fucked our marriage up\nBut you can't live in the past\nYou either gotta let that shit go, or let me go"

I know somebody's\nAll fed up and off in the brain, heartbroken probably\nI been broke when life was not gleaming with hope and foggy\nBut I would never dump it on you, then later say sorry, ayy\nIt be the hardest when a loved one's life isn't starlit\nWhen they call you, they think the smartest way out of it is depart it\nYou tell 'em that shit retarded, and hate the call even started\nKnow they heart isn't guarded, not even your art is cathartic\nPlease think about your people, yo\nEase on about your ego, bro\nThat's about far as evil go\nYou don't really wanna fly like an eagle though\nBut in case you wanna know how sin taste\nI wanna try to help another, save a brother from a grim fate\nHow could you make friends break down and act like an ingrate\nSelfishness, that's what it is\nWhen all your family and friends just wanna see a brother live\nBut if you don't see the gutter through, you're gonna leave the others blue\nYou make it hard as fuck for us, but think it's easier for you\nDamn\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nIt's easier for you, yeah\nTo take yourself away from things we all go through, yeah\nBut if you knew that it was killing me, yeah\nIt's killing me, would you?\nWould you still believe that it was easier to do? Yeah\nWorld ain't never been easy\nDon't lay down, lay down\nDon't lay down yet\nDon't lay down, lay down\nDon't lay down yet\n\n[Bridge: Jelly Roll]\nOnly the angels know the pain that you hold on to\nWhy would you leave me 'lone, just 'cause it's easy for you?\n\n[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]\nI know somebody that's stuck down on the bottom\nAnd he deals with his problems in ways that never solves 'em\nAnd I know how he feels inside\nTry to give him flowers while he's still alive\nI see demons in my sleep\nGot a teardrop falling down my cheek\nDon't lay down, homie, you can't leave me now\nI woke up in the middle of the night, I was drenched in a cold sweat, stressing\nI couldn't fall back asleep, so I picked up the phone and I sent you a message, and it said\nAfter everything that we've been through\nThrough the ups and downs, just know that I believe in you\nYou said you won't leave me, I know I'm a piece of you\nSo don't you make this hard on us just 'cause it's easier for you\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nIt's easier for you, yeah\nTo take yourself away from things we all go through, yeah\nBut if you knew that it was killing me, yeah\nIt's killing me, would you?\nWould you still believe that it was easier to do? Yeah\nWorld ain't never been easy\nDon't lay down, lay down\nDon't lay down yet\nDon't lay down, lay down\nDon't lay down yet\n\n[Outro: Jelly Roll]\nYou\nIt's easier for you\nYou\nIt's easier for you"

Have you ever heard this album?\nEven if you know how the song ends, you will never know that I'm out of\u2014 my mind\nI'm above the law and I caused it all this mayhem\nWhatever you say when you speak is, childish crawl in the playpen\nEverything falls into place and, black gloves and a tight grip\nSittin' on a chest of my victim, if you breathe I'ma squeeze 'til ya lifeless\n\n[Hook]\nI want skin for my bed, spread\nI swear the sky just bled, red\nI buy guns with my med bread\nI'll take them to my bed, dead\n\n[Verse 2: Godemis]\nI might've gone AWOL, maybe I blurred the line\nClock radio alarm set, I know it's murder time\nI gotta find my mind, even if only a piece\nI'm better off behind, down here where we know no peace\nAnd the clouds don't move when the wind blow, put a seed in the soil but it didn't grow\nThey say I gotta odd sense of humor, killer clown sittin' still by the window\nCuff links and a crimson cape, scepter with my lipstick smudged\nI got a glitch on my headpiece, somebody come and fix this bug\nGotta protect the king, follow a black shogun\nCover the neck in bling, swallow a black hole sun\nLookin' down at my shitlist, wonderin' how did it get so long\nI'd rather be the one pissed off, than to ever be the one pissed on\nAmen, I'm an animal inside, feedin' on everything in the open\nI've been caught with a loaded weapon, red-handed the barrel still smokin'\nAnd I'm hopin', that they waitin' for me to break a leg, I'll be takin' the cast off\nTryin' to wash away all my sins, in the shower with a handful of bath salts\n\n[Hook]\nI want skin for my bed, spread\nI swear the sky just bled, red\nI buy guns with my med bread\nI'll take them to my bed, dead\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nSmellin' like Hugh Parsons, to get a victim when it darkens\nThen I'm hit them with a jargon, fuck her with no rubber\nThen burn a bitch, I'm an arson(ist)\nThen have a lot of drinks 'til I'm barfin'\nWhen I went to do the verse for The Martian\nHe told me to put the people up on the milk carton\nKeep a knife sharpened then he laughed like Cartman\nI got stigmata markings, pardon when the beast get the bar end\nI put the, I put the evil in my art when the angel let go of me\nAnd took what the demon bargained\nI'm gonna make a change but I'm Harkin\nIf you cannot tell me when the sex startin'\nI got the kind of heart in spartan and I'm enemy scarfin' then I watch Johnny Carson\nIf you think I'm harsh then, Strangeland not the place to be parkin'\nI guess this is the part when, I tell them all that I'm part hen and part sin\nReading about Noah's ark, eating carp and the book is so colorful gotta listen to Darwin\nBecause you like a perfect margin, and that makes my dick harden\nSo I'm comin' over with the sparklin' (wine), get to itchin' when it's carvin' (time)\nAin't no matter what the guards in (line), ain't nobody's 'bout to stoppin' (N9ne)\nI'm so twisted, I think I created the water, our women and our men\nThinkin' they're gonna take it for a swim, so now I got to throw the sharks in"

Ain't this night?\nAin't no possible way that I can paint this bright\nWhen the brain is night, mane it's quite\nDifficult to be with Tech, ain't a dame this tight\nOr is it? You gotta live it to give it\nI'm giving you me, if you wanna quit it, I dig it\n'Cause I get a pussy pass every minute\nBut then it's a fight 'cause you thinkin' I'm all up in it, we finished\nNow we diminished, I get it\nSee the obstacle then you really admit it\nWithout knowing I ever did it you split it\nI was real, and don't you ever forget it\nYou bit-itch!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nBaby, this is something that you never knew\nInstead of me, you being with a regular nigga might be a better view\nI know I got a lot of cheddar, true\nBut a nigga with hella time in your bed is who you should be putting way up on a pedestal\nYou being super happy with him instead of blue\nBut you wanna see shit that you never seen\nMy dick is feeling like you taking methamphetamine\nThat's why when I'm calling your phone you never let it ring\nEven when he's sitting next to you, I bet it sting\nYou wanna ride it, your hide is divided\nBy my two thumbs, I murder it when I get inside it\nHit it 'til you get it, then get the itis ignited\nAnd you tripping you can't fly with the pilot?!\nI can paint you a beautiful picture\nBut I think it's better when you got a dude with you\nSitting at home, but then you got a true fixture\nYou fucking perform because he got it through scripture\nI'm a compatible nigga to every woman with incredible figures\nTattoo my dick on him, is that a new stigma?\nIf you say that at music I ain't gotta do with ya\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it"

Now I'm 'bout to do it my way!\nI don't give a fuck what y'all think about me!\nCall me devil worshipper, nigga\nYou think that shit was bad? Listen to this, motherfucker!\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nHow do I describe my pain?\nIt just rains and it brings at the same time flame\nI am bane, insane in my veins\nNo restraints can chain or contain me, I'm dangerous\nWhen I gave you my light it was wrong, wasn't right\nAnd no love was in sight when I need it\nSo I run with the night and the songs that I write\nIt be vile and it won't be defeated\nIt's jet black in my brain\n'Cause the hatred you gave me has turned me to twisted\nYou don't like this \u2013 suck my dick\nAll the kids with the sickness been waiting for this shit\nI wanna get into the mind of your youngest\nFill it with fungus and grow it 'til it's humongous\nPsycho alumnus, the tip of the tongue slit\nUrging the punk bitch: Eat shit from your dump pit!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nEveryone, are you ready for doom?\nBecause I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon\nI bring gloom when I step in the room\nWith the fumes of a tomb I consume all the light in the day\nEveryone, are you ready for doom?\nBecause I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon\nI bring gloom when I step in the room\nWith the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away!\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nI've got this cloud inside, it's consuming my mind\nAll the brown in my eyes are dissolving\nInto the whites of my eyes, now the night will arise\nAnd I'm hyped 'cause the beast is evolving\nStep into my dreams, lot of bleeding and semen and green rotted demons\nAnd they feed their seeds collard greens\nFull of feces and cheesed pieces of human cerebrum this evening\n(Stay away) 'Cause everything I touch turns to mold!\n(If you want me) Everything I fuck straight explodes!\nAre we there yet? Are you scared yet?\nYou got a pussy in your pants, wanna share that?\nLet me in, I'mma rip it then I'mma tear it out\nI'm tryin' to eat a bitch, where her motherfucker hair at!?\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nEveryone, are you ready for doom?\nBecause I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon\nI bring gloom when I step in the room\nWith the fumes of a tomb I consume all the light in the day\nEveryone, are you ready for doom?\nBecause I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon\nI bring gloom when I step in the room\nWith the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away!\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nHeat swells, details\nEverybody eat nails, sleep well\nHeld a gun, I come to attack everyone\nYou little crumbs, all are done, I'mma blacken the sun\nI'll banish it, damage it, can you manage to vanish?\nCut you like Anakin, manic man, damn it, and it's no panicking\nWhen I eat your soul, he's north pole\nThat means I'mma be more cold, freeze more soul, 40 below\nPiss, Lav, and Cuervo, plus habenero, now chug it!\nBurn their head to their toes!\nI will not spare those, I love it!\nThis is the result of you, thinking unclear, callin' me weird!\nThinking I'm a devil so you niggas don't cheer!\nI don't give a fuck what you think of Tecca Nina this year!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nEveryone, are you ready for doom?\nBecause I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon\nI bring gloom when I step in the room\nWith the fumes of a tomb I consume all the light in the day\nEveryone, are you ready for doom?\nBecause I've blackened the sun and I've bloodied the moon\nI bring gloom when I step in the room\nWith the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away!\n\n[Outro]\nThis fun house is crazy\nThere's through doors here\nYou guys go through those doors and I'm gonna go through this one and I'll meet you on the other side\nWow, a big red music box, I gotta see what's inside"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nYou can't stop what's divine, no\nSo why in the hell are you trying for\nThe Cayenne flow got you dying slow\n'Cause my info got the Zion glow\nThey don't like seeing Tecca the N9ne go\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nThey said I'm evil\nThey said I'm totally demon in my cerebral\nThey callin' me criminal, comin' to curse a cathedral\nTo punish the positive, opposin' the peace of the people\nThey said I'm a dreamer, and not a good singer\nThat'll never get bread and no kind of Heaven'll bring ya\nWhen I lessen the N9na\nOppressin' the Tech and left in the ringer\n'Cause I am the effin' best with the lingua\nCalling me failure when you know Tech is a choppin' impaler\nIt's funny when you rolling, they come and try to derail ya\nThe tale fell to hell bruh\nNothing you tell her is stopping me when I nail her\nShe loving the delta\nThe hate gon' show but the faith gon' grow\n'Cause I am a winner and gonna make strong dough\nWhen I take on flow, when the pace don't slow\nIt's comedy saying that Aaron Yates won't blow\n(Yates won't blow, Yates won't blow\nYates won't blow, Yates won't blow)\nYou did this, how you live with the stupidness\nKnowing when I get loose, it get lucrative\nWho can sit through this and boo 'cause it blew to bits\nDoofus is not a muse, it's a duplicate\nRiddle me, riddle me, yo why does a little league\nIn second fiddle belittle me when it'll be literally\nKilla B's on the milla spree to drill 'em and filler flee\nAin't no illa G, reala B, the skill is agility\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nWhen they be itching to down ya\nThrowing the hate all around ya\nTo all the people that clown ya\nBut not a sound when they come encounter\nA real one, they don't feel none\nSwear you're sitting on just little crumbs\nWhen you really making multi-millions\nWhen they say you lost it, but the deal's done\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\n\n[Verse 2: King Iso]\nIt's crazy what haters say when creating a narrative\nI will flatten 'em all like they ain\u2019t put no air in it\nMedia maybe is airing it and made a few errors\nIt doesn't matter, money\u2019s made and many take and are sharing it\nNobody's thinking about the way that they carry us, they are precarious\nFallin' like the angel that flared up and hated comparisons\nWhen I think about native Americans being named by some terrorists\nI ain\u2019t say it in Arabic homie!\nI figured I could make it apparent like babies in carriages, but this ain't related to marriages\nWhen I say I'm separated from a lady that merited liberty later that buried it and made me a heretic\nThey are taking our heritage to the grave\nInnocent but say we're nefarious, now we hang\nBut them people are fake as a fairy is on the gang\nPut a target on their face then I can 'em like it\u2019s a bang (ugh)\nThey ain't prepared for this, I made it so there it is\nSo they throw the shade in areas grayer than Meredith\nTuck a .50 for the shade like Anastasia, I'm airing it out 'cause\nLiving nowadays man it be stranger than Aaron is\nThey paint you in this light and try to make you a derelict\nGrammys ain't giving any love to Strange and I'm very sick\n'Cause N9na's on the throne but then he say I'm heir to it\nFake ish won't fly like a cape with a tear in it\nDemons swinging low not at your face, call them sweet chariots\nYou know how many people that grew up and they don't say what their parents did?\nGood could\u2019ve been that, but it could\u2019ve been bad, so your beliefs be careful with\nI'm sitting in the nuthouse looking at my freaking therapist like\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nWhen they be itching to down ya (ayy)\nThrowing the hate all around ya (ayy)\nTo all the people that clown ya\nBut not a

Conversation my name get brought up in\nI'm Woody Harrelson, this industry is Zombieland\nYou wanna fuck with us, you must've had no common sense\nI'll kill you then your guts get eaten up by Brotha Lynch\nIt's Strange Music so the competition nonexistent\nAll them other record labels fallin' off like rotten limbs\nI'm making some money, it's making their stomach cringe\nI'll never forget it, a couple of summers ago, I was cooking and scrubbing pans\nDrink 'till I get drunk and spin\nPuffing something with a lovely scent behind the Cutlass tint\nFloating in the Strange stream, who jumpin' in?\n\n[Verse 2: Prozak]\nMy brain is full of thoughts that are darker than Samhain\nThat span across the Great Lakes and vast Midwest Plains\nSpreading coast to coast like a virus you can't contain\nNow a global pandemic, panic courtesy of (STRANGE!)\nThe biggest independent label, pop the champagne\nWe don't need no head now, homie you can keep the change\nComing through your speakers, receive us into your blood vein\nWe the truth like Nostradamus' prophecy quatrains\nSnake Bat, Praise that, part of rap since way back\nSince the days of 8 tracks and 808's and adaps\nAnalog cassette decks, steady grinding, what's next?\nStarving artist 'til Trav and Tech cut me that advanced check\nStrange outcast step child, call me Damien\nFive Finger Death Punch straight to the cranium\nFlow so sick, could be enriched with uranium\nExtraterrestrial, lyrics labeled alien\n\n[Verse 3: Big Scoob]\nAppetite destruction, never been no punk shit\nMy voices give me choices, just to spite me I choose dumb shit\nChoppers all around me, I mean lyrical and literal\nSpit it through this microphone and pull up at ya mami's home\nJump out on the dumb shit, speaking through this drum clip\nTearin' flesh, rippin' hips, watch me kill shit\nCypher without the villain, that's appealin' but it's silly though\nAn army without it's general, an octopi no tentacles\nNot trying to be subliminal, nothing I do is minimal\nHeavy hitter, heavy words, push a nigga, pushin' verbs\nSquish my button, you push my nerves, ten toes in the turf\nNot the last or the first, gutta nigga, stomp the Earth\nGrippin' metal, I ain't special, on the level\nSmack your temple with the barrel, not complying, I'm a rebel\nAnd I'm fresh up out the ghetto, puppet master, I'm Geppetto\nTake a minute, you'll get it, nigga, Scoob did it\n\n[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]\nKali Baby! 'Ight man, I'mma do this! I'm kinda nervous\nThe purpose of having a cypher is so you can sit here\nWide-eyed, listen, look at me in this position\nNow, I coulda just left you sitting there\nBut Nina told me to pick 'em apart, you're a victim of art\nK-R-I to the double crooked, look at him\nHe pudgy like they took a ugly stick and frickin' shook at him\nAnd I don't stay Gucci down to the linens\nI'll let you trick off, she jerking my dick off and grinnin'\nYou can see him, but he just a figment\nYou wanna be him, better get your pigment gone\nTry to beat him with deliverin'\nI get belligerent and it's the end of the song\nAnd I get a little bit ahead of myself, feel like I'mma melt\nAnd I feel like I'm better than everyone else\nI guess I be rappin' ahead of my wealth\nI'm the coldest thing since the ice cube\nOnly thing missing from this beat back in the day was Ice Cube\nYeah, I said I'm the best in a minute, nigga what?!\nOnly niggas that could contest it is rested, dig 'em up!\nOkay! Hahahaha! Whatever, nigga..."

It hurts (What?) It irks\nFlyin' but I'm sickened\n'Cause the crazy things I'm thinkin'\nGot you sleepin' in a hearse\nMy brain is cursed\nClosed in this hell but my soul isn't stale\nIsn't failed, so sinister, got a ghost in the shell\nWhy did it fit so perfect when I was young?\nI didn't cry when it hit me like\n\n[Chorus]\nI caught crazy\nAnd I plan on keepin' that shit\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nInside of me I do believe this sits (Forever)\nI caught crazy\nAnd I plan on keepin' that shit\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nInside of me I do believe this sits (Forever)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you ain't some type of crazy, you ain't shit (Facts)\nYou keep the fake in front then push the real shit to the back\nThe point I'm tryna make is if you're fakin' that is so shady\nBut my crazy 'gainst yo' crazy? Whoa, baby\nCatch it then you're very grim like no\nOther motherfucker, just rap to win, you bury them, die though\nThey gonna have to pack him and then carry him, aigh' bro?\nKilled him 'cause I'm an African American Psycho (C'mon!)\nI was born this way\nAnd a star was born that day\nCrazy and I love it\nEmbracing my loco\nSaving my life and I'm sharp as a knife when I'm rippin' and letting my flow go\nKeeping it 'til I die, but my music's forever gonna fly\nAnd I'm thankful that I caught it like\n\n[Chorus]\nI caught crazy\nAnd I plan on keepin' that shit\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nInside of me I do believe this sits (Forever)\nI caught crazy\nAnd I plan on keepin' that shit\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nInside of me I do believe this sits (Forever)\n\n[Outro]\nHell yeah\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nI ain't ashamed of that\nForever\nI'm proud of it\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nForever, baby\nForever\nForever crazy"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nIn this house there is no room for envy!\nThis is why we wear uniform!\nRacists, not welcome!\nRapists, not welcome!\nHatred, dreaded in this house!\nReady to fight hatred with love?\nJoin us!\n\n[Hook: Liz Suwandi]\nIf you come with me then I can show you\nWhere we'll take you, where you dare not go to\nFollow me and let my mind control you\nWe'll rebuild this world that will destroy you\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nHow many wanna go? How many wanna know?\nHow to fight demons when the planet is gonna blow\nA lot of ammunition gotta be packing a lot of dough\nBeing together and it is wonderful\nA gun was loaded, one exploded\nSpeaking evil with the tongue he just folded\nFrom the Tech soldier, some get blessed over\nBums they come from straight under get swole\nI told ya, that I would die for my loved ones\nKill for my blood ones, beside a cousin\nTogether when the evil does come\nI question are you willing to plug one\nProtection is one thing you need\nTo battle any animal coming with greed\nIf evil try to penetrate us and feed\nSimple mathematics, demon you bleed\n\nI know this comes off violent but this fight's for love\nIt should not be this way but evil drew first blood\n\nPut the roman numeral nine on your inside\nRight wrist, so I can read it properly like this\nThat's how we know we together within the crisis\nAnd you don't need a lot of your money to buy this\nStay with me in the darkness when the light hits\nI will promise your family low prices\nA better war for boys and girls\nMight get a little dark and dirty before we get to the brightness\n\n[Hook: Liz Suwandi]\nIf you come with me then I can show you\nWhere we'll take you, where you dare not go to\nFollow me and let my mind control you\nWe'll rebuild this world that will destroy you\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nThe red is for the blood we all shed fighting\nThe black is for the nights we fight with no lighting\nThe white is for the clouds from which we came flying\nLanding in this jam with man and then began dying\nWe slegna see dread through these retinas\nWe beg to be swept up by the blessed head inspector\nBut all these hecklers don't respect the way we lecture ya\nGet next to ya, that's when the Tech get flexed in a watup who's next with us\n\nIf I happen to die at the end of my run\nPlease give all of my note books and guns to my son\n\nWhen the smoke clears I hope there's some folks near\nTo vote me as the pope here, not quote fear is not a condition and no tears\nThe new color is black clothes black boots and strings\nI'm gonna show these nonbelievers what mass lab producing means\n\n[Hook: Liz Suwandi]\nIf you come with me then I can show you\nWhere we'll take you, where you dare not go to\nFollow me and let my mind control you\nWe'll rebuild this world that will destroy you\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nThat's right!\nThere are people right outside these doors\nThat actually would attempt to be our oppositions\nSimply, because of the love we have for each other!\nThe love! Ain't that something?\nWe still have our daily jobs, we still pay our taxes, right?\nSome of y'all ain't paid your taxes but we workin' on it right?\nSo what do you think the problem is?\nThat we all dress alike? That's petty that couldn't be it\nThat we helped those in any kind of trouble\nThat's supposed to be a good Samaritan, right?\nThen evil is why we have friction!\nAnd what do we do to evil?\nO.W.H.H! (O.W.H.H!)\nOff with his head!\n(Off with his head!)\nOff with his head!\n(Off with his head!)\nOff with his head!\nThat's what I think"

This type of fire don't extinguish\nNow write about some bigger shit, you striking out, swing and miss\nRing around the Rosie, homie, pocket full of pain\nKeep a lock up on my lane and triple optic in my brain, look\n\nRinging\nUbiquitous: \u201cYeah, what up?\"\nN9ne: \"Ubi?\"\nUbiquitous: \"What\u2019s going on man?\"\nN9ne: \"Hold on\u2026 Travis is calling me, hold up.\"\nN9ne: \"What up, Trav?\"\nTravis: \"What up man, I\u2019m outside right now.\"\nN9ne: \"Alright, here I come.\"\nTravis: \"Alright.\"\nN9ne: \"Peace.

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nEver since my cradle date, or my prenatal state\nI was blessed with the gift to disable hate\nWith fatal takes on the mic is makin' my halo break\nAnd smash every lady workin' at Strange, call them my label-mates\nI throw the squad up, them I'mma pour ya broad up\nGenitals, so plentiful, ya chemical's low but shot up\nWishin' they'd slow the god up\nBut I ain't trippin' when I rip I'm twitchin'\nThey think that I be sniffing on Snow Tha Product\nBitch I might be, this a nice key, to get ya hyphy\nDick ya wifey, this for Ike\nSlice of sin or source if ya see somethin' slither slightly\nStep inside the surface of Strange, or simply sight-see\nSpit the flow, get the dough, then I hit the ho\nMister irresistible twisted is this kiss the toes\nI'ma kick ya nose if one of ya pricks oppose\nI'm all he hates, 'cause I became a landmark like Ollie Gates\nMaudie's great, tall estate, y'all debate, nigga, call me Yates\n\n[Hook: Marcus Yates]\nIt's no challenge, it's no challenge at all\nWhen you up the bar, it gets below average\nBelow average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em\nI'ma let you be great though (x3)\nBut it ain't no stoppin' a Yates\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nLately I've been like fuck rap\nWhat? Did he say \"fuck rap\"?\nOh no no, I'mma write in bold and plus caps\nFUCK RAP\nCause all these tough cats really don't have no nutsacks\nTrust that 'nuff scratch does back much wackness\nFlush that shit\nDown with the gowns with the sounds for the clowns\nAnd not in a good way\nYou can drown underground with the pounds\nWhen they gust that shit\nOh so, low we stojo, hoes and dough negro we flow though\nLet the soul glo, mojo, nigga\nPillowcase, over the head of the industry\nIllustrate, with my mouth and murders my ministry\nSeal the fate of my enemy, feel the weight of my energy\nI heal the hate. Facilitate. Disc jockey's with scrilla make\nThem play your records until you break\nRadio ain't nothing but real estate\nIt's still a fake deal of mates who ain't real awake\nBut the mill is great, ain't no iller ape that can kill a Yates\n\n[Hook]\nIt's no challenge, it's no challenge at all\nWhen you up the bar, it gets below average\nBelow average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em\nI'ma let you be great though (x3)\nBut it ain't no stoppin' a Yates\n\n[Verse 3: Marcus Yates]\nI can keep my head, while everybody losin' theirs\nNo Marcus, I told you, don't start this debate\nI'm all arsenal friend, we the median like, you feedin' me in\nTired of bein' with the intermediate\nFaded on bullshit, control the whole medium\nI done ran inside my meniscus\nI done out-rapped everybody Christmas\nSo why in the hell would I fail?\nIf I do, I'm just being Ezale\nFront line level, untamed, unchained\nAfter all this shit, I remain on lane, loser\nAnd that's what yo ass get for hittin' that snoozer\nMy brain is worth a few trillions, I don't get worked\nSo my verses hurts when they send me to kill 'em\nI'm like Biblin' niggas, keepin' it blacker than Power Rangers\nBut why the name Zachary? No leashes, I'm free sucker\nNo reachin' no knee deep into mine\nLike a comprehension of lines\nRevisit them when you wanna hear that real wizard dim\nYoung and timeless, elite science, prominent and flyin'\nAnd beat them beats to meet and greet but I conscience"

God said: \"Kill 'em all!\" Tech's back's to the wall!\nFightin' for my life and I'ma bust back 'til they fall!\nAnd I ain't even slangin' them thangs\nI'm hollin' one-eight-seven if you trippin' with Strange\nI'm really real with it, like my homie AJ say, \"Deal with it\"\nPushin' and pullin', fightin' for the meal ticket\nIn a minute I'ma do it like a villian, I'ma get 'em in the middle of a bomb\nPut 'em on the spot 'til the funk go pop and I bet he never have another quam\nTech Nizzle! When I'm thizzled it's, \"Who be you?\"\nRolling with Dave, Trav, Violet Brown, and 3DQ\nHootie hoo, for those who not knowin' that Missouli true;\nI'ma tell you like the Swedish would say it, \"Sug min kuk\"\n\n[Hook] (2X)\nAbsolute Power! That's the only way to roll!\nAbsolute Power! They love us everywhere we go!\nAbsolute Power! Tecca Nina's 'bout to blow!\nAbsolute Power! Absolute Power!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI do hip hop! And I mix it with the hard rock!\nDesigning this rhyming for climbing\nTech N9ne he's unwinding the shining is blinding\nGreedy so we constantly grinding\nI've been in the game 16 years making rap tunes\nRaising hella havoc up in the classroom\nNow in '02 you can watch me clownin', diamonds shinin'\nWatching DVD's on the Hoshitoshi (It's all Jesus!)\nNow I keep the crowds pumpin', they jumpin'\nGet back to the telly we rollin' and stickin' somethin'\nRacing to the main line\nAbsolute Power is having Halle Berry and Juliette Lewis at the same time\nOh! That's how Strange niggas run\nListen to the villian with the gun-associated tongue\n(We're close to the end) But not done\nThe Tech's just begin, begun, beginning to begin to have fun\nThe curse is tryin' to put me in the hearse\nBut I will not tumble, first thing's first;\nTook a lot of shit and I can't take more\nFuck Jay Ferus and everybody down with him and fuck JCOR!\n\n[Hook] (2X)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThanks to Strange Music I'm comin' and all my enemies they runnin'\nNow all my haters bummin' 'cause I was summoned\nWe Kansas City players and we 'bout soul game\nWe make it so Tecca Nina is a household name\nHow many points you got? I got 50\nHere's a question to the Censorship Committee\n\"Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?\"\nMy villians are gritty\nBig Scoob, Txx Will, Bakarii, rest in peace Short Nitty\nFoul with the evil ways, power's what the people say\nRebel yellin' we're felons and my pockets are swellin'\nThis beat's from Berlin, Germany\nThrowin' up Mizzizzy so ain't no other city concernin' me\nI teach it and I speak it very loosely\nStamina gunnin' got player haters runnin' profusely\nNow I got the parents pissed and ready to noose me\n'Cause they know that Absolute Power corrupts, absolutely!\n\n[Hook] (2X)"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nI don't even wanna fucking do this song, for real\nBut I wouldn't be real if I didn't\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI be sittin' by myself and I be thinkin', \"Momma, what have I become?\"\nAll I wanted was a family, but when I look up, you the only one\nLosing everything but money, everybody left and I don't even get to see my young\nOnly happiness I get is in the studio or when I get to do another run\nOn the road, doin' shows, get the woes, when it slows\nGettin cold, getting old, but the flows, gettin' sold\nI've been doin' this a minute but I think I wanna end it 'cause I'm on a higher level when I go\nBut the music I be doin', it be losin' 'em and make it really tough for me to grow\nAll I wanted was a family portrait, see my babies on a ranch with horses\nBut I was fucking devil bitches in corsets\nI was livin' really good then I torched it\nI'm sorry Ms. Jackson, I'm speakin' for real and I never meant to make your daughter cry\nBut I guess I'm a failure with women I'm lost and I feel like I ought to die\nFeel like that I'm rotting away, my life is just off in the grey\nHow much does it cost? I will pay, to lay, and be off in a coffin today\nI mean off in ashes, this life ain't after it clashes, If I get blasted\nThis is Suicide Letters all over again, I thought that I passed it\nBut I guess that I didn't, 'cause this one is written and there is no mending\nWhen I'm broke I'm a joke, when I croak I just hope that I won't be descending\nBut this ain't a joke, I want you to know that Tech Ninna is never pretending\nAlone in my bed, with a gun to my head, asking, \"where is my happy ending?\"\nYeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nTell me how it ends\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nWhat about me? Where is my happy ending?\nWhat about me? Is this a life worth living?\nYou know how it begins, but how does it end for me?\nWill I ever win, or does he have it in for me?\nWill this stop before I stop breathing?\nIs there light in this dark I'm seein'?\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nI put my life in this music, Nina is inside out\nI set my heart out for people, they know what the inside 'bout\nWill they keep feelin' Nina forever? This I doubt\nCan never cry for help, so if you listenin' this my (Shout!)\nI'm searching for the passage way to happiness\nBut i'm worldly so I have to lay in nastiness\nYes, this is Strange year, worldwide fame's near, but the game's queer\nSometime I feel like I'm Rudolph the Reindeer\nBut instead of a red nose, I stay in my red clothes\nAnd the music they said blows, is on top and the cred grows\nCan you resurrect a motherfucker that feel like he posses a dead soul\nDeteriorate to an inferior state almost equal to bread mold\nNow as my head goes, wish I could shed those\nBecause all the times the Nina was shorted, what I bled froze\nSo now that I'm cold blooded, and hella sick is what the med shows\nThe tread slows, and don't even think you reviving a dead rose\nYeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nTell me how it ends\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nWhat about me? Where is my happy ending?\nWhat about me? Is this a life worth living?\nYou know how it begins, but how does it end for me?\nWill I ever win, or does he have it in for me?\nWill this stop before I stop breathing?\nIs there light in this dark I'm seein'?\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nI'm on the verge of insanity, but I'm competent\nI'm breakin' so I pick this one to vent\nThe reason I look away when you talk to me my brain is producin' evilness\nI'm drownin' in 151 and Rumple Minze\nThat's how I feel\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI sit in the mirror with this gun and practice how to kill\nBut I know damn well that the people like me really wanna know how to chill\nThis life is about a check, about a number, about a bill\nThink about all the love I lost because my quest is about a mill\nI feel like you're stupid, don't talk to me I'm crackin' up\nAnd I don't mean laughter, I'm full of bitterness and it's backing up\nAnd I live with angels, but lately demons been shackin' up\nTug of war with my spirit, see the blood I'm hacking up?\nI love my kids and my fans inside I sob harder\n'Cause you pay the price for my life and it's right like Bob Barker\nAnd I won't pretend that it's okay I'm no facade starter\nSo I guess my only happy ending's in a massage parlor\nYeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nTell me how it ends\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nWhat about me? Where is my happy ending?\nWhat about me? Is this a life worth living?\nYou know how it begins, but how does it end for me?\nWill I ever win, or does he have it in for me?\nWill this stop before I stop breathing?\nIs there light in this dark I'm seein'?"

We were gonna play dead, roll over and add up losses\nDamn fools\nNo more playin' cool politicking with the rules eat fools in the carcass\nCause we back well season the leave\nAnd don't believe the vegan on sausage\nBut don't ride dick now, and act like your light bulb's lit now\nKeep signin' the killers and fat drug dealers really the big shit now\n(Take a big shit now)\nI gotta state these niggas be weak runnin' round like they nuts cut loose\nCan't even shake a nigga hand gotta dab a nigga up\nFuck around and touch butt fuck juice\nMayday to the pay day to they say we stay don't cut that noose\nYes, off with the heads then it's off to the bed\nGettin' head like duck-duck-goose (Awoo!)\nTechnicians form a petition to never ever let it up\nOn a rapper that sucks in this industry fucks\nWith a bucks that wanna hit and swarm from a duck\nCrystal meth, cocaine, e pills\nWith a little weed fill and a lotta freewill\nAdd a couple refills to whenever we spill\nWon't see thrills like these skills on a steep hill\nThat's some hott shit, that's hott shit\nOne more time, don't ride dick\nShit I got us creepin' on your level\nAqualeo now that's speakin' of the devil"

It's time to get into some sin you been listenin' to jibberish\nHits in the interim, them are done 'cause here me come\n(To make you stand up, stand tough, hands up, damn ya)\nIf you don't get it, get rid of it, trip if you diggin' it!\nI guess I got mo' than my balls and my word\nI got broads in a herd, chasin' this and all of my nerves\n(They've got the illness, they feel this realness, chill, bitch)\nI got a bed, it's too crowded for you to come get in it!\nI spit that Tech schei\u00dfe off to y'all\nIt's crazy! Even Michael Jackson said it's \"Off the Wall\"\n(I'm with the sickness, big Tech's lidless, Midwest)\nI be the best one for gunnin', nobody can get with it!\nSo when you see me in the spot: bow down, trick\nI eat, drink, sleep, dress, look and sound rich\n(So jump up, get pumped up, crunked up, everyone must)\nStop with the jealousy with me, the haters be riveted!\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\n(K-I-L-L) E to the R, a dot!\nJust ain't fair that when I pop up the spot be like, \"YEAH!\"\nKiller, killer, it's the gorilla\nAnd if they feel ya they screamin' like\n\"Yeah!

Deuce Clique, and guess who's with\nTwo chicks (Tech N9ne!) In my lou of Caribou sips\nThe super dew lifts, everybody in the party will lose it\nVodka and Mountain Dew is the new shit\nThanks to IcyRoc and Demonica, we honor ya\nAnd I get so much money sometimes it feel like I'm wearin' a yarmulke\nYou cannot monitor my money, I'll monetarily astonish ya\nSo what's with the bad comments and all the drama for?\n(I can produce a picture, stop with the truce and hit ya\nI'm at the top, but I can be poppin' and shootin' with ya)\nChip on my shoulder now, \"Mr. Nice Guy\" is over, wow!\nTo a ritzy and older style from ditsy and Gomer Pyle\nLook at my checks swell, chicks with wet tails\nReady to rock it, in my pocket got the Trojan Magnum XL's\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\n(K-I-L-L) E to the R, a dot!\nJust ain't fair that when I pop up the spot be like, \"YEAH!\"\nKiller, killer, it's the gorilla\nAnd if they feel ya they screamin' like\n\"Yeah!

Killer in and remorse is out!\nFuck Mark Cerami, you heard that from the horse's mouth\nThat ain't comin' from RBC, that ain't comin' from Fontana\nIt's comin' from Strange Music's Dontana in a calm manner\nI'll say this in baritone, (\"We come to get our cheddar!\")\nHuntin' you in yo' dreams, you wake up screamin' in falsetto\nMTV clipped me, birthday bash show\nI got fans like cat castro that'll boost my cash flow!\nMTV, completely, we sick of it, you won't give a bit?\nJust look at my eyes and my blood and my ligaments\nYou can see that Tecca Nina don't give a shit\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\n(K-I-L-L) E to the R, a dot!\nJust ain't fair that when I pop up the spot be like, \"YEAH!\"\nKiller, killer, it's the gorilla\nAnd if they feel ya they screamin' like\n\"Yeah!

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nYo, what's up?\nFor those who don't know, I go by the name of Tech N9ne\nI'm gonna let you in on a little secret\nSome of the things already known, that are familiar with me\nAnd my thoughts, so these are the real thoughts\nI'ma share with you, like this\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nDon't you come near me 'cause the Devil's sittin' next to me\nI drink my drink, and smoke my weed and pop my ecstasy\nThen add some GHB and mushrooms to the recipe\nThis means I'm really lettin' the beast within get the best of me\nIf you can hear me, I need help\nI'm caught and I'm stuck, and I'm trapped in me self\nDon't understand this fucked up hand that G dealt\nLazarus help me 'cause it's hazardous to T's health\nHe's set trippin', he's tryin' to get a nigga killed\nAnd get a nigga peeled, the otherside is gonna rid 'em in the field\nNo sentimental feelings, send 'em in the cold buildings\nI tried to tell him where you go you will not see your women and your children\nHe popped, fifteen hits of x in one night\nLicked big tits, had sex with some dykes\nAnd he won't use protection for my erection\nConstantly makin' me get that penicillin injection\nWait, I hear voices, speakin' from inside\nI'm out front waitin', he creepin' and he hides\nI can't help but notice he's kinda stuck up, I'ma let it slide\nBut in the meantime shut the fuck up, and just ride\n\n[Hook: Laticia Naylor]\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nWhen I was younger I used to faint at the sight of blood\nNow that I'm older I notice that it ain't at the sight of blood\nNow the sight of blood equals the very first sign of love\nMenstrual cycles, feelin' like you right at your height of drugs\nBleed for me, baby, made your heart, rage\nFuckin' you makes me feel a murderous sensation, blood mixed with ejaculation\nCum bustin', bump heads 'til concussions, after we done fuckin'\nIf I can't get the spirit I've won nothin'\nI got children, and a wife\nHe's thinkin' of leapin' off a buildin', takin' flight\nBy now somebody should have killed him, end his life\nToo many motherfuckers feel him, in his mic\nSomebody stop him, 'cause he's fuckin' up my livelihood\nWith me trapped inside this psycho how can I be good\nTo my wifey, if it's remotely close to a punani\nHe's in it, a monster runnin' me back and forth\nTo the free clinic\nIf you a friend, time to say toodaloo\n'Cause ain't no possible way he can ever be true to you\nCancel your appointment to do the due\nIf he wants to kill himself, what the fuck you think he wanna do to you?\n\n[Hook: Laticia Naylor]\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'\nBrain deteriorating 'cause I'm X pill poppin'\nI got, more troubles whatever you got it doubles and triples\nAnd quadruples, havin' fantasies of eatin' nipples and noodles\nDrugs; take the pain away, used to have a lotta love\nBut now I fade away\u2014 The fact\nThat women love the music and they open they legs\nFor a psychopathic nigga that's so fucked up in the head, is beautiful\n(Told my parents this isn't suitable)\nDevil bitches'll learn (no!), gotta recruit a few\n(This nigga's gonna do me harm, I'm drugged up and I'm torn)\n(Look at this motherfucker he colored my hair orange)\nYou can't touch me, everybody loves me\nListening to my music, children are gettin' ugly\nIf I told you everything I was thinkin' it wouldn't be G\nTellin' you how many crossed my path, just wouldn't be me\nBut they know, 'cause they way low\nHow 'bout some X n fry n yayo, and fuck a halo\nA lot of Jim Beam, to have grim dreams would be healthy\n(Hey yo, I'm trapped, in psycho's body, can you help me?)\n\n[Hook: Laticia Naylor]\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\n\n{\u200b*Chanting by Krizz Kaliko until fade*}\u200b"

My life's a light sky...\nSo much love I might cry... Daah! Nice try!\nI'm an evil seed, in the day I sleep and the night fly\nG.A.Z.E. in my E.Y.E's and you might die\nI'm a horn dog, got a lot of that porn y'all\nWarned y'all, I was straight born raw like Orenthal\nBut I'm way worse because he was cornball\nI remember keeping him in my dungeon with a leather suit and a orange ball in his mouth\nI had some foreign broads in his house\nHow did they get twisted and torn claws when in bout?\nNine inches then I stuffed they dorn draws in his couch\nFor now I let 'em suffer in the morn' all then it's ouch\nI have a devil's haircut in my mind\nThat's why I be sucking blood and bustin' nuts in my rhymes, I'm horny\nSo don't ignore me if you're semi-fine\nMe and Gordy, Prozak love orgies and we in our prime and we\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nCan't hide the (Horns!) And I won't hide the (Horns!)\nI live with the (Horns!) So I'll die with the (Horns!)\nIf you fuck with the (Horns!) Then you'll get the (Horns!)\nSo if you want the (Horns!)

Then you'll get the (Horns!)\nSo if you want the (Horns!) Then I'll give you the (Horns!)\n\n[Verse 2: Prozak]\nSchizophrenic thoughts spin around my mind sorta like rotisserie\nSpittin' this wicked ministry to the beat of this Rebeck symphony\nWith a sin for me, separated by 6 degrees of greed for centuries\nAnd hatred engulfs my sensories like hallow screams from penitentiaries\nThis perpetual cycle of depression retention remains bottomless\nEven my psychologist said suicide may be the only option out of this\nAnd while the name Prozak and insane seem to sustain synonymous\nOne half of me wants to engage in the fame while the other half subsides anonymously\nA vigilante who sends deadly packages through the mail\nConfusing law enforcement agencies 'cause I write death threats in Braille\nWith somewhat of a God complex sending the Arabs to the depths of hell\nI warned you, you were forewarned, now witness thy horns unveiled\nI'm taking you on a hell ride so grab those safety belts and fasten 'em\nThrough the screams of tortured souls and eternal flames crackling\nRefusing to reap what you sow and wanna stop this all from happening?\nThis madness will continue until all of Stran-ge goes platinum\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nCan't hide the (Horns!) And I won't hide the (Horns!)\nI live with the (Horns!) So I'll die with the (Horns!)\nIf you fuck with the (Horns!) Then you'll get the (Horns!)\nSo if you want the (Horns!)

Then you'll get the (Horns!)\nSo if you want the (Horns!) Then I'll give you the (Horns!)\n\n[Verse 3: King Gordy]\nI'm in the desert sands of Bethlehem\nTrying to get Jesus to mate Mary in the manger and molest a lamb!\nDon't jerk yourself off Jesus, use someone else's hands\nSo where's those damn disciples he'd like to have some sex again!\nI guess Young Peter's receiving 'cause Jesus felt his ass\nChrist is an effin' fag, he likes to dress in drag\nBut hey, I guess his dad is just as mad\nGod woulda never had a sissy for a son, bet he's regrettin' that!\nBut yet we still ain't accept the fact\nThat he's fuckin' his mother and at the Last Supper he confesses that\nHe's an undercover male-lover and oh yeah Heaven's wack!\nHe don't want the Light, now I got Christ wearin' black!\nSee, I'm the Devil on his shoulder, yeah I'm that scary fat\nDemon that'll turn all you heathens into scaredy cats\nKing Gordy, the Anti-Christ, God Killer\nI am before and after Christ, I'm called a sinner\nMotherfucker!\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nCan't hide the (Horns!)

We have been so terribly betrayed\nSo my opinion is be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing suicide; it\u2019s a revolutionary act.\u201d\n\n[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nGrandma told me the good book said\nIn the last days get ready for the ten plagues\n1st, the rivers will be ran with red\n2, 3, and 4, dead frogs will 'cause lice and flies\nSick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives\n6, 7, and 8, a boil storms a fire and locusts\n9 is darkness, so dark it's hard for you to focus\nAnd 10 is death of the firstborn\nIf I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point\nTo get at me and battle me, maybe have this verse torn\nHow will this curse form?\nWell, Creationism and Darwinism been at it forever\n'Bout at it I got nothin' but hurt for 'em\n'Cause really nobody knows when you live\nThen you die where your body goes\nIf it's Hell or it's Heaven\n6 or the 7, well I'll keep the nina for all the foes in a gamble\nThat's what life is and it's hard to handle\nWhen the bible says worship this but the scripture's written by man though\nSo when man destroys us the word might not stand so\n'Til that day I'm just gon' protect my fam with ammo\n\n[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\n\nAnd at the height of their power\n(God) will send an angel to destroy them\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nI've been looking for something supernatural for a long time now\nBut I never got proof that a spiritual realm existed, wanted to find how\nEverybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?\nWondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king\nI know it sounds far fetched, every night I put knees on the carpet\nThen I pray to who's up with the star set\n'Cause the Earth in its self is a target\nFor destruction, for combustion\n'Cause there ain't too many you can trust in\nThink of all the women losing their husbands\nIn Iraq a lot of killing and suffering\nWhat I hope for, seemed folklore\nWhen the enemy kills and gloat more\n'Cause they killin' us off in this hoax war\nThen I wake up yellin' and my throats sore\n'Cause the fight's there, it's a nightmare\nIf it come to me, I'm in my snipe wear\nIf a bullet give my lung a slight tear\nI wanna believe that the light's there\nSo all you Christians don't get mad at me\nI just hope your mystical magical miracles work in catastrophes\nAnd this ain't blasphemy, but artillery is my strategy\nI hope for a higher power when I look at all these tragedies\n\n[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\n\nI will never follow the beliefs of man, why?\nBecause man destroys everything in his path\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nOh what a miracle, angels and demons\nBut the only miracle is that people keep believin'\nRight hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle\nKeep that for my rivals and evil disciples\nExpand your mission, man to women\nWhen they attack do you plan to give in\nOr do you do like I do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition\nPeople like us, piece and knife up\n'Cause we got evil to sweep and wipe up\nDevils and demons and humans, irrelevant\nSo if they lookin' deceiving I bust\nI hope that the higher power is watching over me\n'Cause we young people don't see faith like most the older see\nIf he or she is listenin', a mere sign can spark me\nBut if the laws in the bible are bogus, then prepare for anarchy\nWorst case scenario is never ever was a higher power\nSo in the midst of chaos now, the only real savior is fire power\n\n[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo, what about you?\n\n[Outro: Spoken by Jim Jones]\n\u201cI, with respect, die with a degree of dignity. Lay down your life with dignity. Don\u2019t lay down with tears and agony. There\u2019s nothing to death. It\u2019s like Mac said, it\u2019s just stepping over to another plane. Don\u2019t be this way. Stop this hysterics.\u201d"

to get to the money\n\n[Verse 1: Rittz]\nI've been feeling like Pablo in the Wells Fargo\nI ain't here to talk about a car loan\nPockets on my cargo shorts full of money\nAnd a duffel bag stuffed full, hard to keep the zipper on the top closed\nYou can barely pay a car note\nWhy you mad at me because your credit score low?\nI done gone broke but I bounced back\nLeaning on the counter while she look at my account\nCan I have a lollipop though?\nRunnin' game flirtin', with the bank teller\nI can tell she thinking I'm a cocaine dealer\nI got cash 'cause I rap, I don't trap\nI was hurting when I didn't have money, now the paper like a painkiller\nThe Internet say I'm worth four mil'\nIt used to be a way worse ordeal\nNo more Dollar Menu orders, eating four course meals\nThought I was a winner, look at what the scoreboard said\nForrest Gump in the end zone and kept running\nOn the way to make a milli you can bet on me\nYou sitting still like a crash test dummy\nLike you got a check coming\nTryna flash, you ain't got Tech money\nYou ain't ever live lavish, tryna be Travis\nYou ain't ever built like that\nYou been living in a fantasy knowing that you can't achieve\nI'ma tell you real life fast\nKeep it real like that\nYeah\n\n[Hook: Frizz]\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy, ay\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nGet some big ones, shit comes, quick son ditch 'em\n'Cause they gonna get to begging from the rich one\nFor the money for tummy, booty, and they tits done\nCross yo neck with a razor\nFor the fetty when they see you livin' major\nHow they comin' for money ya job paid ya\nWhen not even one of them did a little bit of labor\nWith them brand new hunnids\nDamn you done it\nNot a way somebody can ever ban you from it\nHow can you stomach\nThe poverty I hit the lottery\nSo when you go in the pile can you plummet\nDamn you stuntin'\nOn the land when you expand the grands\nThey gonna stand who run it and the jam you brung it\nComin' from all the fans the Kansas City man do gun it\nTake all the paper don't let the paper take ya\nBig money maker you're gonna wait to vapor\nFrom all the haters they wanna waste ya\nLike a trip when they hit a gallon of J\u00e4ger\nOff with the money is why they shoot ya\n'Cause they jealous they makin' the shotty juice ya\nI ain't slippin' or givin' nobody boosters\nI keep the brim a hunnid 'cause Tech is a crowded poosta\nNigga, ay\n\n[Hook: Frizz]\nI'ma keep it real like a

new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\n\n[Verse 3: JL]\nLike a brand new hunnid dollar bill\nWhen they put the light to me they will know that I'm real\nI'ma get to the money\nBut I give 'em what they can build in it\nRock at the rigorous on the go without a chill\nWe two up, it's too much money to be made\nToo much money for me to ever be a slave\nToo much money for me to not wanna get out of the bed and go get it\nSomebody already gettin' paid\nIt don't matter if you rappin' or thuggin', be stackin' or pluggin'\nIt\u2019s either you are slackin' or pumpin', how bad do you want it?\nLook even if you hover at the oven and you wrapping a couple of 'em\nMoving two by fours like Jim Duggan, you buggin'\nIf you don't got the lucrative hustle\nLooking for loot producing part of productive 'cause you\nGotta be tough and plus you gotta do what you must do\nThrow it when you win, they will son the rustle\nBut I see hawks when I see these thots, and I read thoughts\nLet them wonder \u2018bout the bread\nHe financially flaunts 'cause he know what she wants\nLet alone fucks I give 'em the photo cred\nEven though I do collect the dough, I haven't changed yet\nNever quit, never sit waiting for a paycheck\nTo the paid jet, then get lifted like a weight set\nWith a loud pack, hit a chronic like a Dre set\nJay high that's a safe bet\n\n[Hook: Frizz]\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy, ay\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money"

And falling...\nLanding in an unknown place\nThe star creates followers from underground rap\nOn the quest to shoot beyond the stars once again\nThe star begins in Strangeland\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nGround zero, crowned hero\nBut ain't nobody ever heard the sound before\nI found me so\nCompetitive, I never get the credit back at it when it was clown and Lejo\nNow we pro, the brown people\nWas on it for the moment but they frowned at me fo'\nLayin' what I was sayin' didn't sound negro\nNow people 'round me low down when the beat go\nNever will I ever stop or quit what I'm doing\nI'm getting better, even clever, rockin' it then I ruin every competitor\nWe at 'em poppin' shit, I be chewin' 'em up ahead of ya, etcetera the\nSpeed bandits coming for ya, now he's making an industry sandwich\nCome enjoy the flow, we're takin' them in to see damage\nGunnin' boy, you know we shaking the finicky planet, we've landed\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWe've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!\nThe thoughts will reign on this planet!\nThe arts been painted on the canvas, you're helpless!\nWe've landed! The arms of fans have been branded!\nThe dawn of 6's and 7's! It's the start of musical madness!\nWe've landed!\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nShootin' for the stars, lootin' for the cause\nWho's inducin' puke and hootin' for the bars?\nYou get stupid groups of loose and juicin'\nYou for true, but you recruit the youth ignore bizarre niggas\nBut ain't nobody fuckin' with any of our niggas\nAnd if you trippin' under the Tecca there are millas\nAnd you don't wanna fuck with a murderous gorilla\nWar 'til the lord hit a scar, nigga, what?\nBitch, I'm at the bottom and I'm comin' to get at ya\nBetter get up in ya column and I'm gonna diminish you\nWhen I spit I really got 'em right in front of me timid\nAnd I want a percentage\n'Cause I fought for everything I got, it was not handed\nAnd nobody fed a nigga nothin' when I was famished\nI'm bussin' for life and not for Nathan, but God damnit!\nNotice something beautiful just landed\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWe've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!\nThe thoughts will reign on this planet!\nThe arts been painted on the canvas, you're helpless!\nWe've landed! The arms of fans have been branded!\nThe dawn of 6's and 7's! It's the start of musical madness!\nWe've landed!\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI've landed six feet under six feet\nThe area where ordinary people can't sleep\nThe badness, we had this back in high school classes\nYou're dealing with three faces of madness\nNever been average with the image of a savage\nAt the very bottom I'm livin' under the maggots\nBut I'm 'bout to shoot up and really wake up the masses\nGas it and blast and have the upper class rackin' ashes\nUpper class rappers, sucker ass packers\nRougher tougher motherfucker spaz backwards\nKcuf Natas, gutter mad slacker\nTecca Nina's what their lads after\nEverybody I wanna say, \"What goes up?\"\nVertically movin', I know it's 'bout to blow up\nThinkin' when I hit the stars I'mma slow up? Hold up\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWe've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!\nThe thoughts will reign on this planet!\nThe arts been painted on the canvas, you're helpless!\nWe've landed!

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAnd just when they thought that everything was peachy keen\nSomewhere deep within the shadows\nThere were other things to be seen\nAn untamable beast with an urge to feast\nAnd only alone would he stand, the culprit of fear on the 67th tier\nThere lies the Boogieman\n\n[Verse 1]\nNo introduction needed\nN9ne times you must repeat it\nMind tryin\u2019 to just delete it\nI'm N9ne supposed to be this rough MC\nWhose gluttony would rhyme grime\nTrust, believe it\nA legend ever since the projects\nA odd tech would get respect\nWhen he wreck the set but never get the props\nThat was god blessed\nSo this is me, never lettin\u2019 the crowd rest\nThe object of rawness\nDejected steps to darkness\nLed to the industry whispering the name\nHistory became a mystery\nCause listeners in the game\nWish ta sing the same\nRiffs, cerebral glitch will lead to lame\nAnd this will be your pit\nFor me to split and bleed your brain\nThey heard the name\nBut can't put a face with it\nOh what a shame\nWhen it rains in the woods he stands still\nHe turns to lanes\nFrom sane to straight wicked\nDon't tell me you ain\u2019t heard the sayin\u2019\n\u201cThe Boogieman\u2019s real\u201d\n\n[Hook]\nHe's underneath your bed\nTrapped inside your head\nYou try to fight it\nBut you decide it's just that\nBoogieman\nWe fear what we can't see\nThis web\u2019s a tangled weave\nLife designed you\nTo try and blind you\nFrom that Boogieman\nAnd in that voice you hear\n'Eliminate your fears'\nWhat do you do?\nDiscover the truth\nThat it\u2019s the Boogieman\nAnd now you know it's real\nAnd everything you feel\nHits you again, you will stand\nFace-to-face with that\nBoogieman\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey don't wanna have to try to do as I do\nThat's probably why it ain\u2019t been easy for me to slide through\nI chew rappers up, on stage and they\u2019re like fly-flew\nOut with the ravens, flight to hatin\u2019, haven lies you\nCause you don't want change\nAnd you don't want strange\nRearranging the main lanes to brain games from plain jane\nThat's when your fame\u2019s Strange\nAnd you can\u2019t maintain\nYou think you sang such an insane rain\nSame thang\nAnd I'm the shadow in the dark\nThat came for battlin\u2019 the park\nAnd they skidaddled when I barked\nIt gave a rattle to their hearts\nCause they're afraid they will all fail\nDarkness will prevail\nThe Boogieman is not a tall tale\nWhat a tough act to follow\nYou afraid? Tell me are ya?\nWhen this came you were nada\nTell your lane \u2018sayonara\u2019\n(The Boogieman, the Boogieman)\n\n[Hook]"

(LET ME SEE IT!)\nThe newest member of the Drill Team, I'm on the prowl\nJust a whiff of the feminine scent I'm equippin' for infinite pimpin'\nIt's goin' down\nSee baby girl, I'll beat it up, and put it in a headlock\nWhen I snap and go primeval on that ass, makin' the bed rock\n\n[Hook]\nYou're one hundr-ed, we so hunterish\n\n[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]\nI'm a sexual predator, better alert the neighbors\n'Cause they desperate housewives is just my flavor\nDarth Vader, pullin' out my light saber\nAnd they like my hard candy, call it Now and Later\nSpear chuck of mutha (HEY!)

Some of 'em even an hour and a half. But a man gotta put in overtime for me to get off.\" Ha ha\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWork it baby\nI'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby\nPut a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby\nAll the time\nClock out, clock in for overtime\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nIf you think we 'bout to go to sleep - forget about it\nYou really doubt it, though we can make the synergys link\nIn the middle of the night I'm fixin' to enter the pink\nNever the one to be stingy. I leave my dinner, she winks\n'Cause she think she got me and her percentage be Brink's\nBut I'mma stick it without a ticket in the tender she thinks\nSuck me up then I can become her energy drink\nAnd that's what she gon' need\nPunching the clock, I'm not gonna be done on three\nBaby you probably wanna kick it and get her done on E\nBut you ever have steamy sexual fun on weed?\nSo I told her nein! No I don't look like it but I'm the older kind\nBut that don't mean I'mma stick it, n' quit it, forget it\nBecause tonight I'm 'bout to get it in overtime\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWork it baby\nI'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby\nPut a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby\nAll the time\nClock out, clock in for overtime\n\n[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]\nLovin' your body, lovin' your pace\nLove it when you maneuver your body off in my space\nAnd weather the chase, and have your body off in the daze\nAnd could you feel the hormones, they off the rage\nNow check it - let me take a little dose of the page\nI'm hittin' for hours and hours, hours hours and days\nAll the positions I'm feelin' real kinky today\nI've waited to play my trombone, have a parade (have a parade)\nKitty kitty kitty kitty c'mere\nWell there's a couple little things I wanna say in ya ear\nI'm shiftin' gears, love it when I strike the wheel\nStevie Stone in the bed, I'm a freak for real\nBaby girl I'm a freak for real\nA little too much tongue got me head over heels\nWetter the chill\nHead shot, ready to kill\nReady to deal, head rock, watch what you will\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWork it baby\nI'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby\nPut a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby\nAll the time\nClock out, clock in for overtime\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nBaby, baby, gave me a job and I love it\nI know you be lovin' the way I throb when you hug it\nWhen I got the poonini I thought the job really was it\nBefore the poonini you take the job and you shove it\nFeel like a nigga makin' love when I does it\nOn the clock I won't stop and when it buzz I'mma plug it\nGood enough for me to be your husband in public\nYou really be wantin' to pack a stud in your luggage\n\n[Stevie Stone]\nAh, pack a stud in your luggage\nBreak down baby, Stone gonna love it\nWhile we bangin' make a nigga wanna love it\nMake me wanna snatch it\nSee to it girlie, ha\nIt's one of a kind\nYou bring the girls and I'm comin' with the N9ne\nSpread them legs and open wide\nGive you that overtime\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWork it baby\nI'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby\nPut a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby\nAll the time\nClock out, clock in for overtime"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI once said in a cypher of famous friends back in 2011\n\"Who do I catch\u2014?\"\nOutside of Technicians' tunneled to Tech vision\nAt a point in time when dope is the new whack\nSo it's safe to say we're in Barney says Cheadle\nOn the outskirts of our army, we scare people\nBut it's not for evil, up with hawks and eagles\nBut I'm lost and feeble wondering if this restarts the needle\nLook around, do you spot Tech\nIn front of seventy thousand at RockFest\nBy the way he won the crowd does he got next\nTo infect the mainstream or sell a lot less\nGod bless my core fans still around\nWe're here 'cause you held us down\nLove the way that you love my sounds\nBut I'm still try'na break new ground\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nFeels like I could blow out a fire with one breath\nLook at the sky in the sun set\nSing you a song to change the mood\nAnd move mountains with my hands\nBut just don't understand\nWhy this needle just won't move\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nYes doing this for, yes doing this for, yes doing this for profit\nAnd my pocket's one dimension\nI wanna reach so many hearts and souls is my intention\nSince 2001 is when I started my ascension\nBut in 2015 I went up just to get honorable mention\nMakes me wanna end it, I get so offended\nWhen they speak of genre breaking but no N9ne is in it\nOr friended I'm winded, my music's intrinsic\nBut it's kinda looking like the needle ain't moving even when I did a killer with Kendrick\nJimmy Kimmel was splendid, four million attended\nBut when we were done it's like not one of them were mended\nMaybe it's my image and large amount of grimness\nMy pen spits on them scripts\nThinking I'm on a sin trip and then skit\nRock on the range we had 'em flocking for Strange\nBut it was a shocker when no rockers remained\nWhen it came to the game where they claimed\nFame could get you big as the Beatles\nYeah we got it this far but I really wanna push that needle\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI could blow out a fire with one breath\nLook at the sky in the sun set\nSing you a song to change the mood\nAnd move mountains with my hands\nBut just don't understand\nWhy this needle just won't move\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nPardon me Lucas\nI was blessed to do a song with Marshall Mathers\nI was thinking when the emcees hear this they hearts'll shatter\n'Cause the art's so radder than babblers with partial chatter\nBut the garble swagger actors win it all, but this?\nNot a chart no ladder, dark so daggered\nWhy do mega artists do this with me?\nMan it make me feel so good when they all really do skip the fee\nSlipknot, System Of A Down, Deftones, Doors got a few hits with T\nBut the one thing that makes me wanna say screw this and flee\nMan I did it all this when music is free\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI could blow out a fire with one breath\nLook at the sky in the sun set\nSing you a song to change the mood\nAnd move mountains with my hands\nBut just don't understand\nWhy this needle just won't move\n\n[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]\nNow they gonna say:\n\"Poor N9ne, please you're fine\n'Cause you made it to the Forbes List 'bout at least four times\"\nBut since I wrote my first rhyme it's been war time\nTo get the masses to see this talent deserves more shine\nSo this year I sat at my very first Grammys\nMe and my partner Travis watching my peers go hammy\nI thought about all the awards these folks should hand me\nMan I swear I'd disappear if it wasn't for fans and family"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nTurn me up a little bit Ben\nSo I'm just 'bout to spit some shit real quick\nIt's the last song\n'Cause I ain't got to the Promiseland, baby\nLet's go!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI remember when my soul, hoes and dough was missin'\nWhen I went to all the shows, yo my bros are bitchin'\nNever meant to blow my goal so it's motor spittin'\nAnd when I enter all of my flows I'm so in pole position\nI promised to be the best to mom\nGet us through, get up at the dawn\nLet Tech spew, flip it like an omelette\nEver since the calm bet you Tech ain't made you yawn yet\nI sign checks in my pocket are the color upon Shrek\nThe industry never passed the baton guess I grabbed it\nIf it's beyond us even so I get the gauntlet\nThis music shit was enough to make me vomit\nBut I kept you all astonished, make way for the KC comet\nNow I'm winnin', I'm more sarcastic than Vince Vaughn yeah\nHonestly when I walk in I come off like bomb threats\n'Cause them no want Tech to go straight 'nam vet\nThrow on jets and get all the way to this land that was promised\n\n[Hook: Nikkiya]\nLook at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury\nRolling down this road doing this thing\nThis is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)\nThis is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)\nWhat you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat\nThrough storm and rains with demons chasing me\nTo this promised land\nTo this promised land\n\n[Verse 2]\nWould you let me kiss 'em?\nCouldn't defeat me none\nWe started beastin' 'em\nSellin' records, millin' seconds\nLook at us teachin' 'em, yellin' Tech is hell and methods\nRippin' and reachin' 'em, felon jeffers tellin' heffers\nI ain't got no income but I got dough and then some\nIn come some friends, they wanna attend hundreds send 'em\nKnockin' 'em out, my chain go side to side just like a pendulum\nI'm in to one but the other is impatient waitin' for the sin to come\nThis is what goes on now that I'm in their light\nNow they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights\nBeen chasin this for so long, never has been fair fights\nLookin' for them rare sights, it's in there right?\nIn the land where everything is yours\nNot fictitious like the boars, all delicious like a s'more\nI'm be walking through the doors they often to the stores\nGot me bossin', doin' more for the Promiseland I'm you and yours, Nina\n\n[Hook: Nikkiya]\nLook at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury\nRolling down this road doing this thing\nThis is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)\nThis is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)\nWhat you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat\nThrough storm and rains with demons chasing me\nTo this promised land (Promiseland)\nTo this promised land (this is the Promiseland)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIs this it? Is this what it's all about man?\nEating, drinking, fucking, sucking, snorting? Come on man\nMeeting, feeling, touching, we on dames\nKilling, busting, really loving us 'cause we all strange\nHa ha ha ha ha I like it\nThe Promiseland is real simply because I write it\nDon't stare too long and envy 'cause you might get iritis\nNow to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices\nIn Promiseland I'm gonna stand an honest man\nThis honor gets the drama yes the llama can\nBring disaster on rappers like water on Japan\nHe got his chance and Tech puts it all on his fans\n\n[Hook: Nikkiya]\nLook at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury\nRolling down this road doing this thing\nThis is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)\nThis is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)\nWhat you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat\nThrough storm and rains with demons chasing me\nTo this promised land (this is the Promiseland)\nTo this promised land (this is the Promiseland)\n\n[Outro]\nStrange Music, baby\nIt's what we been waitin' on\nFor everybody to recognize the real shit\nIt's all happening, baby\nWe just gon' ride out to this, I love this beat\nYeah, we in the Promiseland, baby"

Do we kick ass with backwards\nAttacks ish like hap ut yrlived?\nCan you wait a minute?\nCan you slow it up a little bit N9na so I can get up in it?\nBut did you really wanna dabble in fanatical supernatural\nLyrically radical milli minutes? I'm about to begin it\nCan I get some? Can I spit some? Which one?\nWhen am I gonna get off this trip?\nCan I take another peel? Why do I feel\nLike I'm a sick individual in the room, poppin' off at the lip?\nDo you feel me? Do you do voodoo really?\nDid you get it? Do you want a real epidemic?\nWill you let me run up in it?\nWhat's the word? Is it absurd? What is that ish you heard?\nWas it real? Is it real? Was it really real?\nTech N9ne in it to win it besides QD third occurred\nWho's the worst? Who's rastafari?\nYou never livin', never sure it's Selassie, the first\nBrother on the planet Earth, who?\nDo you wanna flow? What you wanna do?\nHow can I be in the zone like this? Gone like this?\nHow can I break the obsession?\nIn the middle of it all, when I snap back, step back\nAnd ask myself; what? Why do you ask so many questions?\n\n[Chorus: Tech N9ne]\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nDo you understand? What you gonna do when N9na hit you\nWith the critical homicidal lyrical killer flippin'\nLeavin' you with boo-boo underpants?\nHow does it feel?\nDo you wanna come up and chill with an assassin?\nCan you feel it inside, what?\nThe feeling of a commotion of two titans clashing\nWhy me? Who are you? What I am supposed to do?\nWhat a nigga here fo'? Who do you fear mo'?\nIs it the N9ne with a brand new joint?\nLike to hear it, here go\nWhat are you lookin' at?\nWhen am I gonna get a dose of Thorazine?\nCan you give me a little something to ease the pain?\nHe's the mayn, who's the mayn?\nTecca N9na with the Rogue Dogs and the MidWestSide crew's to blame\nCan I get a little backwards attack ish?\nWhat do you accomplish, never can't you diss this\nPitless bottom of a, in you toss out nigga ass, Bade Mitch\nHater-playa percent hundred that is Side-West-Mid\nDown ever who off but aggin\nDid you know Tech N9ne hot like a dragon?\nDid you feel it baby?\nCan you give me a double dose of whatever?\nThe feeling I'm gettin' is really pain, Kobain\nFor anybody want a piece of this, sickness\nIs it a cinch to get with hot?\nWho? When? Where? What? Why?\nI'm at the pinnacle with a killer eye, do I wanna die?\nNo, I just wanna dose of the most inner syringe up in my thigh\nBonzai!\n\n[Chorus: Tech N9ne]\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nNow do you know what the real is?\nDoes everybody think I'm twisted? Non-realistic\nOr do you think that I'm gifted? I'ma lift it, yeah\nCan you help me? Am I lookin' at you?\nCould I be peepin' you from afar? Please, remain calm\nCould you be the reason I'm a bomb\nStraight out of Vietnam, ready to explode on Satan?\nTell me what the problem is, I'm alright where the bottom is\nDo you know what a empty column is?\nAm I your worst nightmare? I feel sick right there\nShould I blow it out? Can I do without? Do I need help?\nAm I living within a pen of demons?\nI'm stressing, can I get a blessing? (from who?)\nThe one who cursed me with all these questions\n\n[Interlude (only on Gang Related soundtrack)]\nSome say I'm psychotic\nBut if I have to label it, it would be \"confusion\"\nIt's like I gotta write shit like this\nTo keep my head from exploding, y'knahmsayin'?\nSo many questions\n\n[Chorus: Tech N9ne]\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace\nWhy?\nDo I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?\nWhy?\nAm I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace"

They can't stop they lust for venom\nBut you will not forgive me baby, you gots to admit we crazy\nBecause you bring me ya light and I'm just so dips and hazy\nMy heart is massive but they want my dick\nBitch, you ain't never felt no shit like this, so gimme a kiss\n\n[Hook]"

So we can stay in your race\nLay 'em on tape invading your state with this pain in your face\nWhat is the door slam? They ain't with the program\nThe bidness give a damn, you go HAM, you giving 'em more stamina\nWhat is having a manager bookin' many shows to go jam?\nWhat is at the bottom? They don't really gotta\nWhat is in a column without another who stopped him\nDropped him, popped and chop him, what is summer, spring and autumn?\nWhat is dope and to the top and shot him what is poverty?\nWhat is acknowledging a prodigy?\nWhat is the dichotomy of this good and bad anthology?\nWhat is lads that follow the sad path Sickology?\nWhat is livin' life low, then livin' like you hit the lottery\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is hip-hop\nIt's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop\nIt's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop\nSo ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop\nThis is hip-hop\nIt's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop\nIt's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop\nSo ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop\nThis is hip-hop\n\n[Interlude: Tech N9ne]\nWhen I first heard the beat, it gave me the vision that if the\nMayan calender was correct and in 2012 the world was actually destroyed\nWhen a new civilization forms and they get to diggin' they find this\nAnd this will be a perfect way to start off the new hip-hop culture\nYou know what I'm sayin'? We're two murderers lyrically\nYou know what I'm sayin'? It'd be crazy\nStrange, baby!\n\n[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nWhat is gettin' off the X and writin' an album?\nWhat is being put in the middle like Malcolm?\nSicker than sarcoidosis\nI eat Carrion, I got body parts in my Carry-On\nThat's when the party starts, nigga, I'm very hung\nBeen rippin' up niggas since I was very young\nScary-lookin' motherfucker, ready to kill your daddy's mom\nReady to eat that meat with a meat cleaver\nI creep in the streets and defeat these\nEat these niggas up hot shittin' out their feces\nPut a knife in their nieces\nAt least he's younger, hunger, dinner\nHe sees thunder, one nut in her\nHe sees baby, doctor visit\nHe spills rabies in his lyrics\nPut her in the back with the flat tire, I'm fire 'till I retire\nI tie her up and then fry her up and then give her to the higher up\nTech N9ne intertwine, get out the wine\nThis is my kind of hip-hop\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is hip-hop\nIt's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop\nIt's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop\nSo ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop\nThis is hip-hop\nIt's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop\nIt's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop\nSo ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop\nThis is hip-hop\n\n[Outro (Reversed): Tech N9ne]\nTo all my youngsters out there listening to this:\nFind some sort of education or understanding of life and how it was\nAnd then try to find out how you can continue to grow this thing\nAnd better this thing and take this thing to higher heights with\nMore knowledge and more conviction to preserve this thing called hip-hop!"

Can't we just reunite?\nI need a throwback to seeing you in flight\nYou had that down south body with a hint of death\nPicked you up and held you down, sound until I went to rest\nBut who needs rest, when the world is gone\nEverything is burning so I'mma just alert the globe and hurt you slow\nYou're known for fast love and vertigo, so I'll just\nPick you up and get a little intimate in a minute\nA cue for the return of a virgin soul\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Bernz]\nI tuned 'em out, I-I tuned 'em out\nToo busy turning on it dropping out\nBehind my, my mama's house, producing clouds\nNever understood my need to get numb\nMeanwhile I'm bleeding out my eyes\nHeaving out my lungs, trying to avoid the sun\nCurious at a young age for a taste, watching them numb they faced\nTill Caroline found someone for us to bring out on dates\nI call it youthful curiosity, jumped the edge every saturday\nStrobe lights and low lifes the city at night was calling me\nI turned 'em out, I-I-I turned 'em out\nHad 'em both kissing on my lips\nThen smoked the spliff to boost the trip\nLift off, I'm gone, phone call my bro, let him know that I'm lost\nAnd I got sand in my shoes from twilight beach - Menage a Trois\nHeavily sedated I, grew up with jaded eyes\nSee she's been friends of mine since '99\nBut now we don't see eye to eye\nCan't retrogress, unless life gets too heavy for my chest\nThen I be tuning out and caning dropping out before they win"

Unbomfortable\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel comfortable here\nComfortable here\nComfortable here\nI feel comfortable here\nComfortable here\nComfortable here\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nYo, I'm comfortable talking to Mark Alford\nHe don't make me feel I gotta kneel at a dark altar\nHis colleagues are cool, things are jolly and smooth\nAnything else, it'll be part stupid and part awkward\nDo your homework before you talk to a vet\nThat way you won't get no static comin' from Tech\nI'm on my own Planet, I'm in my zone, dammit\nI see a lot of you and wonder just how you drones manage\nYou niggas don't get it at all, the wicked\nYou get it delivered to y'all and give it a negative critic\nKnow when I spit it them people are giving the calls\nRequesting me, I'm blessed and free\nYou want Tech the G, you must step to me\nI ain't beggin' for no petty press, I'm already set\nDone a lot of work with Travis that made our fetti stretch\nEven though I'm Michael Myers, I still get steady checks\nBut yo when I'm slicin' haters I leave a Freddy mess\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nFrom Rocked Rhyme sessions, the top I'm steppin'\nBut I'm no longer steppin' in Hot 9-7\nTill the powers that be travel to see the spot N9ne's reppin', yeah\nComfortable here\nComfortable here\nComfortable here"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Makzilla as Circus Announcer]\nLadies and gentlemen, hurry hurry hurry! Step right up and witness the sad circus! Come one, come all, to the sad circus! Step right up and see the lonely poor bastard. Witness, the man with no hope. Stories guaranteed to be tear jerkers. Now without further adieu, the sad circus!\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI had so many plans, 'cause I got plenty fans\nI thought that I was never gonna be alone to spend these grands\nBut it seems that every girl that I dated somehow hated the way I loved\nAnd I mated with so many, now the ones that with it, it's not any; they all ran\nI thought that I was gonna be Hugh Hef, six women to go two step but not one of my crews left\nKids are growing up and they got lives now, nobody arise now\nUsed to be married but narcissism let my bride down\nI used to be a playa, I used to be afraid of bein' alone\nBut they all eventually said \"I'll see ya later...\" much later...\nSittin' in this plush lair, must say I'm stuck in a rut\nI guess not enough prayer\n'Cause ain't nobody came back, I bust the same raps\nBut ain't no dame pack, wish I could change that\nThey say that I'm extra, I'm messed up and I murk the deals\nThat I have with them in the past but I miss 'em and it hurts for real\n\n[Hook: Courtney Kuhnz]\nSee the man with the broken heart (He's just right over there)\nAll alone he stands so lonely in this world so cold\nAnd he's been hopeless from the start (He feels like no one cares)\nBorn alone, he'll die so lonely, saddest story ever told\n\n[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nSooner or later rumors that tear me up in pieces\nAnd he's just bad luck everywhere I go I'm sick of this steepness\nMore money more problems, no money problems gettin' worse\nHe don't have to get bloody but he didn't have to get hurt\nFuck I'm so tired of all this cryin' it don't work\nIt's affectin' my work, not even carin' about my worth\nThin line between love and raps, Strange got the fans comin' back\nBad plus bad run in packs, startin' to think is a curse\nI can't you do it without you nigga'\nCan't be done without me nigga'\nWell, yes it can, wait, please don't do it without me nigga'\nStrange move on without these lyrics, makin' it to where these fans can hear it\nI'ma have to get done I'm near it, Brotha Lynch Hung you can't be serious\nI'm starin' at these pills, in the back of the Cadillac, and matta' fact\nI got it I grip my steel, I'm always on this suicide thinkin' that's how I feel\nI figure if I get rid of these pills nobody would care if I'm killed\nMy label's on the road, me just sittin' at home, see\nSpittin that chrome, he gettin'that gold\nWe get that call and then we run in they house, gun up in they mouth\nJust know it's Madesicc Strange that's what I'm talkin' 'bout\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Makzilla as Circus Announcer]\nThank you! For coming, to the sad circus...come again...or not...hahahaha...\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nI'm falling, I'm crawling, I'm yelling but no one can hear me calling. I'm crying, profusely, sometimes I wish somebody would just come and noose me"

Shoot this dirty bitch\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\n(Sin with me; I warn you)\nShe Devil's in the house lemme here ya (Heeyyy)\nOff top I gots to get near ya\n\n[Verse 3: Kuniva]\nThis devilist bitch is so succulent\nTaking a piece of my soul every time\nThat I bust a nut she's like a succubus\nA nymphomaniac laying me back on the filthy mattress\nCum stains on it smelling like catfish\nStill I hit it, yeah I did it\nHer pussy travels, she doesn't have a pivot\nI remember when she was timid\nYour scandalous ass taking the pastor's cash\nGot him on tape suckin' your tits, snortin' and passin' hash\nI still had to grab that ass\nHad to laugh at stories about your ragged ass lickin' maxi pads\nYou silly bitch, she used to be a nerdy bitch\nNow she's in the backyard fuckin' 30 kids\n\n[Verse 4: Kon Artis]\nNow besides being on X, and regardless me loving sex\nWe getting close to your lex, it's grindin' every kick\nTwo fingers up your pussy, your hands rubbing my dick\nAs soon as my wife push me, your man's fucking her trick\n(You don't care if she know I trip)\nBut she's starting to get hip to it\n'Cause she's finding matches inside of my pocket that say I strip\nWhich means I might get caught, lose everything that I've brought\nThe house, kids, and the car, I know this sounds bizarre\nBut we should give her a call, and see if she want it in\nThat way it's three-way sex and we can all be friends\nI know you done if before, don't act like you haven't whore\nI'm 'bout to lose my wife I can't afford a divorce\n\n[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]\n(Sin with me; I warn you)\nShe Devil's in the house lemme here ya (Heeyyy)\nOff top I gots to get near ya\n\n[Verse 5: Swift]\nFucking with your pussy is a handful (for real)\nYou think I'm drowning, then you're clowning\nSo basically bitch you a damn fool\nAnd that's a given fact\nPlus I remember back when you was young\nI could see a 100 niggas through your gap\nAnd all of them was probably hitting that, that's embarrassing\nYou stuck with 30 children, 70 miscarriages\nIn and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is\nFucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it, but you did\n\n[Verse 6: Proof]\nDevil is she, she never to be (faithful)\nCredit to free, it's better that she (tranquil)\nEven her apple, my cock unlock the keys to your asshole\nStop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow\nCock the Glock at them, kings in the castle\nFresh out of school with a disease in the tassel, skeezin' is natural\nYou just my (ho') that's the reason you stack dough\n\n[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]\n(Sin with me; I warn you)\nShe Devil's in the house lemme here ya (Heeyyy)\nOff top I gots to get near ya\n\n[Outro]\n[Tech N9ne:] Shit, this feels good baby, whatchu say this was again?\n[Girl:] Don't worry about it, just relax\n[Tech N9ne:] Ooooo..

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nGoing to a funeral almost every other week, you know I'm sayin'?\nThat's the reason why I stopped going to the funerals\n'Cause all the young homies were always turned up dead\nI left the block at 17, so I didn't see them for a while when I left\nThat saved me\nBecause if I was gonna do that, I was gonna do that to the fullest\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nWe ain't the only gang members\nWe ain't the only ones with the insane tempers (Nah)\nSo many levels where Bane enters\nAnd hit the people with evil\nLeave 'em with pain whimpers, yeah\nWe ain't the only gang members\nThe only stealers and killers and family name enders\nSo watch your back when the action is brackin' or crackin'\n'Cause your cool little faction got flame embers, uh\nThey kicking and they pushing\nSpitting and they mushing (Who?)\nA Christian and a Muslim\nPay attention to them bangers, not a rarity\nAnd our dark age is filled with ignorance and barbarity\nNo clarity, fight against the faith and the infidels\nHoly wars having so many people sent to Hell\nReligious leaders went to jail, just like us deep in the cell\nSpent the bail, get out and show hatred on God is meant to fail\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nIf you choose a side, motherfucker\nBetter know what opposition, you can die, motherfucker\nAlthough organizations wanna deny other ruckus\nFrom the suckers, they don't care or wonder why brother buck it\nChristians calling Muhammad a terrorist, ain't it? (Nope)\nThe game split a long time ago and they can't quit\nBoonk Gang had it figured it out (What's that?)\nWhen he stated that it's a whole lot of motherfuckin' gang shit\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nEverything is active, blame it on the rap shit\nBlame it on every fucking thing but the stacks and the taxes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\nActive, everything is active\nEverything's a gang, it's a gang and it's ashes to ashes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nWe ain't the only gang members\nIt's still a fight against the black, white, hang genders\nDeep in the south, summer all the way 'til it became winter\nNow the boys in blue, they kill the black cocaine vendors, yeah\nWe ain't the only gang members\nWhite presidents and black leaders were slain, 'member?\nSo watch your back when some wack man attacking the black skin\nAin't no calm or relaxing life when strain hinders, uh\nRepublicans and Democrats in a spat\nSince the 1800's, it's been attacks, then it cracked\nAnd still do, different views will kill you\nThat is fuckin' mildew, they uplift the steel too\nLot of gang shit in Charlottesville\nUnite the Right rally bought a car to kill\nAin't no togetherness\nWhite supremacist and black will fight 'til finished\nBut all their rights diminished without a life replenished (Dead)\nJust like my homeboys\nAll the different groups in life packin' chrome toys\nIf you feel me, holler back\nNow it's gang colors if you wearing a MAGA hat (Word)\n'Cause the message of talking good old days\nUsin' force and more power, you know, them good old ways\nBut I know that flag is serious and if a man tore it\nThat'll be his ass if he kneel and don't stand for it\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nEverything is active, blame it on the rap shit\nBlame it on every fucking thing but the stacks and the taxes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\nActive, everything is active\nEverything's a gang, it's a gang and it's ashes to ashes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\n\n[Outro]\nYou know, my brain like, \"I wanna build a spaceship\"\n'Cause man is gonna blow this fucking place up\nThis spaceship has to be massive, it has to be like a football field\nI wanna build a spaceship, maybe like 180 thousand seater\nMaybe we can build something\nMy brain is thinking like, \"Okay, how are we gon' fly away from this motherfucker when it blows up?\"\nCatharsis"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nThe sadness gets deeper, and now my body's growing weaker\nTo EMJ this is dedicated; through this, you'll never belated, bro\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI told him, I ain't know you rap nigga, you cold blooded\nThe way he busted his flow on stage wasn't slow was it\nMy nigga was flippin', he grabbed the mic and was rippin'\nUntil some idiots was trippin' and then I heard bullets whistling\nThen I sang 'em, I just want to celebrate, he laughed\nCause said he's \"writing a song called Reno 911 straight on they ass\"\nFar as words go, it's crazy them were the last I heard\nEMJ on this emotional musical journey\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nCome ride with me, it's so sad to see, still ride with me\nSo join me, let me share with this world as I live out the dreams\nWe won't be gone for long, I promise you won't be alone\nIf you lose me, I'm writing the words of this song\nMy man Michael Jones, on this emotional musical journey\n\n(Yo, this is OG Muggs, wanna shout out to my man EMJ\nGod took you away, it was too soon man\nYou're up there with the angles looking down\nAnd watching our world right now brother\nWe love you, we miss you, we'll never forget you EMJ\nRest in peace brother)\n\n[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]\nThat was my nigga\nIn the bunk right across from mine\nCracking them jokes like all the time\nHoppin' on stage with him every night\nAnd why niggas\nWould ever wanna take somebody's life\nWho was living it like a shining light\nMan all the homie ever did was smile\nI still don't understand it, don't think I ever will\nWhy I couldn't have been the bitch nigga\nThat god had let get killed\nInstead he took EMJ away, it's safe to say\nI'll see your face again someday, at pearly gates\nBut I hold you in my heart until\n\n[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]\nAt times I'm like\nYo EMJ, where you been?\nI know you lookin' down on me like\n\"Here I am, Kutty!\nAnd I ain't wanting for nothin' homie\nNo, mourning do nothin' for me\nYour love is enough in store in its glory\nOr what, so pour me a drink\nWe can cheer and toast, giving thanks to why\nYou didn't lose a partner, you gained a gangsta for life\nIn your heart I exist, but through music I'm able to live\nI see the way you floss me all on your wrist\nAnd that's what's up, man\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n(On my highest day my nigga, you was there\nNow I'm on my lowest day, cause you're not here\nI miss you my nigga, love you EMJ)\n\n[Verse 4: Bernz]\nI seen a cruel bitch, met her in Reno Nevada\nShe'll have you living your dreams and take 'em all with no problem\nIn dark alley ways, where devils wait for the shootout\nAt someone who was special, I told my family about him\nI saw his first tour, he told me Tech was his hero\nAnd watched him from the crowd, to then go rock the same theaters\nStep out of bounds and rounds can fly, behind casinos\nOn the night I never gambled and still lost it all in Reno\n\n[Verse 5: Wrekonize]\nIf I only had 8 bars, to come and deliver to you in the graveyard\nI'd say god is shitty for even releasing you behind the 8-ball\nThe pain's hard, I know you got kiddies to carry your name on\nBut I'm praying for 'em, so they don't end up just singing the same song\nI'm hearing it in my sleep, I'm hearing it in the head\nThere's whispers on the beat, screaming EMJ where you been\nI promise you everyone out here shed tears, until he remembers\nHigh powered mayhem, EMJ, Mayday's 7th member\n\n[Verse 6: Stevie Stone]\nRemember like it was yesterday, show up in Reno\nOff of the bus and to off a Bourbon then we hit the Casino\nAnd then we, we did the show an we was only\nIt was all that crying and you and Rock was on that homie\nNever should have left you lonely, you took six and survived it\nTalked to you a couple days ago, still riding\nNo one never thought there was complications rising\nA blood clot inside him, EMJ died I'm like\n\n(EMJ, it's Cross-Eyed Joe man, we all fucking miss you bro)\n(EMJ, what can I say man, rest in paradise\nRest in paradise pimpin, we love you)\n\n[Verse 7: Jay Rock]\nMichael Jones, I miss you my nigga\nEMJ, still tryna cope with this\nStill can't believe that you gone and I know I gots to be strong\nRevenge is mine said the lord, so we gotta let him take control\nBut lord knows that I wanna grab the gat\nCock back and land a blow and watch heads roll\nYou was a talented man, I watched you gravitate fans\nShouted out where you been, people was all in a trance\nThen we step on stage, you'd say \"You killin 'em, Rock\"\nThen I'd say \"You killin 'em, MJ,\" then you say \"Let's put on for Watts\"\nYou strong as an ox, in the bed just laying with shots\nLaughing and jokin', meanwhile I'm going through emotions\nThen you tell me Jay Rock, you gotta keep goin' on daddio\nYour album about to drop, plus you can't be slacking bro\nYeah fo' sho' my nigga, I know this a minor set back\nBut you told me keep killin' 'em, you gon' be alright\nI'mma be back, no time bet that, then I got that phone call\nIt was bad news at its best and it hurt me\nThat I lost my friend on this emotional musical journey\n\n[Verse 8: Magnum PI]\nHold up roll up a Swisher, light up and paint a picture\nOnly if painted different, I would have been right there with you\nSo instead of cryin', I rejoice and pour out some liquor\nHenny straight or mix it with lemonade, feel like I should be ashamed\nI had to look you mama dead in the face\nShe told me everything was gon' be okay\nYou told me if anything you should be on your way home any day\nSoon as we all relaxin' the phone rang, heard her sayin'\nI'm goin' crazy, it's crazy, I'm thinkin' maybe just maybe\nI'm misunderstandin' what your lady was sayin'\nNaw-naw, you can't be serious, stop your talkin' delirious\nGot my mom on the phone, you already know where his spirit went\nSo I drink that Hen 'til there no more left, right that wrong no it don't go left\nWrite this song try not stress, gotta be strong yet fight to death\nAs far as visions go that's that was last way that I saw\nEMJ on this emotional musical journey\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYo Tech what you feeling on the state of hip hop?\nAnd is hop hop still alive or dead?\nI mean I love the state of hip hop right now you know what I'm sayin'\nI love it and I think hip hop is very alive you know what I'm sizzlin'\nWhenever you got brothers and sisters you know I'm sayin\nComin' up out of poverty, you know what I'm sizzlin'\nDoing something positive like music, you know what I'm sizzlin'\nAnd making money I mean you know what I'm sayin'\nI mean where is the motherfuckin' death in that?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO\nMy mama was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow\nWhen it came to rap and R&B and plenty more\nCheck it, if it wasn't no gospel, apostle\nOr written in the Bible, then it go\nSo when they tell the baby don't do something\nThen it end up doing it anyway\nLike, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today\nBut, I really fell in love with the sound\nThat was coming out from the East Coast\nSo we got it and twisted it up a bit\nNow the industry's having a heatstroke\nSome say that rap is dead\nBut when I get the white, black and red\nAnd jump on the tour bus, do 58 shows\nThen I'm back with a big black sack of bread\nCan't believe that that was said, 'cause I'm here with a stack of fed\nAnd I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg\nSo, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire\nAnd I like my fans spending grands 'cause we got the fire\nI merchandise like 5 G's every half an hour\nAnd you cry like a baby so your mic must be your pacifier\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby\nWhen I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?\nWhen I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby\nWhen I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?\n\nIf it's negative, I don't wanna hear it\nEliminating player haters with they evil spirits\n\n[Verse 2]\nI hear 'em talkin', they mad at Smurf and Soulja Boy\nThey hating big in the magazine and don't even know the boys\nI know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people\nRun up to the car, pull out the Mac Lethal\nMan that's a problem with the black people now\nWhat ya need to know is that, in the world there's a lot of dough to stack\nAnd the ones that wanna hold us back ain't been outside their cul-de-sac\nEvery nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back\nBut notice that, I can put it right down to where the shoulders at\nHating on the south? Why? Trippin' off them chips they got\nYou don't like that it's screwed and chopped\nBut you wanna get off in they pot\nWanna be MC, you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot\n'Cause their 84's be poking out, what the hell is you cryin' 'bout?\nEverybody wanna be killer but not for realer\n'Bout the method of making money you gotta get the milla\nBy doin' it like I do it, do the work and believe in it\nWhen you do it to the fullest ain't no problem achieving it\nWhen I was broke, homie I went for mills\nGot on the mic with the intent to kill\nStronger than ever, and you a gimp for real\nI drink Caribou Lou, and you drink Enfamil CHUMP\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby\nWhen I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?\nWhen I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby\nWhen I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou should be clapping when folk make it up out the ghetto\nOr trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guerro\nBut you don't know how to be manly\nInstead of a Timberland, you probably in a stiletto\nBetter yet in a baby shoe, jealous or maybe you\nSick of me 'cause I'm making dinero\nAnd you don't wanna get clapped at\nYou want a standing ovation? I thought not!\nYou say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop\nTry to run up on me, 'cause a Benzo will never be in your car slot\nTry to step up on the scene, my infrared beam's right at your soft spot\nIf you was on TV and balling you wouldn't groan and trip\nHe'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip\nTech got long cream with chrome things on his whip\nHe wanna stone Nin' with a chrome thing on his hip\nBut just know your hip will not stop the hop\n'Cause when you look at the big picture, my block pops a lot daily\nSo keep on thinking my Guac stops the shots\nAnd I can quickly bury you in your Osh Kosh B'Gosh, baby\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby\nWhen I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?\nWhen I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, crybaby\nWhen I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH-WAH-WAH, what you crying 'bout?\n\n[Outro]\nI am one of them Mcs that\nHater I can congratulate\nHaters need to go get theirs, 'cause I'm getting mine youknowI'msaying"

Yates gonna blast at the\nNaysayers yappin', the K comin' after ya\nI'm in a battle with enemies and I'ma kick up the energy\nWith the divinity, nobody malicious can limit me\nI locked rap, back in the day the city where chops at\nShocked at some of 'em saying I ain't the top cat, stop that\nWith your wack sound\nThey know if they trippin', I'ma come with enough B's\nTo hit 'em with the stingers, they do nothin' but just bleed\nBut for now I'ma stunt on them and tell 'em to suck seed\n\n[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]\nOh, tell me how to fail\nWhen you look at all I've got\nAnd what's in front of me\nAnd then if you can't tell when you're looking at me\nI buss for fun while they suck seed\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nI love it, glasses and asses up\nI love it, yeah, we get the bag for what?\nLook at me, look at me, what the fuck?\nLook at me, look at me, nigga, I'm rich forever (Okay)\nYou niggas suck seed\n\n[Verse 2: King Iso]\nLike Monica with a stain on her blouse\nMy cock got the moniker, bitches keep my name in their mouth\nI'm a thermometer, you can't monitor with JVC\nWhile I just lay on the couch and she suck it like it's Tang in the pouch\nI'ma get to bussin' like a AA-12 do\nHaving fun with the bullet, get it? I'm playing around\nYou ain't safe 'cause I'll knock out bodies in the safe, not a sound\nIt goes up, even when I piss, I don't aim at the ground\nNiggas be thinking they better but never could buss at the kings\nSteady be rappin' and cappin' just like the gunpowder thing\nNiggas don't want smoke, I do like when you run out of trees\nTakin' flight on you niggas just like I jumped out a swing\nAll them suckers by you, they can't help you\nI stage dive with guns, I jump out and squeeze\nHaters treat success like it's a one hour deed to succeed\nNever, but here's a bag of sunflower seeds, little nigga\n\n[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]\nOh, I don't know how to fail\nI've never not been hot\nLook what you've done to me\nAnd then if you can't tell when you're close to me\nI'm what you'd be if you didn't suck seed"

We can't bury this man without prayer!\nThere is nothing to pray for, sir\nHe has entered a much better world than this...\nAt least so you ministers always say, sir"

Will they attack with a blast?\nWhen the night calls, it's gonna be a nice brawl\nFor the darkness to come and make my brightfall\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nGet it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix, rid it out\nDon't ever wanna see, what that pit about\nWe just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out\nGet it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix, rid it out\nDon't ever wanna see, what that pit about\nWe just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm fighting for a bright life\nBut evil wanna consume me and my soul is the right price\nThat would literally be a fright night\nBut I ain't sellin' my soul to hell, angels yellin' propellin' flight heights\nWanna spread these angel wings\nBut they have wicked entangled things\nLike steamin' hot tar with the stench of brimstone\nKnee in God's yard, can I repent the sin gone?\nDid that, done that, then the evil comes back\nRunnin' from myself, it seems it ain't no runnin' from that\nJust when you wanna start anew\nThey judge you on what you used to be, thus makin' it harder to\nBut I refuse to lose, even if I gotta be banged and bruised\nWhy do we have to battle just to go the bright route?\nOh well, I'm 'bout to beat this Hell until it's lights out\n\n[Outro]\nAlive and I'm well, did I win in hell? The fight just to save my soul\n'Cause time and time again, when I crawl to the light, I land in sin\nNow my sins so far away, that darkness will never find me\nHideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque\nHideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque\nHideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque\nHideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque\nHideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque\nHideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque\nHideous, grotesque, hideous, grotesque"

I think I wanna say it again, y'all\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\n\n[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\nCan't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nYo!

No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\nCan't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\n\n[Bridge 2: Tech N9ne]\nThis beat make me wanna say hallelujah (HAHAHA)\nYo, but instead I'm gonna say (what!?)\nY'all can't fuck with us\nY'all can't fuck with us\n\n[Verse 3: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nOkay this the benediction (now we got y'all listenin'!)\nWhoa, just a fraction of friction from an act you was missin'\nIf you would actually listen you'd see whose ass you'd be kissin' (MUAH)\nYou're dealin' with one hell of a relic, ya see\nI'm angelic but devils bring out the devil in me\nI might pull it, the bullets'll be several, you'll see\nA goody-goody get hoody, lesson from messin' with me\n\n[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]\nThis is my testament Tecca Nina's been pressed against walls\nSimply the best to get next to this so I represent all\nGrab your breasts to this, have mo' sex to this, pop your crystal\nCock ya legs a bit, rock ya bed to this, drop the big drawls\n'Tis to men to never wanna take a stand to\nYou chumps in trouble? We 'bout to bubble like shampoo\nYou might try but you can't do what Aaron and Sam do\nYou tryin' to ban who?\nNo can do!\n\n[Tech N9ne]\nIt's a celebration bitches, yo\nY'all can't fuck with us\n\n[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo!

And schools were integrated\nHow could we do no wrong? Racism demonstrated\nGot to be moving on before I'm eliminated\nPossibly use the chrome because I've been degraded\nScratch that, I'm not that cat\nI would never wanna keep a rat-tat in my backpack\nNever had nobody to snap at, I'm a class act\nBut one day somebody had doom\nWe heard two blacks got stab wounds\nAnd got beat and kicked, white elites and shit\nWhen the lights went out in the bathroom\nEverybody was heated, people been mistreated\nIt's a damn shame that a Klan came and gave a man pain, a misdeed hit 'cause of skin tone\nThem gone to the hospital from a sin zone\nSkin domes doing them wrong you can send home, but they been gone\nNow everybody on edge\nClassroom break to the bathroom, seen hood niggas and they all want heads\nBad moon, hate taking that tune\nThey said to me, \"When the whites come in\nWe gon' hit the lights and gon' get they ass\"\nI said to all of 'em, \"Is this a gag?\"\nNah, they wanna break 'em all like Mr. Glass\nIt happened, the whites en route\nCracking, the lights went out\nI laid to the floor\nThen I found my way to the door, away from the gore\nThe hoods came out\nBloody and sweaty, I said, \"That shit ain't regal\nIn fact, that shit is evil\nSo why in the hell are you doing that to innocent people?\"\n\n[Chorus: Love, Mae C.]\nIt feels so sad, I'm not perfect\nAlways kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing\nIt feels so sad, I'm not perfect\nAlways kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing\n\n[Outro: Love, Mae C. & Tech N9ne]\nIt feels so sad, I'm not perfect\nAlways kill, feel so sad and I can't see it slowing"

You on keyboard, I gotta get this fixed, man, damn... Alright, there we go. Alright man, sit over there though\n\n[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nSeven o'clock, I was upstairs\nI was on the keyboard making that tear\nKnock on the front door, C.O. got it\nNiggas came in, I said \"Yo, get in the closet\"\nHit 'em with venom and run up in 'em while they rummagin'\nToo many niggas was coming in, I wanna get me one\nHopin' niggas try me cause I'm finna feel like \"fry me\"\nEyes all Chinese, high off reefer\nI'ma get deeper, turn to the Grim Reaper\nUse a heat seeker when I creep with the heater\nLeave a deep gash, bring the heat fast\nHit 'em with the venom, when I get 'em I'ma keep 'em\nGiving them an enema, even if it's ten of 'em\nThen I'ma, eat 'em like dinner in the cinema\nThen I'ma, shit 'em out, get 'em out\nIn about twenty-four seconds I'ma fuck 'em in the ass\nTuck 'em in the grass, cut 'em up fast\nButtercup, shut 'em up, I'ma cut mass\nI'ma cut lass, nigga he got it, he gotta fuck 'em up, yeah\nTell me if I'm tripping\n\n[Hook: Tyler Lyon]\nAm I my paranoid or scared\nOr is this my nightmare\nWere they ever really there?\nTell me if I'm tripping\nAm I supposed to sit and wait\nWhile they storm through the gate\nPsycho just like Norman Bates\nTell me if I'm tripping\n\n[Interlude 2: Prozak, Woman]\nI don't really wanna play this, guys... This isn't something to mess around with\nCome on, it's just a game, nothing to worry about, sit down\n(Hey, man, hand me one of those beers)\nBut it's not just a game...\nIt is, everything is gonna be fine, hand me a beer too. Come on, let's do it\n\n[Verse 3: Prozak]\nI can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994\nAnd a group of us was chilling at the table, we was drinking  with our fingers on the Ouija board\nTryna summon spirits asking \"Ouija, can you hear us?\" never thinking what was in store\nThen the dogs started barking, in the darkness, all of a sudden it was knocking at the front door\nThen we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open\nNervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion, no one was there, we went back to the board hoping\nThat we finally made contact, with the deity, apparition on the other side\nThen it started moving out and soon it was spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die\nWe decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment\nOn the way home Sarah hit a patch of ice, lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life\n\n[Bridge: Tyler Lyon]\nAm I my paranoid or scared\nWere they ever really there?\nTell me if I'm tripping\nAm I supposed to sit and wait\nWhile they storm through the gate\nPsycho just like Norman Bates\nTell me if I'm tripping\n\n[Outro]\n(coughing) Fuck that shit, nigga, hmm, let's party"

(I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)\nThen why you stopping and popping me out the deck for?\nHear that I got the best flow? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)\nGranny clipping, tripping with Ellie and Jethro\nFor listenin' to my music they choose it, they use it\nAs therapy they're on me when I do this, they lose it\nMom and daddy wanna ban me, I'm loud like a wild banshee\nI'm rowdy and antsy, maybe that's why they can't stand me for real\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & (Krizz Kaliko)]\nThese are people who can't stand me\nYour mama, your daddy, your greasy-ass granny\nWho be callin' me uncanny\nYour mama, your daddy, your greasy-ass granny\nThey tell you: (\"I'm no good to you,\" but you don't listen to me\nI'm the one you love, but your people can't stand me)\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nShe knew this rap kid was a stack getta\nBut dad lit up, when he saw that the kid was a black nigga\nAnd she's a wack bitch, if you fight back with her\nAnd her mama's mad sick, cause the lad's dick is from Africa\nThat's why they always act shady, we splat babies right at Brady's\nThat's maybe the worst for a white lady, that's racy\nNo longer match-makey, when the blacks\nAttack wack, they be watchin' the mac lately\nEver been with a black dude? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)\nYou're prolly thinkin' we all weed and tattoos\nEver thought white and black's cool? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)\nThat's cause you think your daughters' gettin' her back bruised\nYour mom's in your business, she's in your business\nCan't you see she wants you to keep us niggas at a distance?\nSeparation existin', and here's cold\nThis story took place when I was 16 years old, yo\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]\nVes, que ellos dicen\nQue soy malo para ti\nSi tu me amas\nTe puedo deshonrar, deshonrar\nNo soy bueno\nPero te amo, te amo\nNo soy bueno\nPero te amo, te amo"

(N9ne!)\nThe show gritter and yo little low wigger\nBetter not be caught with no sitter\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga\nThey don't understand me, God naturally tanned me\nYou don't like it, I can be a nigga\nRockin' 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin'\nWhen they eyes hit this rock and roll nigga (Hell yeah!)\nAnd I ain't changin', got my Slipknot bangin\nAnd I swear to God I ain't never ever giving up\nFried chicken wings and Coors Light, nigga what?"

come\u2005from roaches, hardly no chips\nGranny on\u2005hocus pocus revelations and giant locusts\nOh shit, we was hopeless, folks just on the broke list\nRogues get loaded and served the bogus with a fo' fifth\nMy G, I ain't always been super icy\nStealing food in Hy-Vee slyly\nI see Nike's on Do The Right Thing with Spike Lee\nBut I could not buy when the size be pricy, why me?\nThen my earth sounded, first round\nI put the work down and many mercs counted\nThirst found and in a cursed town\nAnd with a turf crown, I eat a surf sandwich\nTurn the page and I'm rocking shows\n'Round the flock of hoes and my partner rose\nOut the top of Hip-Hop with a lot of dough\nAnd I got the soul like I'm Pappadeaux (Lock and load)\nForgot how many time they tell me I'm Forbes, we sell, we encore\nWay back in the day I was like, \"Help me, I'm poor\" (Cha)\nMillions all around the world, they took what I hid\nInside, I put it in music, made it, Ma look what I did\n\n[Chorus: Jehry Robinson]\nLook what I did, yeah, look what I did\nWe got money all around us, I'm a legend to these kids now\nLook what I done, yeah, how far we come\nKeep running up the numbers 'til we get to number one\nI look where I'm at now, we ain't in the background\nRunning through the crowd, real proud, got my hat down\nLook at where I'm at now, money come in racks now\nNever faked it, look, mama I made it, that's a fact now\n\n[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]\nFrom the trap to this rap shit, nigga, immortalized\nThey sayin' that I'm weird, nah, certified\nI grew up around G's, shelters and in the P's\nFeeling helpless, on my knees, help us, Lord, please\nRemember turnin' the light on, watchin' the roaches flee\nUsed to rock a turtleneck in school, they made fun of me\nUsed to share sneaks with Meech, just tryin' not to make some creases\nMy moms been deceased, just tryna live with some peace\nNo boxes, swear conflict is obnoxious, obnoxious\nAll that hate you do is toxic, self-made, couple bosses (Ooh)\nWe got booed, came back, sold out every room\nCoachella, one more mixtape, overseas we like The Beatles (Trippy)\nHighest nigga in every city, pay dues\nBonnaroo's was splittin' a dollar fifty, I snooze\nStill sleep, but our prices are still increasing\nYa geek, and ain't new to this\nUsed to dream of this and we eatin' now\n\n[Chorus: Jehry Robinson]\nLook what I did, yeah, look what I

the Architect]\nYou the weakest link, I'm one with them Kansas City Chiefs\nYou say I'm one of one, but my whole course a million niggas deep\nI only see what I want, I struggle for the freedom, too\nIf you can take portion, be a force, or will you lead 'em to survivin'?\nDon't trouble my soul with problems, I got problems of my own\nI thought I would weigh my options, but the truth, man, I was wrong\nI covered the game with something to say, raised in the slums and I bumped in the Bay\nRollin' me in and I'm pullin' the pin while you grip the grenade\n\n[Verse 4: Meechy Darko]\nI'm a big boy, she suck me up and rub my six pack\nNiggas sell millions, make millions, never give back\nBone crushers, them copper tops that leave your ribs cracked\nBorn in the trenches, boy, my first words was \"Click, clack\"\nRevenges, outsmarting forensics\nRelentless intentions until the top spot is relinquished\nBoy, your top spot my hit list, sweet tastin' revenge\nVictory, this shit's delicious, take your swig from the bottle\nWipin' Hennessy off my whiskers\nHit the block, chop it up, bag it 'til your fingers blister\nTag his toe, dig 'em ditches, clean knife but dirty pistol, woah\nShoot his lights out, pass the pistol like a give-and-go\nLast time out but I don't need a coat\nSplash brothers, wet 'em up\nHit every sibling and half brother\nYou're dead as fuck, dead as fuck\nYeah, my orange box cutter, keep the world on rotation\nHitchcock, Leatherface and Freddy, Jason\nBlood-soaked clothes, mildew in my basement\nLook what I did, what I done just to make it\n(Look what I did) Huh, just to make it\nLook what I did, what I done just to make it (Lil' bitch)\n\n[Chorus: Jehry Robinson]\nLook what I did, yeah, look what I did\nWe got money all around us, I'm a legend to these

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nThinking back to all the bad I did (bad I did)\nHow I was young and evil as a kid (as a kid)\nOk, I'm better now, I ask the reverend (ask the reverend)\nCause of my hell\nWill I go because the life I'm livin' feel like heaven (feel like heaven)\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nGrown better man still I'm in my gang attire\nDoes not mean I'm going to be cast into a ring of fire\nDoes it? If so them words you speak I can't admire\nThe evil's in my past but today the saint is ours\nGet and give a lot of love, guess my Allah just follows us\nI was stuck, taught us, now we caught up in goddish hugs\nEverywhere we go, there he go, went from very low\nTo unnecessary owes when he carries flows over the stereo\nI'm, on my 7 all because of rhyme\nBut because I played the 6 once upon a time\nThe reverend says my worldly ways I need to deaden\nBut I can't tell because this life I'm living feel like heaven\n\n[Bridge 1: Krizz Kaliko]\nIs it heaven, or is my head up in the clouds\nIs there hell for me, cause I feel like we made it out\nI put my halo on but then, it done came off again\nYou don't need eyes to see, that this could be our only heaven\n\n[Chorus: Nikkiya]\nSo, if you see my feet up off the ground\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\nOh, if you see my halo falling down\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\n\n[Verse 2: Oobergeek]\nIt's funny, and when I think I'm up there...\nThey say I fais le cul to much\nBut they just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu too much\nCaught up in the antics\nYeah I'm tied to you because I was thinking semantics\nSo is it dependent on what your heaven is?\nOr how big your 6 and 7 is?\nEverything preaches to you, you decipher who the reverend is\nThis verse is speaking to the ones seeking peace in any form\nFar from norm' imaginations, the brain rains when it storms\nYou say names then it forms, manifest things that were foreign\nTo you once upon a time no coincidence is gonna rhyme\nMake sense in a normal line\nOf words you learned them at the time and they remain timeless\nFeeding of the dreams that you promised\nBefore niggas knew you were prominent and dominant\nAnd all those powerful words that back then, to be honest\nWere just nouns and verbs; the looks on the astonished\nAre normal by now I seen them same faces when I was in Spiderman pajamas\n\n[Chorus: Nikkiya]\nSo, if you see my feet up off the ground\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\nOh, if you see my halo falling down\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\n\n[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nHeaven or hell?\nI never thought that this could be so real\nI never thought that I would ever build\nMy own heaven\n\n[Chorus: Nikkiya]\nSo, if you see my feet up off the ground\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\nOh, if you see my halo falling down\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nI remember back in the day I had this song called \"My Own Hell.\"\nIt was depressing\nBut since then, I've created my own heaven, baby!\nAnd it's beautiful!\n\n[Outro 2: Tech N9ne]\nIncredibly no one deaded me when it was lead at these red Dickies\nNobody beheaded me, let it be, said I'm breaded B\nReal light, within darkness I still fight it\nBut if heaven is love, then this sure in the hell feel like it!"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWelcome to The Sextion, where it's all about sex\nIf horny is what you're looking for, well this is the place\nThe Sextion\nNow, for your listening pleasure\nThis is Tech N9ne, Skatterman and Krizz Kaliko with seven words\nHow many words?\n\"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven\"\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nIt's seven words I wanna say to you\n\"Love it when you suck my dick\"\nIt's the best thing in my world\nIt's seven words I wanna say to you\n\"Love it when you suck my dick\"\nGirl, it's why I'm giving you seven words\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nYou should look at this as a wonderful endeavour\nThe pleasure of having a bitch go below the belt for treasure\nNo pressure, I know you shy and I ain't tryna stress ya\nCan I undress ya? And get ya to swallow each and every measure?\nDamn! You put the \"whore\" in hormones, I might just bust before long\nLet's take a pic in your phone of you taking more and more dome\nDo it but don't pinch me, don't chew it when you think me\nGet fluid then you sink me, 'cause you got to/two it just like pinky\nI really love it when you put the hot water in your mouth\nSlurping and slobbering about, now it gets hotter in the south\nYep, the water was blazing, it was amazing\nAnd now my dick is shriveled up like a raisin'\nYou love my leg in third, 'cause I'm blessed with heaven's curve\nAnd I equal the thrill and rush of having sex on X and herb\nNever get the lesson blurred, I'd like to rest in her\nBut not before I issue baby doll my seven words\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nIt's seven words I wanna say to you\n\"Love it when you suck my dick\"\nIt's the best thing in my world\nIt's seven words I wanna say to you\n\"Love it when you suck my dick\"\nGirl, it's why I'm giving you seven words\n\n[Verse 2: Skatterman]\nFor the sake of argument, let's say we call her \"Ol' Girl\"\nShe had the type of lips to make this street nigga's toes curl\nIt's her world, all I do is kick back, just sit back\nShe let my zipper down and pulled the head out and licked that\nShe licked that, sometimes I had to fight to get my dick back\nBut baby moved to Minnesota, swear to God I miss that\nThe way she used to grab and smack herself all in the face with it\nLooking at me dead in my eyes while she be tasting it (tasting it)\nShe used to say \"Daddy, you wasting it\" (wasting it)\nI used to say \"Baby, I'm pacing it\"\nBut fuck the hot water shit, she used that crushed ice (crushed ice)\nIf she sucked your dick once she make you nut twice (nut twice)\nShe was just that good\nI could sell her for a stack to my boys in the hood\nSo if you got you one of these, keep them faking bitches to the curb\nLeave this on her voicemail, all you need is seven words\n\n[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]\nNow as she sucks my soul, I lick her funky emotions\nPiercing all the way into her mind so I can feel what she's thinking\nFeel me? I know you do\nWe're getting closer and closer, eruption is imminent\nClimax is closing in on us\nIf you don't get your hands on me soon, I might disappear\nHere is what I been waiting on, the best thing you ever heard\nThe one, two, three, four, five, six, seven words\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nIt's seven words I wanna say to you\n\"Love it when you suck my dick\"\nIt's the best thing in my world\nIt's seven words I wanna say to you\n\"Love it when you suck my dick\"\nGirl, it's why I'm giving you seven words\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne + (Female)]\nMmm, mmm, you know what I want you to do, right?\n(Yeah, I know what you want me to do)\nWhat's that?\n(Do you want it with hot water?)\nWhat's that?\n(You mean to tell me freaky ass Tech N9ne ain't never had it with no hot water?)\nNah, show me\n(Hold up a second)\nWhat the fuck?\n(And then you do it like that)\nOK, go ahead... ahh shit, fuck, that's wonderful!\n(That's what I thought)"

Every now and then I pop more than Yosemite\nKeep my foes and my enemies and the ones that pretend to be (Close to me)\n'Cause honestly them the ones that'll hinder me\nSo henceforth remember me, this voice is finna be\nHis choice of energy, by him I mean all men\nParty like it's 1999, smoke my wood tip wine\nGiving all my things to God then say \"Amen\"\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI'm living like I'm dying tomorrow\nSo I gotta do a lot of living today\nI think I'm gon' drown in a bottle\nAnd party like I think about to go in a day\nI'm seeing lots of pretty women so you know I'm going in\nThey gon' blow this whole world up so I'mma party until then\n\n[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]\n'Til summer's end, if the winter comes\n'Til gray days turn to yellow ones\nI stay grinding for mine, I tried to tell 'em once\nTo travel to the moon you gotta face the elements\nAnd battle any goon you gotta cage the elephants\nIt's elementary, I speak with a certain eloquence\nI smoke hella blunts, a habit I been developed since\nI was a young boy playing the silver ball\nSee 'em stand, feel 'em fall, Metallica, kill 'em all\nHuh, living like this is my last moment\nBut a moment could last forever\nSnap a picture and Nat Cole it\nGet whatever you gon' sip in your glass, hold it up\nHit the side on mine, get to tipping it back, throw in\nSo many days we was sitting low, better get busy living 'till the day\nYou giving in and get to go where the sinners go\nPulling the cash and spend it slow\nGotta make it fast, but them should know\nMatter no money yo, it's all expendable\nU-B-I\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI'm living like I'm dying tomorrow\nSo I gotta do a lot of living today\nI think I'm gon' drown in a bottle\nAnd party like I think about to go in a day\nI'm seeing lots of pretty women so you know I'm going in\nThey gon' blow this whole world up so I'mma party until then\n\n[Verse 4: Godemis]\nHold your breath, count to three I'mma kill it\nKiller commitee city chairman\nStrapped with a gramma Glock and the trigger, bitch, a hair pin\nThree round burst, I'm aiming at your brain\nSpin it, when I cock it I kiss it and call it Sara Jay\nLiving like I'm going down tomorrow, sit down and drown in a bottle\nGo out and get another bottle\nI don't lead I don't follow, If I don't eat I get hollow\nI don't even play lotto, see chief I need every dollar\nY'all don't see me with a model or rockin' a lot of Prada\nI don't smoke like I wanna, I'm stretching this marijuana\nFuck it, I call it karma if I wake up in Nirvana\nBlood is thicker than water, the mud is even more shallow\nShit, I live in the moment and pardon every opponent who pass\nBut I put the pedal to the metal, I got both feet on the gas\nThis could be the last verse that I'm writing, like it or not\nEverybody's taking a rob and they put you right in a box\n\n[Interlude: Tech N9ne]\nWohoo! That's Ces Cru! Ubiquitous and Godemis!\nY'all ain't fucking with that, boy!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI'm living like I'm dying tomorrow\nSo I gotta do a lot of living today\nI think I'm gon' drown in a bottle\nAnd party like I think about to go in a day\nI'm seeing lots of pretty women so you know I'm going in\nThey gon' blow this whole world up so I'mma party until then"

I guess not\nFuck it\n\n[Verse]\nYou was supposed to be my dawg\nHomie, when I first met you, what was told to me was fraud\nWhat a shocker, an imposter! I've been crossed, I lost ya\nMy best friend turned out to be an enemy that's endin' me\nHidden, no sympathy, no empathy either; homie, I never denied ya!\nNuttin' that you wanted: women? I never player-hated\nI hooked you up, booked you up from the beginning\nThis enemy had love for you, shared blood for ya\nWhen ya wanted to dig? I dug for ya, nigga\nBut you a double-crosser, nasty hand-tosser\nI shoulda known you was evil\nWhen you told me you was cool 'fore we'd be sex fools when we under the steeple\nThe retrieval: I'm tryna get my life back\nNo more stoppin' women from puttin' a knife at ya cap\nRemember when we was kickin' it? Bitches was givin' it everyday\nWe did it in every way, but the respect went away\nYou got a mind of your own now; you're grown now\nCan I ask you a question? Did you forget we kinfolks, nigga?\nWe the same complexion! I'm stressin'!\nYou was always in front of me so I listened\nEveryday you wanted me on a mission\nI even let you have sex with my lady like a G\nInfatuated with you and not me\nI sucked it up, I got back wit' her, you fucked it up\nBy lettin' her know I was creepin' around with every chick in the town, buster!\nI shoulda known not to trust ya!\nListen, I'm losin' my life because of you!\nI lost my life because of you! I'm losin' my wife because of you!\nI even had sex and a baby with the crazy bitch you introduced me to!\nNow I'm straight depressed, I hate your flesh\nBut fate was just belate to Tech, laid to rest\nEvery time you got drawers, you made my poor little life fall nigga, ya got balls\nYou ain't never had a partner like me\nReal, I never ever sold ya pipe dreams\nPersonal? Yes, it might seem\nNigga when you was burnin', I went and got the Doxycycline\nLooked out for ya health, and this is all the respect I get?\nHater, ya neck I'll slit, but I can't, 'cause I'm attached to ya\nAnd I don't know why, sometimes I wish you would just die\nIt would eliminate all this hurt\nMaybe I could get up outta all this dirt ya caused me\nSo strong, nothing could stop you, not even cerebral palsy\nI can't believe it; my best homie turned on me\nYou musta forgot we grew up together\nI'm through, life is over now, there's nothin' else to do\nPoint the finger and blame it on you\n\n[Tech + (sung)]\n(It's all because of you, you, you)\nI lost my girl, my world, is upside down because I found you wasn't shit\n(It's all because of you, you, you)\nBroke us in two, you untrue, don't know what to do, I'm talkin' to you (who?)\nMy dick\n\n{*chanting and thunder till fade*}"

I'd say heroism\nWe are the dauntless in the midst of demons, we see in swarms\nSo mind your business unless you see somebody being harmed\nI learned to love from my mother\nI feel an angel around me, I know she hovers\nImpatiently waitin' for you to discover\nThat people all need each other\nWhen you see me, I'll call you brother\nNever mattered, whatever color\n\n[Chorus: Jordan Omley]\nNo, we won't go quietly\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\nWe should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\nBut we won't go quietly\nAnd everybody say, \"No, we won't go quietly\"\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\nWe should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\nBut we won't go quietly\nAnd everybody say, \"No, we won't go quietly\"\nAnd everybody say, \"No, we won't go quietly\"\nNo, we won't go quietly\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\nIf we didn't fear each other, we could stand near each other\nStrange Music\nYa Bwi!"

I'm on a mission to dig his ditch\nAnd picture many christening with the pistol and pop it\nThe second I'm 'bout to cock it\nGet ready for the rocket then it's off with his head\nHe running off at the mouth then he dead\nStraight raw with it, I'mma get saw with it\nRip a little snitch when he drippin' now bitch crawl in it\nTattle-tale and you got the whole hood shook\nTell the people we evil that the whole hood cook, that is no good look\nThe penalty for the pussy that put us in penitentiaries, rolled, shook, whooped\nHis motherfuckin' ass for givin' po's good crooks\nWe put 'em in a section where there was no good book\nUnderstandable why your body is flammable\nHandle your fam with ammo nigga, animaly cannibal\nMan oh man, I'ma damage every strand of botanicals\nWith Barry Manilow playin', man my hand is mechanical\nStuck repeatedly, heated me and serviced and cheated me\nSo he bleeded immediately, depleted me deity\nCreepy I'm feeling deeply when I'm speaking of sleeping\nThe recently deceased peeps, he defeated so easily\nHush when you're rollin' through KC-MO\nBetter bust or they gonna lose their people\nNigga Killa City we hella for real and gritty\nItty bitty, you shitty, we let the stray heat go\nAnybody trying get over can never see us\nPut your money over your mouth or get beat up\nBloody murder we got it comin' through your speakers\nTecca N9na with Crooked I busting niggas and we just *Explosion*"

(To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Verse 1]\nAyy, treat it\nLike I was coming from Billings on the way to Spokane\nAnd you found me twisted and mangled inside our road van\nLike it's so ugly, the paramedics say \"Oh, man!\"\nThere go Tecca N9na with no life but more fans\nLike in hell or I'm in heaven, just fell in from 9-11\nPropelling from high and dove in the concrete\nLike my name was McVeigh and I check the mail and a bomb beeped\nLike having Griselda\u2019s dope and sell it beyond cheap\nLike I was in the mood for set tripping\nFights begin and Rugers get splitting\nLike my life is through and death slips in\nLike there's no air left and my chest stiffens\nLike I'm in the church and I'm preaching\nLoving the way sister look and after service we creeping\nPlay my music like we was in the telly deep asleep\nThen got murdered 'cause her husband was the deacon\n\n[Hook]\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)\nLike having super pneumonia with out taking my z-pack\nLike me off in a C function flamed up with a B hat\nAnd I'm pattin' my pockets yellin' \"Where's my piece at?\"\nLike an ink session getting a snake and the bat tat\nGot a gun and kicked in the face and I ran to the back \"Skat!\"\nThrough the alley under a ladder tripped over a black cat\nFell in the street got hit by a Toyota with a hatchback\nPlay my music like everyone know that I can rhyme\nBut I got shipped to Iraq and I stepped on a land mine\nLike a wild bull like out the cage and it's ram time\nMy job is to be the circus clown but I'm damn blind\nLike I had the cube and I accidentally called Pinhead\nLike I'm Matisyahu in a room full of skinheads\nPlay my music like I'm permanently in bed\nI'm sure the DJs are with it with him dead\n\n[Hook]\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\nPlay my music like I died!

(On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Verse 3]\n(Eugor god rof efil aggin)\nUnless I left my vest and I catch the magnum\nLike they let Tech rest and toe-tagged him\nAfter they beat him, tied him to the truck and skull dragged 'em\nLike I died of lupus, cancer, leukemia\nEpilepsy, m.s. or sickle-cell anemia\nAll at the same time and the call is a slain N9ne\nCaught by a serial killer with a saw and it's pain time\nGuess it really does pay to get caught with a stray\nThat's what it cost, what you pay in a way that's all for the say\n'Cause when you rapping your ass off\nSkill is their last thought\nRealler than real spill but you get killed and you blast off\nPlay my records like I'm takin' the big ride\nLike a deadly virus killing me inside\nI know you sucker DJs got a lotta pride\nAll jokes aside even though I'm still alive\n\n[Hook]\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Outro]\nPlay my music like I died\nLike the N9na ain't alive\nLike I took the long ride\nLike everybody loved my music\nAnd the whole world cried"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nWhen you see me smilin', I'm really frownin'\nYou think you're really wildin'? I'm killa clownin'\nMeaning I don't give a fuck about nothing you say that you do\nBecause stupid is how everybody sounded\nNigga you think you know me, but only if you knew me\nHomie, you would leave me by my lonely\nI'm thinking death and destruction\nImages of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble\nThinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging\n(That's just the devil, just the devil)\nBlock it out and keep it moving\nI'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing\nGimme the bible, yes I need it cause Tecca Nina's in ruin\nMentally I'm fuckin up when I really don't know what I'm doin'\nMy tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly\nI'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me\nThe holy father must have flipped and became mad at me\nBecause I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy\nHow to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)\nAny sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)\nYou don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall\nThe taste of blood on my tongue makin me want to brawl\nNo sentimental shit, death is the penalty\nFor any bitch you try to re-kindle this\nIt'll get your temple hit\nBout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get\nSend it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit\nSo teeter totter mothafucka if you want it\nBut just keep it to the left of me, crazy til the death of me\nPussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe\nHaving hella drama for Nina is a necessity\nGood and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee\nShit is looking like it is evil getting the best of me\nBitches think I'm pleasant and really wantin' the sex with me\nI'm promisin' you I'm losing it, you don't really want to mess with me\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYou don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)\nMake it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)\nIf you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)\nCause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)\nAnd I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it\nOne of us ain't gonna make it out\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael\nPush it you'll see what I'm talking bout\nYou don't want it with me\n\n[Verse 2: Mr. Reese]\nBetta load up your drums\nLoad up your guns\nEverybody better get to runnin'\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm a lyrical cynical rippin' ya pinnacle\nDamage anybody when I see they really want it with me\nTecha-ninna told me nigga get money\nAnd never been dumby\nShit on a nigga when he comin' funny with me\nFollow the beat follow your feet\nGimme the weed keys G's\nAnd a quarter pound of bullets with a machete\nMister Reese known for getting it poppin\nYou niggas be droppin'\nAnd when you do your albums be floppin\nWhen ever I spit it\nMan better yet when ever I drop it\nYour wifies gone cop it\nShe even tell you nigga go cop it\nYou don't want it with me\nI'll fuck your life up like a disease\nI'm hauntin your dreams\nWith a fully auto choppa them beams\nMayne yadadamean\nYa life ain't shit but a dream\nSo just remember when your breathin' you don't want it with me\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYou don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)\nMake it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)\nIf you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)\nCause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)\nAnd I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it\nOne of us ain't gonna make it out\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael\nPush it you'll see what I'm talking bout\nYou don't want it with me\n\n[Verse 3: Prozak]\nAnd you don't want it from me\nSee I'm believing that people are really angels and demons\nInstead of human beings\nI'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding\nCausin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving\nEntered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles\nKeep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles\nI'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows\nAs I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles\nMy eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums\nIt's time to hit the streets with guns\nI'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run\nI plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done\nUntil the pain coincides with my violence and agony\nOh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me\nBut it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds\nThe Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYou don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)\nMake it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)\nIf you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)\nCause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)\nAnd I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it\nOne of us ain't gonna make it out\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael\nPush it you'll see what I'm talking bout\nYou don't want it with me"

W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe?)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nGods!\n\n[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]\nMe and Tech and them started on a quest for\nM... O-N-E-Y, we touching so many, why?\n'Cause we spiritual, feeling every syllable we spit out\nWe angels, that's the way we telling demons to get out\nSo bled out, baddest nigga representing the Mi-ddle\nFeeling like the world cannot live with-out, Ta-dow!\nNow we immortal! Somebody open up the portal!\nRap is [?] when me and Nina was caught on!\nWe God status, God threw a task at us\nTold us he make us angels but our mission's to kill the baddest\nSo we gotta blast the bastards with our rapping apparatuses\nNever let off the ravage on 'em like rabbits on radishes\nWe're like the Grateful Dead, our fans are the new dead heads\nRepeat every word we saying like it's a pled-edge\nAnd when you hear them gods and love how it sounded\nWhen you see the king, kneel to the ground, make a fist and pound it\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe?)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nGods!\n\n[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]\nI told you I'm forever, didn't I?\nThe highly exalted the christen (your souls)\nThose grounded I aspire to lift 'em up\nThe holy goes through the frequency of your audio speakers\nThey're set on all that can reach us, by now we're adios\nWitness the blessings, beliefs and hopefulness I bestow\nUpon a fan or foe, man or those opposing the Chanet growth\nI plant it so everyone on the planet can evoke\nThe entity sent to be this music industries' manifold\nI manifested; it's been suggested that I arose up\nFrom under the sheets of God's baby cradle sent down to pose\nA threat to Masonic rappers, protest against moral lackage\nInvested in this infested depiction of worldwide gibberish\nS-suffer no more here it is, a little experiment with Jesus\nBlood and mortal when the spirit mix\nDrink it, it's so refreshing - just like the air of my message\nThe breeze carries and once you inhale it\nThen I will ask you\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe?)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nGods!\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nExalted, bosses, can't off his office with crosses\nThat's what he fought within darkness' mosses\nNo caustic losses 'cause the brain's embossed with the word auspiciousness\nFeed my fam flows fluidly, they would never leave my land no truancy\n'Cause I am the reason they stand for unity\nUnlike me with whackness you give your fans no immunity\nI am the air they share, I am the heir to the throne\nWhere no compare in my own zone, this lair is home grown\nIt's rare but it's on strong\nBeware: long gone if you dare got the wrong tone\nNow! We are beyond those who got fame\nGave my heart and many souls were obtained\nSo my lane will definitely not change\nCause G.O.D.S. means the Great Omnipotent Doc Strange\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe?)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it he, is it me? W-E, them G-O-Ds?\n(Do you believe, believe, believe)\nDo you believe? Do you believe?\nWho do you believe in?\nGods!\n\n[Outro]\nStrange Music"

   "lyrics": "[Prologue]\nThere's certain situations that occur throughout your life, that gives you an attitude, you know, a really bad attitude, because you've been taught by good people how to treat people with respect and you learned right and wrong. So, when shit is always wrong around you and you a mothafucka that's been taught to do right, you have a certain attitude towards those kind of mothafuckers or towards those things that are wrong and not righteous. You start getting a fuckin' attitude that might piss other people off. But you don't give a fuck, because the things that they do or the unjust shit that they do, makes you anti as fuck -- anti everything, anti everything they're about -- cause it ain't good, anti everything they fuckin' breathe or eat or whatever the fuck. You're just against everything that ain't right, why I feel like I feel. I feel like fuck the mothafuckers. I'm anti all that bullshit that they on\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\n(Shit shit shit shit, mic check 1, 2)\nDownload this on the down low bitch\nI'mma amputate your fingers and the clown won't miss, nigga\nFuck everything that ain't righteous\nSpotify the reason the music became lifeless\n70% of a fraction of a penny is a game crisis\nMake a nigga wanna blow up they headquarters and blame ISIS\nI'm watching the riot from Michael Brown\nAnd I see a crazy nigga yell let's burn this bitch down\nWhy niggas, you fuck up the O'Reilly's\nThe BBQ spot and then the beauty supply niggas?\nDepreciating, for justice keep waiting\n'Cause you burned up everything except the police station\nI'm anti stupid shit, for ladies participating come and loot this dick\nThey been out and murdered Kendrick Johnson\nAnd covered it up, watch my sin get Compton!\nYou hate me 'cause tough and freely's the tone\nI ain't never shopped on Black Friday, nigga, leave me alone!\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nI'm still smiling\nWhile I'm crying\n\n[Chorus: Band of Psychos]\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nI'm anti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuuuck!\nGo!\n\n[Verse 2:Krizz Kaliko]\nAhha! Listen!\nCOINTELPRO we livin' it out\nUsed to love turkey, devour Thanksgiving about\nJack your land from the Indians and murk 'em on it\nMake it bigger, then get the niggers to come and walk upon it\nGive 'em drugs and guns and excuses to never be\nBetter than a C-R-I-P or rep the letter B\nShow you you can YouTube it and make fights\nVatican at it again, bangin' for they gay rights\nAnd I'm supposed to follow YOU to the Promised Land?\nI ain't got no insurance, leave it in Obama's hand!\nAt 19 I slapped the shit out a cop!\nNow Ferguson had me murderin', burn down a donut shop!\nYou dumb niggas! Ooh, you'll be the only bum niggas\nGet your ass out the street 'fore I shoot me more than one nigga\nBill Cosby? WHAT THE FUCK?\nI was ridin' with you, till the 20th bitch got stuck\nI guess the Jell-O Pudding Popped her\nMy mellow, he couldn't stop\nHe would give 'em the Spanish Fly\nBut fuck it, so would I!\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nI'm still smiling\nWhile I'm crying\n\n[Chorus: Band of Psychos]\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nI'm anti as fuck\nAnti as fuck\nAnti as fuuuck!\nGo!"

Who's this? Baby, why you do this?\nI'm sittin' here with another female and it's 'posed to be exclusive\nBeauty, fully loaded booty hips and thighs\nI want a raspberry lemonade, baby, and whatever yo name is on the side\nYou speak unique, beautiful teeth I just peeped\nIt's makin' me weak to the point I can't even eat\n'Cause you give me butterflies, them butter thighs need to be publicized\nA wonderful face and waist that's great and there's no mistake that I love the eyes\nNever like them other guys, 'cause when I want it I'm on it\nThe way I'm watchin' you feel uncomfortable, don't it?\nBut I'm thinkin' you should be in movies and this you need to quit\nThen suddenly under my table I got a kick\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress\nI'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress\nCan't think of eatin', man, my girl will really hate this\nI'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress\nAnd I like the way the waitress (work that, work that)\nCome get your money, girl, and (work that, work that)\nI really like the way you (work that, work that)\nCan I get you on the floor? (Work that, work that)\nThe waitress got it goin' on\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nTake my order anytime, I come here many times\nA week so she can give me mine, baby girl is plenty fine\nBusiness meeting, Capital Grill, was sippin' when she caught my eye\nWhen she came over to us I said, \"Can I get yo number on the fly?\"\nSmell like no other, look like she strip undercover\nWish I could follow her home and just say thank you to her mother\nAnother interested brother who'd love to become your lover\nBurn rubber to the spot to tell my dogs how much I dug ya\nOutta here but I'm not gonna leave this place without gettin' in yo face\nI'm not a disgrace so I gotta see how you taste\nAnd I move at a puma's pace\nSo baby please if you find the time to get up out the weeds\nI wanna make you my squeeze 'cause these other chicks you supersede\nI call her waitress and homie, I call him server\nThe waiter's a bloody murder, I never wanna hear no murmur no further\n'Cause she's bliss, I'm tryin' to get in yo mix\nI want you so my order you can 86\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress\nI'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress\nCan't think of eatin', man, my girl will really hate this\nI'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress\nAnd I like the way the waitress (Work that, work that)\nCome get your money, girl, and (Work that, work that)\nI really like the way you (Work that, work that)\nCan I get you on the floor? (Work that, work that)\nThe waitress got it goin' on\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nAnd don't be tippin' her below 20 percent\nShe need plenty for rent, leave her with pennies, then see her vent\nTo get money's her purpose, you don't tip, go get burgers\nBelieve her's is for TEPS meaning Tuition Ensuring Prompt Service\nI'm nervous 'cause I'm gawkin' mom's curvage\nI'm beyond flirtish, us hookin' up we both concerted\nWhere you get that smell from? She would never tell one\nBut she told me this, she say me she liked me 'cause I'm well done\nNow your girl lookin' real, real stanky, ain't she?\n'Cause she know you lookin' at the waitress thinkin' hanky-panky\nHer attitude is wonderful, even got the strength to thank me\nEven though she a single parent breakin' her back but ain't so cranky\nI had to make her my girl, now she gon' eat with me\nSouthern booty, mane, I truly never need to flee\nI'm stayin' focused, the waitress got me posted\nBut dwamn, look at that booty on the hostess...\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress\nI'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress\nCan't think of eatin', man, my girl will really hate this\nI'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress\nAnd I like the way the waitress (Work that, work that)\nCome get your money, girl, and (Work that, work that)\nI really like the way you (Work that, work that)\nCan I get you on the floor? (Work that, work that)\nThe waitress got it goin' on\n\n[Outro]\nWork that, work that-that-that\nWork that, work that-that-that\nWork that, work that-that-that\nWork that, work that-that-that"

I got the \"ooh\" weed, ah!\n\n[Verse 2: Bernz]\nOpen up my eyes and eat some roaches for my breakfast\nDon't know where I am 'cause lately I been living reckless\nDig 'em out the ashtray, smoke 'em 'till I'm breathless\nSoaking up the high and try to focus on my next shit\nToking on that lion 'till I spot other dimensions\nFuck a GPS, my dude too high to get reception\nI been on a mission, just to get us all that necklace\nHitting every city with the motherfucking vengeance\nMaybe it's in excess, maybe it's expected\nMaybe you can blame it on material possessions\nWhen I'm getting high it's when I tell you my direction\nBut if it's up to me I'd rather lie and give y'all guessing\nEvery single morning I'm just smoking on my blessings\nMix a little coffee with my cannabis and exit\nI know it's infectious, a spiritual connection\nI get when I wake up and turn into the smoking session\n\n[Pre-Hook: Tech N9ne]\nGot them vape toys\nThat creates joy\nSuch a great choice\nWake and bake, boy\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\n(Wake and bake!)\nWhen I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!\n(Wake and bake!)\nPuffing on the loud, we gon' make the clouds bigger!\n(Wake and bake!)\nWhen I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!\n(Wake and bake!)\nOh no, no, no, don't sleep!

Sho Nuff!\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nI been at the bottom where they fought and then they shot 'em\nWas a problem summer, winter, spring and autumn\nGotta pray to God is what they taught 'em\nHavin' not is what they got, so you right up in the column\nUnless you got the will to go and get it\nUnless you find a lick and go and hit it\nI didn't bitch, I didn't march or picket\nI just kick 'em something wicked then it turned into a ticket\nWent from fights in school\nTo partyin' on stage where the hip-hop junkies Nice and Smooth\nWay back in the day then Quincy J gave me a brightened view\nTold me to rap what you know, took his advice then grew\nSick mother with no father, but still I made it as a scholar\nBut now I got to pop a collar, 'cause I started deep in squalor then I made some million dollars\nI'd like to thank everybody that showed up\nNow we 'bout to get poured up\n'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough\nSo is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!\n\n[Chorus]\nEven though we had a lot of nothin,' were we poor? Sho Nuff!\nDid we find a better way of livin' through this flow? Sho Nuff!\nComing up feeling good right now\nLot of love in the hood right now\nTell me something if you ain't a hater, do we go? Sho Nuff!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember rubber sole footies on my feet\nIn the dead of winter, freezin' cold, walkin' in the streets\nOff to 7-Eleven, only had enough to eat\nA bag of Doritos with the chili and cheese inside 'em, it was cheap\nMomma in the hospital, 17 I got little copped vittles\nPushing the bricks, scrubbing off the hot griddle\nToo much struggle to tell y'all\nBut it ain't so much that I quit and stop makin' my mail tall\nAw hell nah! Made it through the rainy day\nNever liked the devil and the games he play\nEven though we in a gang, we pray\nYeah we broke the chains and the money and the fame, we slay\nUse to be a man with no hope\nNow to all my many fans I'm a G.O.A.T. (I'm the G.O.A.T.)\nMy struggle was a blast in the past\nNow I'm gonna lift my glass 'cause I wanna make a toast\n\"I'd like to thank everybody that showed up\nNow we 'bout to get poured up\n'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough\nSo is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nEven though we had a lot of nothin', were we poor? Sho Nuff!\nDid we find a better way of livin' through this flow? Sho Nuff!\nComing up feeling good right now\nLot of love in the hood right now\nTell me something if you ain't a hater, do we go? Sho Nuff!\nEven though we had a lot of nothin', were we poor? Sho Nuff!\nDid we find a better way of livin' through this flow? Sho Nuff!\nComing up feeling good right now\nLot of love in the hood right now\nTell me something if you ain't a hater, do we go?

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI think very deeply\nScary creepy, fairly geeky, rarely beefy\nBut whoever the best is can barely beat me\nI think a lot of them are there beneath me\nLike a cherry piece, she see-pee\nRock the hoe, drop the dough\nNow she begging me not to go, bitch I don't care, release me\nI think that was my young life, I think now that I'm sun-bright\nLike the darker with some sight, coming from fright\nGunfights releasing, gesundheit\nI think if your lips are running, th\u0435 blicks are brung in\nAnd I think if anybody fuck with Eminem or Royce, th\u0435 crips are coming\nIt's what I think\n\n[Verse 2: JL]\nWhen I think about it, what is harder? Squad at a goal like soccer\nHat full of stars, no Lauper, ain't no ceilings, Wayne Carter\nSomething in the water\nTrack full of bars, no shocker, back full of scars, no doctor\nNeed to see me, I'm a rockstar\nMust have forgotten that I came from the bottom, know every shortcut like a barber shop\nAnd knots on my head like blaze, slick back, catch a fade\nYou can get a box if a kid wanna play, get drug chop a loose end off in this lane\nI'ma light 'em up, brush 'em off then spray\nIf you do rag on me for the wave\nGet your buzz-cut like clippers unplugged\nNigga really studied every trick in the trade\n\n[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]\nGot a lot of options, my opps can tell you they all deleted\nThat oxygen it be obsolete shit then all depleted\nCome a lot more rocka, I'm shooting vodka in coliseums\nThey try to block 'em, my Kawasaki, you bottom feeders\nDon't nobody really wanna come fuck with squad in pardon\nFar I'ma get 'em in a Harlem brawl, this laudin' holler Mazel Tov\nHe don't want no problem, man, his problem's off\nOne headshot, it be vitals lost\nHimmi\n\n[Verse 4: Joey Cool]\nI think I'm finna be fine by the design, due to me time\nAnd it feed N9ne, see that he shine, the elite grind, so they be lying\nAnd they try to bring down but he keep climb\nAnd the noise getting out, better keep calm\nAnd they try to bring foul play and grime\nWe all know that's a lot, gotta rewind\nJoe Cool, he done went coastal, bragging about through Malibu, Nobu\nY'all really wanna know what he go through? Been a hoe, boo, soft flow back in '02\nWhat I'm thinking is that you niggas better back up\nBlack on you niggas stack, homie better catch up\nHalf of these niggas attack when they try'na test us\nYapping, better get to scratch, nigga better bless up\n\n[Verse 5: King Iso]\nI think I'ma kick it with a thought for the night\nI ain't talking 'bout no bitches, but I'm lost in my mind\nAnd I think a lot of niggas want the spot that is mine\nPut a dot on your eye just for crossing the line\nI think that I'm alone because the positive vibes\nAnd I think I got Corona, better toss me a line\nBecause the suicide attempts, I think I've already died\nAnd your God is a liar, 2Pac is alive\nThink I sold more drugs than a doctor prescribes\nDoing two white lines like a new Dodge Viper\nI think rappers' in the Matrix, do not cypher\nNo kidding, but I gotta ask, \"Who got diapers?\"\nYelling \"Who up?\", I shoot up but feel like dice\nI think I'm too hot for you broads, and you not nicer\nEatin' goulash on new plates, do all China\nGoing snake and bat shit like Wuhan diners\n\n[Verse 6: Krizz Kaliko]\nKali Baby and this is my opinion\nJust getting by until he fly and claim his own dominion\nNot the fittest guy, I'm criticized, I smile but I'm pretending\nLook him up in his eyes, vitiligo, might have been a psycho, I feel different\nAll of these niggas is just a derivative of me, I need 'em, I'm getting belligerent\nWho gave 'em tickets to pick off their fleas and they flick off more sweets that's for feeding my children\nI'm just try'na stay sane, shit just ain't the same\nI'm just saying \"Somehow today I felt everything had changed\"\nBut I be believing in a minute\n\n[Verse 7: Jehry Robinson]\nAll I really got is time, I'm a young buck\nHit by both sides like a nun-chuck\nBeen high, no lie, I'm a bum-fuck\nOne touch and I'm throwing all these guns up\nWe done did, motherfuckers never done stuff\nOne puff and your eyes looking fucked up\nDeep cut with a knife, coming undone\nTied up, all of 'em in a dungeon\nRun, run, is it really fun? It's disgusting\nHustling, I been on my grind, it's a luck thing\nSo I got no problems with all of these losers, these losers got problems with me\nYeah I might just throw 'em a couple of dollars and tell 'em to go shoot capris\nYou shooting at who? You shooting at me?\nThis cannot be true, no, it cannot be\n\n[Verse 8: Wrekonize]\nI been sinking down into the depths like quicksand with a red stripe\nI been fucked before, so don't trust the Lord, I got no faith for the blessed hype\nI got bars dropping like an airstrike, kinda hard for us to fare right?\nWhen the cream don't really rise up like it used to\nOur clique is so consistent with the hits so you'd just have to be a skitzo\nTo be unsure that \u00a1MAYDAY! is still the shit bro\nI calypso on your tombstone for even thinking you could take a snooze slow\nY'all want a hit? Come holler at the goons, that's what I think\n\n[Verse 9: Bernz]\n'Cause this one's for the kids, this one's for the kids, ignorance is bliss\n'Til they come for every little fucking thing, and ain't that 'bout a bitch\nBut I down a fifth, 'boutta make a hit\nBoutta get away to my cave and prepare for nuclear waste\nThey always doing too much, always divide and conquer\nGot my Flor de Ca\u00f1a and flowers for Santa Barbara\nI'ma show you how, and I'm gon' tell you 'til I come down\nI'ma go get me some indo- now, kill the noise when I make it loud\n\n[Verse 10: Maez301]\nDouble entendre, mom said a mantra\nShe off in division of energy, let me conquer\nSickenin' doctors, and hospices, moccasins while I'm taking call conferences\nYeah you don't got your heart in this, I bleed this, make enemies ovules\nKnocking the vision, ain't nobody hot as this, rocking any bitch niggas talking shit\nLook, I'm a role model at this, no cuss words when I talk to the kids\nShe give me brain like \"Hop on this shit\", pussy and it's feeling so we hop in this shit\nPassing the six, infinite bliss, heroine flow when I'm mopping at this\nBatman, no I'm Robin at this, 'cept when the mask on, robbin' his clique\n\n[Verse 11: Ubi]\nKeep it real fair while they still can't understand how I could just kill a man\nNever realized I could see inside of a killer mind like I'm Will Graham\nMost certainly hold currency like a Brinks team, no security\nCurious why you ain't never heard of me? 'Cause I sink deep while they stirring tea\nSubterranean alien, stunned and gunning over greedy beats\nFake bulletins, they full of shit, plumming, running under city streets\nNothing worse than a pipe dream, want smoke? Better know that my team-\nWith the hijinx that determ' why eyes pink bruh\nYou don't wanna know what I think\n\n[Verse 12: Godemis]\nWhy do they wanna be all on me like I was catering? Told 'em I play to win\nHaters who waited on me to be caving in gotta come up with a whole 'nother way to win\nDumping that paddle on top of the paint again, breaking the chain to get over the gate again\nFeeling so livid the minute I made it in, head over heels when they comin' to hate on it\nBut it never matted like the weather patterin'\nSo every father-fucking head I'm gathering is stones to wrap around the wrings of Saturn\nAnd I'm more than happy that I had to pack 'em in\nGet a dick fulla' for fucking with the Deevil\nI'm a curse of the worst version of he who can eat people"

Maybe\nShe bent over and said thanks and I whispered in her ear\n\n[Hook]\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell she asked me for a lap dance\nAnd Trav said she too fine, fat chance\nBoy I'm Tech N9ne I rap and\nI slap hands with millionaires and plus I got stacks man\nShe approached me slowly, holy moly\nChef Boyardee, cheese and beef ravioli\nHold me close, nose be ope\nHow much evil can dough provoke\nHow much she told me nope\n'Cause this one was on her\nI'm hoping I can get the chance to put it on her\nShe slithered on me, put the booty in my lap and got to gyrating\nWas I waiting for the pushing, grabbing and vibrating\nBut this is really when my pupils got to dilating\nWhat kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing\nOver and over tried to explain it the best that I could\nShe put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said\nHgrrrrrr\n\n[Interlude]\nShit\nYou like that baby?\nHow about me and you leave here baby so we can do that shit you just did over and over again\n\n[Hook]\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nSaid she needed 400 to tip out\nI whip out the grip so quick so we can dip out\nThe trick house, told my homies not to poke they lip out\nI'm going to rip out the guts and try to throw my hip out\nNow it's time to trip out, got at the bitch house\nWas three fine female roommates my homies missed out\nTook me to her room and threw me right on the bed\nGot right on the head, what a wonderful night it was said\nThen along came three 36 double D's\nSizes kissing and licking on me\nAnd they coming to do what? Wake my dude up\nBut one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood\nThen the other and the others\nInstead of bud lovers I'm trapped with blood sucking motherfuckers for eternity\nBrought me here to straight feed on a nigga\nAll because I said to a stripper\nI love the way you make it slitha"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nTo the people I might offend with this song, forgive me\nIt's just, some sick shit that I was thinkin'\nWhen I was dealing with some real shit\nAnd it's called \"Should I Killer?\"\n\n[Hook]\nI can't hold her, I can't control her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nIf I can't grope her, I might as well choke her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nI can't hold her, I can't control her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nIf I can't grope her, I might as well choke her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe condom busted, upon this fluff chick\nReally bomb and lust when vagina's thrusted and I'm disgusted\nCan't come in the club bitch, dumb nigga trusted\nI won't hit a gust quick, son should've clutched it\nWhat he spit, what he gunned this let it in her rump and erupted\nShe say she know no pill, she stay thinking on your scrill\nShe know you're sold your mill and you Tecca Ninna with the solo deal\nSo what you think she's thinking?\nIf you fertilize the pink one, sinking your linking\nNothing but the jinx, now I gotta write her off like an ink pen\nIf she fattens, she said that it won't happen\nSteady laughing at him, mashing, splashing ass, should've had it fastened\nNight is over now, she ain't showed around, town about a month\nAnd I gotta call saying she gotta tote around\nSomething extra from when I sexed her\nMy nigga, that's the, moment I had a heap, a whole plethora\nOf homicide thoughts... Can I kill her? Why not?\nCause if wifey find this out, she's gonna take everything I got, nigga\n\n[Hook]\nI can't hold her, I can't control her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nIf I can't grope her, I might as well choke her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nI can't hold her, I can't control her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nIf I can't grope her, I might as well choke her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nKiller shit, I played it out, abortion, yes, I paid it out\nBut every time that I call to see if it's done, it's like she waited out\nLike, \"I got to be further along to get that\"\n\"Somebody's calling my phone, so hit back\"\nI guess I've been having a dome to click clack\nBone to pick, that's wrong to sit back\nAnd let yourself protrude from something else, no food\nWhat, you're gonna tell your dude that you're having my baby?\nWhat the hell? That's rude!\nBut you took my money and all my calmness from me\nBut you reassured me saying she's gonna be taken by her mommy\nWhen her mama took her, she said it kind of shook her\nWhen her mother cried and told her that God had wanted this baby to push her\nTo be a better person, read a verse, then yeah they burst in tears\nDead is certain, I ain't shed and cursed in years\nAnd as sick is here, make a nigga wanna drip a tear\nMan, this is fear, cause I already got kids and the missus near\nSo I'm vicious, steered, twisted admist this wicked sphere\nThink I'm gonna clip this weird chick\nReally quick and the bitch just disappeared\n\n[Hook]\nI can't hold her, I can't control her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nIf I can't grope her, I might as well choke her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nI can't hold her, I can't control her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\nIf I can't grope her, I might as well choke her\nCould I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)\n\n[Outro]\nIf I kill this woman, I gotta apply my stealth\nCause if my family finds out, wave bye-bye my wealth\nAnd if her family finds out, they're gonna make this guy cry help\nI guess it be way, way easier, for me to just die myself\n(Hey, just calling to let you know, everything's done, my mom took me)\n(You know, if you really loved me, you would have let me keep it)\n(Alright, talk to you later)"

(Bullshit)\nA N9cian know that I'm so fit to go with the dopest and know they fa sho get the bidness (Full clip)\nI am kingly but I'm treated like I'm some kind of genie\nRubbing the lamp and I'm hella dreamy\nPeople that stream me 'cause of \"Caribou Lou\" and the little teenies, they banging the record but never seen me\nYou heard the handle, claimin' you never heard the jam though\nFlowin' I got the words to ramble\nI murder fammo, I'm money like a bird in a bando\nMythical, so they burn a candle\nWhen they talk about this person, I'm a sick earthlin'\nHeard I was a devil and now they're disbursin'\n'92 rappin' backwards I get workin'\nA decade later I hear some gnarly ish yerfin\nIt\u2019s like I don\u2019t exist sometimes\nThinkin\u2019, \"How is it possible to miss some rhymes?\"\nThat were put together to make a hit, dumb minds\nCouldn\u2019t keep up the cadence of the sticks, drum line\nI\u2019m down with the stable and got the sick combined\nMy imagery made \u2018em all wanna split from mine\nRedheaded when it wasn\u2019t the shit, shun N9ne\nNow it\u2019s poppin\u2019, yo can a nigga get some shine?\n\n[Chorus: Crystal Watson & Tech N9ne]\nI've seen you with my own eyes\nThat I feel so alive\nI believe he lives forever\nSpecter, specter, specter, specter\n\n[Post-Chorus: Tech N9ne]\nBeware the ghost of E.B.A.H\nIf you deny the name\nIn time the ghost will greet ya\nThen it will supply the reign\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nHow else you explain it?\nOne of the best to obtain it\nBut so many claim they not acquainted\nBut they know the name is famous\nAnd Strange is painted the best but never aim to bang it\n'Cause of backstory that I'm that gory\nLike I got an evil entity to rap for me\nOn a fat chory but the math surely\nThey ain't fuckin' with me like I gotta scratch orgy off the list\nWhat does it cost to get the main line to gain shine off the rip?\nThe hang time to bang mine lost the grip then\nInsane rhymes that came flyin' caused the split\nPressure for the large investor\n'Cause it is hard to measure carbon texture\nTech's your resurrector, the soul injector\nBut for the whole semester they closed the lecture for the specter\n\n[Chorus: Crystal Watson & Tech N9ne]\nI've seen you with my own eyes\nThat I feel so alive\nI believe he lives forever\nSpecter, specter, specter, specter\n\n[Post-Chorus: Tech N9ne]\nBeware the ghost of E.B.A.H\nIf you deny the name\nIn time the ghost will greet ya\nThen it will supply the reign"

Say that your iron squirt\nWhen you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)\nIf suckers still on that hatin' shit\nI'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips\nI'll bend they ass up like a paper clip\nTech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip\n\n[Hook]\nI'm in the air\nHigh in the air\nI'm in the air\nHigh in the air\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is\nWhy call me underground when I rock the stars?\nAnd even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars\nMy hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars\nOne-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight ajar\nYou want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system\nCause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die\nMack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?\nCivilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky\nCall me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor\nBlasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma\nIn the air like Dancer and Dasher\nHigh in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska\nHigher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya\nSuper-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture\nThe wack, I will cast ya down below those who get caught up in my rapture\nDon't be callin' me \"dog\" cause I want you to say it backwards\n\n[Hook]\nI'm in the air\nHigh in the air\nI'm in the air\nHigh in the air\nI'm in the air\nHigh in the air\nI'm in the air\nHigh in the air\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nYour first lesson for today man\nThat was it, Sickology 101\nYaddada mean\nCraig Smith, Nesto, Tech Nina nigga\nIn the air, motherfucker\nSound like a bird flying around\nYeah, Wyshmaster on the track\nWe out this bitch"

(So, so, so)\n(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)\nSo overwhelming!(So, so, so)\n(Yeah, ay, it kept me alive yeah!)\nOverwhelming! (So, so, so)\n(Yeah, your love is so, its so, so!)\nSo overwhelming!(So, so, so)\n(Yeah, it kept me alive yeah, yeah, come on!)\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nBack in the days I went through visions\nIn my head, dreams that you'd listen\nBut my wonderful fans they came\nAnd made it all come to fruition\nSometimes with the females\nI'll straight show my gratitude through kissin'\nOn the cheek, for the youngsters, foreheads\nOr a legal pound for the fella's that screw vixens\nWay back then I was bitter, was unused my music is litter\nSo mad and I'm mad I got jitters\nDidn't consider that in a second I would be bigger\nThe label found that I was a hard hitter\nI'd give'r shit was delivered hella hard from a spitter, gritter\nRecognizing all the humongous love I'd get\nOn Facebook and positive messages on Twitter\nThis is how I tell you, thank you\nTo all of my fans, I thank you\nAnd you can tell all those suckers\nThat hate on the Nina they just upset that they ain't you\nCause their favorite artist is lame\nAnd neglects his fans, he does do\nBut your favorite artist goes out of his way\nTo show you that he loves you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nSo here's to all of my fans\nYou're making my dreams come true\nYou helped me create this land\nBy believing that this one new\nThat one is N9ne, you brung\nHis time to everyone and rhymed\nAll though some is blind you brung\nHis lines to the sun and shined\nTechnician hunts, keeping my every condition pumped\nGiving you what your suspicion wants\nWaking up these hissing punks\nTo the early Strange fans\nThank you for feeling my pain man\nBut for the newbies - I'm so, so glad\nThat you made it, welcome to Strangeland\nThe tattoos, the tears, the gratitude, the years\nMy life's my debt through sound\nThank you, cause Tech you found\nJust know that I'm thankful and\nI will never ever let you down\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nWow, thank you to all who love me\nI mean it more than you know\nI love you for feeling my music\nAnd coming to every show\nAnd I will forever be there\nThrough rain, sleet or snow\nYou're right there with the stars\nKrizz and Kutty now there's only one\nOther place that we can go"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne]\nI got a story to tell, 'bout when I ginormously fell\nWon't say no names though, 'cause it ain't no game, bro\nAnd it ain't no angle makin' no woof tickets for me to sell\nIt's about two buddies in the middle of bout due\nA lady on the daily puttin' out to\nOne of the buddies, she told him never let his mouth spew\nDon't let your boy know what's happenin'\n'Cause we were together, plus shackin' in\nThat's what you call get some back in friends\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne & Joey Cool]\nI was twenty-one\nShe was 40-somethin', say she wanna give me some\nSo I started puttin' Tecca Ninna in the lungs\nOf the photographer that my homie Brian B'zle brung\nBut it was a catch, she didn't want a nigga to rack\n'Cause her and my homie were together, he'd give her the scratch\nAfter every photo-shoot but he'd have a bitter attack\nIf he knew his colleague would shoot me then deliver the snatch\nSo I kept her secret like a dummy, keepin' it professional\nI didn't tell my homie but I was full of regret, you know?\nRidin' out with my homie, out my mouth, ain't no decibels\n'Bout when she finished flickin' me, we'd bang out on the sectional\nI used to throw him hints sayin', \"I really wanna smash her\"\nThen he would look at me like I was done it with laughter said\n\"She would never do it, I don't know what you after\nOut of your league, man you young, broke and plus you a rapper\"\nDamn\n\n[Hook: Darrein Safron, Joey Cool & Tech N9ne]\nBros become foes yeah (bros become foes)\nLord knows the lovin' was fly though\nIt ain't worth livin' these lies though\nOn my dog (On my dog, On my dog)\nYeah\nI should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him\nThat I was tappin' in\nI should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him\n'Cause he was a best friend\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nThat ain't never what you do to best friends\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne & Joey Cool]\nShe would pick me up for photo sessions\nBut I didn't tell my homie we were low-low sexin'\nMan this lady had a body like she was SoloFlex'n\nSo right after work, she let me give her a pogo lesson\nNo confession never told him, I was grindin'\nOn his workin' roommate, I was slimin'\nBut I messed up and told my other homie Big Nick\nBut when me and him fell out he told my best friend\nThat I was lyin' all this time and then my homie said\nWhy is you playin' me, I'm hearing too many rumors\nYo you got something to say to me, man?\nYou know about my affection for that woman that stay with me\nYou supposed to be my homie, why you fuckin' and fakin'?\nAnd then I gotta hear from someone else\nYou selfish man all you think about is your fuckin' self\nYou and her be together, I don't need no one's help\nI'm feel like I'm finna lose it, I don't know what I'ma do\nBut I swear to...\nHold on my nigga, you can't be callin' me trippin'\nI'm with my family and I don't know what the hell you talkin' 'bout that's fuckin' insanity man\nWhy you lyin' to me bro, you know these people be talkin'\nAnd their stories sound the same and you makin' it awkward\nAnd I ain't finna be the type to act like this don't really hurts\nWhat am I supposed to do 'bout it when I'm at work?\nYou and her, we supposed to be brothers that make it worse\nAnd he told me everything y'all be doin', don't do me dirt\nDon't deny it homie, really you oversteppin' your turf\nTold me y'all was snappin' photos and you removin' her skirt\nEven said I shoulda known this fuckin' chick was a flirt\nWell how you gonna believe every damn thing he say?\nDog you for real? You shoulda told me without a delay\nWe was like fam, now you got me dealin' with hearsay\nAnd everything that he say, she say\nOh, I gotta go\n\n[Hook: Darrein Safron, Joey Cool & Tech N9ne]\nBros become foes yeah (bros become foes)\nLord knows the lovin' was fly though\nIt ain't worth livin' these lies though\nOn my dog (On my dog, On my dog)\nYeah\nI should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him\nThat I was tappin' in\nI should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him\n'Cause he was a best friend\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nThat ain't never what you do to best friends\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nSo that is how me and my best friend fell out\n'Cause I told another homie something he had to yell out\nAll of our bidness ventures and dreams was the hell out\nAnd I'm left with underhanded things that I can tell 'bout\nLost my best friend, 'cause I was young and dumb\nHe lost his life to another brother with a gun\nI never got to tell him that I was sorry, I was sprung\nMy other homie just died of cancer, I'm numb\nSo the moral of the story is don't\nLie to get something that you really want\nAlways keep it real, though a lot of people don't\nThat's why they always in funk\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\nThat ain't never what you do to best friends"

I ain't met one person that could maintain righteousness\nKnow what I'm sayin'?\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nA wise man told me evil was lurkin' and if you found it\nTry your best to not put yourself around it\n'Cause when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but\nThen it\u2019s the sin you begin it, then wish that you stayed grounded\nI went all over the world and I done been through it\nAt the beginning, I knew I wouldn't give in to it\nBut temptation, oh what the sensation\nWomen I am embracin', so many of them waitin'\nContemplatin' how to get fornication\nAt yo door when it's late with the motivation of Satan\nSo they say, but things go they way\nAnd it's more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today\nBut lust it sets in, and crush your chest in\nFor dust you're destined, if drugs are let in\nEnough to nest in, prolly make you punch your best friend\nAnd next kin 'cause you let S-E-X win\nYou mean to tell me you can fight this land\nWith brightness and walk the path of the righteous man?\nYo, I wanna believe that, itching to see that\nIf a positive person can shake the negative feedback\nThat this life has to offer when it's faster\nWhat a disaster if you didn't obey the master\n'Cause that's mutiny, it would be new to me\nIf you was on tour with Tecca N9na and still you could be\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) I know you'll be strong, but you've been gone a\n(While) I know you still my\n(Child) So I'm pullin' for you\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the\n(Clouds) You're holier than\n(Thou) So I say it for you\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nHow can I move the crowd without losin' out on my faith?\nLucifer out of the way (way)\nOr maybe he don't even exist\nI ain't gotta trip off gettin' hookers out of my system (get you out of my system)\nSee that's how he tricks 'em\nGet 'em sippin' then a big ol' mickey he slips them (I wonder why)\nMusic soothes the savage soul\nPeople can lose it when we lack control\nReally get used to livin' fast and so\nWe smashin' women then they bypass they soul\nThey believin' everything we breathin'\nHalf of us is Jesus, the other half is heathen\nAnd how we get that bad half out?\nWe pray the Lord'll cast that out\nHope he got blessings left and pass that out\nWhen we travellin' and pass that route\nKeep us under your graces in places where we have that doubt\nWhere I stand, he's pointin' at me, but it's with my hand\nI need you, you holier than I am, I am\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) I know you'll be strong, but you've been gone a\n(While) I know you still my\n(Child) So I'm pullin' for you\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the\n(Clouds) You're holier than\n(Thou) So I say it for you\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nThis verse was intended for a gospel rapper\nThat we all admire and he goes by the name of Da' T.R.U.T.H\nAll we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction\nAnd maybe if he came we could change and regroup\nSo we laid it down and sent it hopin' he would rap wit' us, track splittas\nWaited, and none of his people got back wit' us\nWe kept callin' and they finally answered, when a month passed\nWe was prepared to do whatever, give it if he wants cash\nBut the lady who represent him would never send him a message from a secular messenger\nNever be no nepotism, we s'posed to be brothers, on the road to teach others\nBut the flow would be covered, better mess with the Tech they know that we smother\nAnybody that diss us, retired of they weak flow\n'Cause this is the pinnacle, nobody flyer than me, bro\nIf you didn't like it then I admire the ego\nAnd if they never told you, then you better fire ya people\n'Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em\nBut Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims\nBut they always helpin' in the hood, but y'all closed me out\nY'all didn't even really wanna know what we 'bout\nAnd we bombay, T.R.U.T.H ain\u2019t on this, so the Don' spray\nAnd I had to spit on it 'cause I couldn't afford Kanye\nI needed help, your people showed me the wall\nBelow me is y'all, I guess y'all wasn't holy at all... naw!\n\n[Interlude: Tech N9ne]\nMuch love to the gospel MC J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation\nEven though most if his peers told him not to 'cause we secular MCs\nThanks for giving me Da' T.R.U.T.H. CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro. God bless you, for being so\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) I know you'll be strong, but you've been gone a\n(While) While I know you still my\n(Child) Child, so I'm pullin' for you\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the\n(Clouds) Clouds, you're holier than\n(Thou) Thou, so I say it for you\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) Would you know me?\n(While) WHILE, WHILE\n(Child) You my child now\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look up above the\n(Clouds) You're holier than\n(Thou) Oooooooh... yeeeeaaaah"

You ain't heard of me gettin' paid bucks?\nTouring, y'all see me rippin' the stage up\n\n[Hook]\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nI'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang\nWhy you ain't?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been on tour with Hov, 'bout 27 shows\nWhy he ain't have me on a record only heaven knows\nMaybe he missed us, missin' the big picture\nThat this is a fixture, aw yeah, he got Twista!\nWell Twista's my homie and we both from the Midwest\nAnd I guess Hov ain't lookin' for another speedy rapper kid yet\nMe collaboratin' with them was all in me dreams\nMatter fact the only one of 'em called me was Beans\nHe told me he played you \"The Industry Is Punks\"\nAnd you loved it so you know Tech is what the industry would want\nI started down at the bottom, got with TOG and then it paid\nBut I would've loved to been on the third verse of \"Renegade\"\nThey must think I'm a stick of dynamite with no stem\nThat's probably why I got D12 but no Em!\nBut I burst flame and I bet that y'all know my first name\n'Cause I'm the hardest this side of Earth, mane\n\n[Hook]\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nI'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang\nWhy you ain't?\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis ain't no hate-mail, this a love letter\nI love you niggas' music and I hope it does better\nI just wish you woulda hit a brother that love cheddar\nBut I'm ballin' now and I'm better than I was EVER\nSpace age flows like Jesse and Primrose\nTenfold, I used to open-up, now I end shows\nGrim road, when you one of the best with slim dough\nAnd you ain't got Dre, Storch, Pharrell and no Timbo\nI've met almost half of the DTP\nBut the couple times I spoke to Luda, don't think he see me\nHad never met I-20 but he spoke at BET\nShawnna love me, Field Mob and Chingy decently speak me\nSo I'ma reiterate the game it's all fame\nAnd you don't get no play if you an emcee with a small name\nIf I wanna get on TV I guess I gotta call Pain\nAnd Nelly, my great-grandmother's name is Maude Haynes\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe I'm trippin', full of delusion\nMaybe it come from all the drugs I was usin'\nMaybe I am the best thing that you ever saw\nMaybe I'm wrong and you don't know me at all\nI guess I'm blinded, I got reminded\nThat none of you just will never know who the N9ne is\nAnd you never heard of the homie from the Show-me\nPUNK THAT! I know you niggas know me\n\n[Hook]\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nI'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nI'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang\nWhy you ain't?"

Never just have a ball wit' each other\n`Cause that's what I had thanks goes out to my father and mother\nAnd I love you, so mama, if I ever happen to go, mama\nI think there's something you should know, mama\nI stayed away `cause I was tryin' to become something\nGive a house to that one woman\nThe reason everyone's bumpin'\n\n[Hook] (2X)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet's take a journey startin' at 85th, wrote some of my latest hits\nOff '85th came back from Cali then I stayed with Krizz\nOff '76th my first baby was conceived\nOff '75th was with slow mo in conditions you wouldn't believe\n74th and Paseo on the corner, slept with the AK\nFor my homie Scoob anybody came through that door was a gonner\n64th I ate balogna and kicked it with mak and sonya\nIn French Village I sold dope for my folks in a place with a crack aroma\n63rd street is the landin' of Bishop Hogan\nDemandin' y'all just keep rollin' expandin' on bishop strollin'\nMastered music on 61st if I didn't use it I would spit the verse\nThis is how how you find me if demons happen to hit me first\nRight on 58th I lived from 12 to 17 with\nBasima kechramin, marty, hassan and hakim\n57th and 56th I had a ball I learned some tricks I learned some schemes\nFrom my homeboys, y'all know who I mean\nRDVs 55th paul's liquor try and talk slick if you crazy\nResults in getting stomped by doc and stu-baby\nKeep ridin' paseo for me if you rollin' solo tonight\nJust keep on thinkin' marco polo for life when you're\n\n[Hook] (2X)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat's the paseo, hah, 49th street\nOn 47th is gates and sons where Tech N9ne eats\n39th at the bootleg I used to find peace\nBut at the scottish right on lynnwood masons at times meet\nI used to kick it on 27th and 28th Troost Lake\nCareful... you might find yourself off in that piece if you hate\n19th was my family's church they tried to save me too late\n`Cause doin shows on 18th and vine that was my true fate\nMary Lou Williams was my aunt, 9th where I was raised\nWayne Minor way back in the day they used to fight no one was framed\nBut now on independence ave I hear my son donnie\nSayin' that he hear gunshots every night\nOn 5th and it scares his momma ronnie\nEnd of the road 29 north to the bridge\nIf I go im leavin' everything to my wife and my kids\nTravis if I go whatever my half is you give her\nAnd no funeral just throw my ashes in the Missouri River\nLove\n\n[Hook] (2X)"

I\nTalk until my face is blue.. I\nDon't look like I'm crazy do I?\nDo you feel me? *It's my last words*\nWhat more can I say to you?.. I\nTalk until my face is blue.. I\nDon't look like I'm crazy do I?\nCan you hear me? *It's my last words*\n\n[Dr. Frazier]\nTalk about some of the things that really eat away at you\nLike your career, your music...\nAnd don't hold back Aaron, 'cause again these sessions\nAre to extract the things that could possibly make you explode\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nWhen y'all listen to my music I think y'all take it lightly\nBut I been raw since the beginning just ask my Uncle Ikey\nHe will tell you royalty's been planted deep in my psyche\nAll you peasants hail the king just call me Aaron almighty\nSo when you critique my music you sound like fools to me\nAnd I don't think you deserve to hear another jewel from me\nThe industry cheated me, repeatedly cruel to me\nSo now I act conceited, guess you needed no grooves from me\nI've had it, I'm tired mane\nYou niggas is fired mane\n'Cause you know me and Travis was supposed to inherit the entire thang\nI'm normal, I've never admired fame\nI'm just famous 'cause I'm a fuckup and y'all desire pain\nSo don't talk to me when you see me\nAwfully's how you treat me\nOff of me, everybody leave me\nIt costed me, never was it easy\nSo say goodbye to the bad guy a nigga don't have anymore to sell you\nThis might be the last time you hear a bad guy like Tecca Nina baby, let me tell you\n\n[Outro: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]\nWhat more can I say to you?.. I (Yeah)\nTalk until my face is blue.. I\nDon't look like I'm crazy do I?\nDo you feel me? (Supposed to be more than this, man)\nWhat more can I say to you?.. I\nTalk until my face is blue.. I\nDon't look like I'm crazy do I?\nCan you hear me? (I'm outta here)\nSee I've been inside out\nY'all heard the best of it\nGot no more to give\nThere ain't no rest of it.. there\nI'm all out there but y'all don't care\nI got no more to bare, yeah\nWhat more can I say to you?.. I (That's right)\nTalk until my face is blue.. I (Fuck It)\nDon't look like I'm crazy do I?\nCan you feel me? (I gave everything I could give)\nWhat more can I say to you?.. I\nTalk until my face is blue.. I\nDon't look like I'm crazy do I?\nDo You feel me?\n\nI don't wanna hear nothin' else man, I just wanna\nGo somewhere with my children, man\nDisappear, like dear God\nMake me a bird so I can fly\nFly far away from here...\nTech N9ne"

Cause I'm the world's best kept secret\nLet me in the door\nIf you say you hear me knockin' what you standin' there for?\nCause I'm the one that do that music, you feel but you still refuse this\nLet me in the door\n\n[Verse 1: Ca$h Image]\nRight now 'fore my goons have to tear it down\nWe don't wait in line and we don't stand around\nWe in clubs and we draggin', actin' brand new\nActin like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot\nThey know I'm Ca$h Image and I'm with Tech N9ne\nAnd 'fore the club close the owner gon' respect mine\nWe spend a lot of money and that's the bottom line\nTen cars on chrome plus the neck shine\nBaggy jeans on and J's worth a lot of bucks\nAnd you ain't gotta know me, you can tell my dollars up\nPoppin' collars in the club, turn the bottles up\nAnd all the models in the club wanna follow us\nIt's Mr. Chevy man, you hear my song playin'\nAnd every time we in the club we be spending grands\nFirst deny Tech (What!?), then deny me (What!?)\nAnd I was number 1 on 103 for 40 weeks\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: D-Locc Da Chop]\nYou say you hear me knockin', so why you don't wanna let me in?\nBut I ain't buggin' so tell the cops to come and get me then\nComplain about my shoes ain't really talking bout shit\nDude, I spent like 350 on this outfit\nNV ain't gon' let me in seein' as he actin' funny with me\nWhat it gonna cost me, homie? I brought a little money with me\nI don't wear tight shirts, my pants kinda baggy\nKC hat tilted so now they wanna red flag me\nI buy the bar every time, point blank period\nThe doorman hatin', takin' his job too serious\nMe, Ca$h Image, Tech and Kaliko\nAbout big business so what I'm talking to a bouncer for?\nThe women see me scream my name like the announcer spoke\nThey actin' brand new this week so I'm about to go\nTo the block and bubble and get plenty cake\nI just wanted women and I don't like this club anyway\nSo fuck y'all!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI get money from music and I like to spend-spend\nWhen I hit the town I know they're gonna let me ins in\nBut these other clubs be trippin' like I begin sin\nYou hear me knockin'? (Aw yeah!) Well, let me in then!\nCause NV ain't so friendly, they got a gay assembly\nOf femmes who think the blacks be packin' semis\n(That's why they don't sell no Henny)\nStink butts who think bucks\nBut they don't know my bank account is like a Brink's truck!\nCould buy it any day, 2.1 on a new building and lease\nSome at The N9ne has plenty say\nThe rhymin' get me paid so I resign cause NVA\nAnd plus NV stands for no vaginas anyway\nThey place me and Lil' Weezy, we give no love\nThat's why when I brought Chingy in there and he peed in your club\nNot in the toilet either (No!), you don't enjoy the beaver (No!)\nYou'd rather plot on how to give a lil' your boy the peter\nAmerica's clubbin' phase two, I erase you\nMy pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too\nOrlando south races they treated me cold\nAnd Lucky Strike in Power and Light won't let the Nina in to bowl\nWhoa, guess my Dickies the wrong clothes\nPlay my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors\nOver one million records sold, lots of money to fold\nThey should let me in any club in (KC, MO!)\nAnd I'm the biggest tipper, bartenders know me well\nAnd waitresses love me so club owners: (Go to hell!)\nYou got that blow to sell, but you want this bro to fail\nWhen it really ain't me cause it is your destiny to go to jail\nAnd when you be serving you might see work\nOn Club Nina when you walk up you might be hurt\nYou might skee skirt, cause you ain't getting in if you ain't got a\n(KC hat and a white t-shirt, ey!)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nOnly reason I even go to the club is so I can listen to some loud music and drink, holler at a bianc\nMy neighbors be mad at me cause I be shakin' the whole block with my system\nSo that's why I go to the club\nI gotta work at the club, take pictures and sign autographs, yadada mean?\nI don't need to be in your club for real\nAnd club dollars say that I owe them 70 dollars\nI paid 125 dollars to get in\nWhy you trippin I just wanted to drink\nSo if 70 dollars is owed that means some cats were there after I left\nYa know what I mean ha ha put it on my tab\nI don't owe nobody shit"

Where they do that?\nWhy they do that? (what?)\nWhy they do that?\nWhy they do that?\n\n[Verse 1]\nRight here right now\nI really wanna know where the smoke and booze at\nI'm taking a off day, yup and I ain't 'bout to lose that\nI'm finna be absent like Bueller (Bueller)\nNow's the time, the time is happening like Mueller (Mueller)\nNot a hair has been seen, it's not an embarrassin' thing\nCallin' in, lyin' to kick, it's the American dream like\nI'm gonna blow a cone by the pool\nSmoke up to many songs, I can choose\nThen right to my phone, call my crew\nHit up Stevie Stone, Frizz, JL, and Joey Cool\nThat's diggable, now my homies is with me\nThat'll tell my chick, hit some hippie\nMake thickies, that's less miserable\nIn Tech's crib you know, everybody gonna get physical\nEat some food then turn on the tube for Netflickables\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna do a damn thing today\nDon't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay\nInstead of work, I just wanna play\nPlus I pulled away a fat stack anyway\nI don't wanna do a damn thing today\nDon't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay\nThey wanna know what I'ma do today\nNot a damn thing, fuck what anybody say\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat? Where they do that?\nWhere they do that?

I'd rather be looking at a pussy like that like \"Muah, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah!\" Sorry and shit\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nSorry and shit\n\n[Post-Hook: Tech N9ne]\nWe go, that's why she want us in her throat\nDon't bring her around us because we will get the vote\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nCause money and the power get your honey in the shower\nWith this one he got it runny in her flower\nWhen that whore see me rap\nYou won't be able to snatch your beezy back\nIt ain't no reason to act so sleazy cat\nMusic is some kind of aphrodisiac\nYou don't know she dreaming of having us in the sheets like\nLoving that nigga that eat right, what you expect?\nSee, if you were Tech you would be pounding punani each night\nIf she bites, tell her to stop! Then we fight\nNext minute, break up, then make up\nThat's what I call a peace pipe\nMy apologies, she wants Tech so she nollers me\nSwallows me, on my rod is where your broad'll be\nAnd your girl's a hella partying chick and she kiss it like\nMuah, muah, muah\nSorry and shit\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nSorry and shit\n\n[Post-Hook: Tech N9ne]\nWe dope, that's why she want us in her throat\nDon't bring her around us because we will get the vote\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nUh huh, 'em big ones huh?\nSo I dumps the pumps, her rump will hear that song and then she on my bumper\nAfter the show, watch how these hoes get (ya, ya!)\nCuties trying to kick it like a Colquitt\nShe just tryna' give me what I'm 'poda get\nI'm sober as a gopher, poke her and then I'm over it\n(Okay!) And I ain't slowing it down cause I got a goal to get\nI know what your motive is, but you roll it 'fore the morning hit\n(Okay!) I know she know just what a boner is\nShe phone the kids, she ain't coming home cause she on the dick\nW-why you fighting 'round them areolas\nMight be piping wives and them, like my rhymes reciting 'em\nAt the bar we can sit, drink and see how far we get\nMe and the Donny Punani we already hit\n(Sorry and shit) Okay!\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nSorry and shit\n\n[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]\nAye! We're some dudes they want to hug\nWant us in they throat cause we hard\nAnd give her what she missing at home\nFeelin' K9 and she'll be alone\nI see that snake and bat tat\nThen I'm at that, wanna give us head\nAround the map, you don't match that\nTalkin' bout, she love me now\nNow how hard it can get\nAnd I can tell her now she hardly can sit, yeah, yeah!\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nMuah, muah, muah, muah\nSorry and shit"

(yes)\nMeaning that under heat you wouldn't nare leak it\nSo when your woman's in your presence don't you dare speak it\nPillow talkin' get you caught up and brought up on charges\nShot up a lot and departed, it's nothin' short of retarded\n'Cause when you say stuff and then you and your woman break up\nYou funkin' because your mouth wouldn't stay shut\nHow could you spread that? Can't believe you said that\nPuttin' my life in jeopardy definitely it'll make the feds tap bed trap\nWhat you tell your lady can make you take a dead nap\nFluff up your pillow and lay your head back\n\n[Hook: Girl, Krizz Kaliko & (Tech N9ne)]\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin', don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin'\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nMy advice to niggas is this: you can never trust no chick\nIt don't matter how silky the ho can stroke your dick\nIt don't matter how slimy the pussy hole gon' get\nIf a nigga talks to these bitches these hoes gon' snitch\nShit, I used to fuck this bitch\nHad a husband with dope money and I had his snow bunny\nClimbin' at the bed poster, feedin' her dog meat\nIn love with the nine inch, she steady calls me\nTells me she's leavin', I know the reason\nShe know where the guns at, lock box, keys and\nThe floor safe combo and this here one ho\nWas this dude's bad news, knock on the front door\nA man in a police suit, a girl with a plot to\nGet to the money, she saw him countin' in the back room\nIt doesn't end here, the man with the cop suit\nShoots at the bitch once, pops and drops dude\n\n[Hook: Girl, Krizz Kaliko & (Tech N9ne)]\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you), don't be pillow talkin', don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin' don't say nothin'\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI can tell you what the problem is: people try to be monogamous\nTell his woman a lot of shit\nAnd he thinkin' he got him a bottom bitch\nStop with the sentimental talks at night\nIf you're pillow talkin', then you oughta quit\nWhen the heat come with the quickness\nLookin' for the witness, man your broad is it\nWhy you wanna spit it? I don't really get it\nGivin' your woman the power to speak in a minute\nSpeakin' about a brother wanna cover your mud up\nWith the N9na but you the only one know I really did it\nWhen it come back then you feel low\nBecause everyone know you ain't real though\n'Cause them beans you spillin'\nYou known for squealin' and all you needed was a pillow\n\"I should have did the dirt, all by my lonely\" like Treach say\nBut the company that you keep end up bein' phony\nSo the TEC spray\nNever let no chick I hit get with that homie\n'Cause the next day, she seein' right through me\nGot them lenses on me like an X-Ray\nAnd I'm fed up with these rappers\nWho be yappin' to these groupies\nThey flash them a little coochie\nThen you blab and try to reduce me\nAnd it always come back to me\nSo when I come through strapped with an Uzi\nIt ain't like \"Damn why'd he shoot me?\"\nUsin' the Nueve name too loosely\n\n[Hook: Girl, Krizz Kaliko & (Tech N9ne)]\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you), don't be pillow talkin', don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin' don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin' don't say nothin'\nYou"

Hell nah, got a lot of fans watching us\nSaying God to us, but if Strange came through the window pane of the mainstream's oculus\nIt'll leave a lot of rappers with their mouth wide, like \"The Ring\" when people went the TV route and died\nI'm without cries, 'cause me and my partner built an empire and we did it on the outside\n\n[Chorus]\nI get guap, I get guap, I get guap\nOn the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it\nI just watch, I just watch, I just watch\nOn the outside, here I come now\nI get guap, I get guap, I get guap\nOn the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it\nI just watch, I just watch, I just watch\nOn the outside, here I come now\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get guap still, even though people are not real\nWhen it come to who got skill, some just want a nigga pop pills\nI done did it, all fly, tongue splitter, y'all, I swung, hit a ball, dropped deals\nStarted my own and stocked mills, but I kinda sensed that blocked feel\nVery little radio and TV time, that's what the outside mean when I free these lines\nLike somebody determined to never see me shine, completely deep inside, I know they really dying to meet me\nTo be a household name like Snoop, really would feel like felicity\nBut I think it takes a bit of a brighter image and enough of the right publicity\nSo as I sit and peep award shows like I'm a forbidden geek\nIgnored so 'cause I love and live in deep where the lord flows through the blood of risen chiefs\nI love to see all of my peers getting their credit through all of my years\nOf eating the mic, I just swallow my fears, when beating this fight, never call on my tears\nEven though so many cry over Yates\nThe music business treat me like I'm a flyover state\nBut I work this glow, murk this flow, never been a day my clout died\nTech Nina, Strange Music, built that thing on the outside\n\n[Chorus]\nI get guap, I get guap, I get guap\nOn the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it\nI just watch, I just watch, I just watch\nOn the outside, here I come now\nI get guap, I get guap, I get guap\nOn the outside and when I'm home from gettin' it\nI just watch, I just watch, I just watch\nOn the outside, here I come now\n\n[Outro]\nI get guap, I get guap, I get guap\nHere I come baby, I'm coming to get ya (Get ya)\nI just watch, I just watch, I just watch\nAnd it's such a beautiful picture (Picture)\nI get guap, I get guap, I get guap\nAll year round, all day and night\nI just watch, I just watch, I just watch\nNo worries, everything's gonna be alright\nOn the outside"

when a Rogue sat, you trying to hold back his dough sack\nAnd try to bozack and he go cock the 4-4 back, you chose that\nSo cut these ties and I'll rise, let's compromise\nOr else I'll hop a plane with my guys\nQDIII said, \"It ain't all good, when you sign with a record label\nWho ain't had a hot soundtrack ever since Boyz N Da Hood\"\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nI'm going\nBad\nNo luck, I'm going\nBad, bad, bad\nSo rough I'm going\nBad, bad, bad\nNo church, I'm going\nBad, bad, bad\nDisperse I'm going\nBad\nFeel me out now\n\n[Hook: Charmelle]\nThis life I live ain't extra\nNo angels to stand next to\nTo live a life that's better\nI'll sacrifice whatever\nThis life I live ain't extra\nNo angels to stand next to\nTo live a life that's better\nI'll sacrifice whatever\n\n[Interlude: LeCoya LeJuene]\nNo one wants to see an angel in this world in these days\nTo them I am the epitome of evil\nA found soul looking to save the lost\nTo them I am death and of not wanting an evil man\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nFor living expenses they gave me like thirty-five G's\nPicture me in a hospital shot up with thirty IV's\nThat's what I really needed when I found out this drama trauma\nInstead of moving I should've kept all that and continued to stay with my girl's momma\nGutter living got me tripping I'm smoking bud daily\nGutter living got me tripping, I'm going blood crazy\nGutter living got me tripping, I'm struggling like a bad actor\nGutter living got me sounding like The Madd Rapper\nThe bad influence, the bad apple, the bad seed (That's me, yes)\nThe bad people, the bad karma, the bad breed\nMushroom tripping, brain's a mushroom cloud\nFinding groupies tugging on my zipper while I'm hanging on to my vows\nDemons surround me in triple stage darkness and taunt me\nThey know I'm the good guy going bad so they want me\nAll my family remembers way back in the day I was good but they doubt now\nDisperse, I'm going bad, feel me out now\n\n[Hook: Charmelle]\nThis life I live ain't extra\nNo angels to stand next to\nTo live a life that's better\nI'll sacrifice whatever\nThis life I live ain't extra\nNo angels to stand next to\nTo live a life that's better\nI'll sacrifice whatever\n\n[Interlude: LeCoya LeJuene]\nTo say going bad to most ha\nNever been good just getting worst\nThoughts to destroy and to tear things apart\nThoughts to praise, adore and to love\nThe trick is what voice is telling you what\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nMind state of a pirate, I'm irate\nUsed to be cool 'til some straight fool lit the pilot\nWill I be that mid-town bound in the middle of a riot\nOr at a warehouse shipping platinum, and I'm shaking hands with Violet\nNo love for the bane, false foes in the game\nThe Qwest wreck was a shame, twas a journey full of pain\nBut Tech N9ne will remain hella brave and untame so make way\nFor the reign I'm bringing Highland and Wayne\nNo thanks to Qwest they on the receiving end of the gun\nI cursed you, for every time I climb you're getting fired one by one\nBut taking Juan with me 'cause he knows the true meaning of a modern day hippie\nWho creates jewels off mushrooms and bombs sticky\nHog Stylin', Mid West Side and Newday and King Tech and Sway\nThese are the people keeping me alive to this day (Much love)\nQD said \"You can't make rell with a label\nWho let Tipper Gore talk shit and made 'em take Ice T's cop killer off the shelves\"\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nI'm going\nBad\nNo luck, I'm going\nBad, bad, bad\nSo rough I'm going\nBad, bad, bad\nNo church, I'm going\nBad, bad, bad\nDisperse I'm going\nBad\nFeel me out now\n\n[Hook: Charmelle]\nThis life I live ain't extra\nNo angels to stand next to\nTo live a life that's better\nI'll sacrifice whatever\nThis life I live ain't extra\nNo angels to stand next to\nTo live a life that's better\nI'll sacrifice whatever\n\n[Outro: LeCoya LeJuene]\nRight now I can't distinguish which voice I'm listening to\nAm I evil? Or just another lost soul going bad?\nOr just been bad and getting worst?"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\n*phone ring*\n-Yo\n-It's me\n-What\u2019s wrong?\n-I'm just gonna say I'm due in October!\n-Ahh sshh...\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI was kicking it with this chick for a minute\nShe picked me to hit it, real stiffly I sitted\nHe spit then we quit it\nThen I told her to miss me and splitted\nQuickly I lit it up, no problem to get it up\nThen she called and said she needed me to help her get rid of what?!\nA baby! She said she wanted me to kill it\nNo evidence, blood - Don't spill it\nI'm saying at first, I didn't feel it\nBut then I started to ponder on what was coming up yonder\nA baby by a fling made days seem really somber\nSo we both were in agreement, the baby I seen it\nThinking of killing it made me almost fall to the cement\nThis ain't a job I can do myself, I ain't got the brain for this\nSo I called a homie in Kansas who was trained for this\nHe said the way I rap and make skrill for a living\nHe said he kills for a living\nFor the grip span, he's a hit-man\nSo I paid him a fee, he told me what date it would be\nMe and her was down, but I really don't think the baby was G\nSo we three road to Kansas, baby probably thinking we scandalous\nCan't even walk and we band his life\nMan is trife, walked in and he told us to relax\nI sat and he took her and baby to the back\nBefore I came I smoked some dope to calm me\nThey came back and she was baby-less and she was looking like a zombie\nBaby gone (Baby gone)\nWere we wrong? (Hella wrong)\nGotta move on (Gotta move on)\nLet it alone (Yeah)\nI dropped her off but she didn't hate me for killing the baby\nShe said she still wanted to date me, crazy!\nI'm riding and I'm thinking \"Why?!\"\nI took a life but I ain't tweeking\nI know God probably thinking I should die!\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nReal killer (That is me!)\nReal killer (That is me!)\nReal killer (That is me!)\nThis is what you call a what?!\nReal killer (That is me!)\nReal killer (That is me!)\nReal killer (That is me!)\nI don't really give a fuck!\nReal killer (That is me!)\nReal killer (That is me!)\nReal killer (That is me!)\nKnow that ain't nobody iller!\nReal killer (That is me!)\nThat-is-me, that-is-me (Mass murderer)\nThat-is-me! (Natural born killer)\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nA couple of years later, I'm creeping with this chicklet\nLittle thick chick, hit it raw and gave her triplets\nI need to learn to hold my liquid\nSo I called my man in Kansas City, Kan\nI told him I needed him to do it again\nAfter he put 'em away, I asked him\n\"Homie, how could you be so raw?\"\nHe said to me \"How could YOU be so raw?!\"\nWe scattered, one year later I splattered in the same chick\nShe wanted to have it, but I made her do the same shit\nSo I murdered five kids of mine\nI'm 'bout to sit in hell a lifetime bid for mine\nCause of abortion (No more)\nAbortion, now it's blown out of proportion\nInsane... Never again\n\n[Hook]"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWelcome to G-G-G-Gamer\nThe game were either you can be the player, or you can get played\nCaution, if you do engage and you lose\nThis may result in severe heart trauma or distort your way of thinking\nPlay Safely, safely, safely\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI-I-I am a dame-gamer\nPlay the part major heart breaker brain changer\nTake her thoughts make her start they insane anger\nThen they can march, hate can spark, names danger\nYou gotta be fine to get in my chamber\nUntamed ain't no shame when I bang stranger\nBut that's a thousand point, one got it, but the thing drained her\nAnd the game hanged her in the strain of a main claimed her\nNow what you gon' do different? Wonder how well the picture went\nThe one I saw was Twitter sent, saw through mommy like Mr.Kent\nLookin like her kissers were whistling to get liquor bent\nOr wishing for me to stick her in a position to dip I get her hint\nA hundred points she gets cause we connected\nFive hundred points for the number that tech direct texted\nBonus three hundred if she come over and get naked\nBut a stinky crevice took her to nothing, girl take the exit\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI'm a game, she the game\nI'm a player, you not the same\nWho to loose, who to blame\nDon't hate the player, hate the game\nI can be your super lover babe if you just let me in\nBaby it ain't hard to play the game but maybe hard to win\nIt's a roller coaster ride come on as I give it a spin\nPlay it right you get an extra man baby\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nNext player she say shes the best slayer\nShe love when her breasts bare\nWith hot candle wax, that's rare\nSix hundred points when she say her and her girl is a sex pair\nThat'll get you an extra man now we gamin on that there\n\n[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]\nBaby you doing good, stay on it picked up an extra man\nThe only way to use that bonus is if a sexy friend\nEqually fine as you may join us to pass the test\nTo slam fingers in and then out on your own personal message can\nSkype is so exciting and virtual when two tight women ignite\nIn a delightfulness of dyking in about five minutes\nYou might just win it yet, but now your girl looking up tight with it\nLack of participation got your points steadily spiking\nAnd if five hundred points is important\nThen let your mind body and souls free\nKeep your opponents from trying to score these\nMighty sluttin' up with just seconds left on the board 3-\n2-1 and on to the next ones cause these bore me\nBecause\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]\nEleven Hundred points mommy looked smelled and taste good\nBut lost it from telling it all on Facebook\nOne got a dinner, the other from Twitter was using a fake picture\nAnd in the end weren't none of them winners\n'Til I met this girl from Tagged.com\nGot to meet me, whip me, and she be freaky deaky\nGot the dinner, a movie and plus a repeat\nHighest score ever, but I broke the broad\nSay you came close but no cigar my minds primed\n\n[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]\nGaming on ya, even if you got some good head\nHood said you keep the pood fed 'til the woods dead\nIf you happen to get into bed with me\nThen you'll spread quickly and do a medley of ooh and yeahs\nWith me, and that's a thousand points if you get that\nDinner is a thousand mo you can get it if you with that\nGood conversation can probably get you diamond knickknacks\nBut a misshap like bloggin' about how I did that, give my shit back\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nThank you for playing Gamer\nCongrats if you are the winner\nSorry and shit if you are a loser\nIf indeed you failed\nPlease come again\nBut remember\nContinuous play may cause extreme nausea\nAnd often results can be fatal\n-Game Over-"

To get some petroleum\nRodeo circus, these trashy motha fuckas\nTrying to show me they tat's on purpose\nSwastika's here, Swastika's there, minding my affairs\n'Til one shoved me and I said, \"Aw, this is lovely!\"\nI punched him back and said take that from a black\nHis posse ran up I threw my hand up, said let loose the gats\nThey said, \"We're the type of boys that kill 'coons by the hour\nNigger one God, one race, sieg heil, white power!\"\nI said \"Fuck you. Bill Riccio, you spacey ho'\nI heard racist were dying and I'm about to increase the ratio\"\nWhile we were scrappin' I heard, \"coon, monkey, ape, baboon\"\nI heard my partner's lettin' loose they cleared the room\nI let off a couple inside their racist encephalus\nI asked God was I wrong for slaying demons and devils?\nAnd if so, forgive me, but now it's 2 wounded and 3 dead\nFrom shots to the head, these racist mother fuckers bled\n\n[Hook]\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\n\n[Interlude]\n\"Watch that 'boy' shit redneck\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm just a hard workin' brother at Ford\nReport to work pronto amigo in my raggedy Accord\nAssembly working no smirking I get the job done\nWhite folks staring at me like I was Dennis Rodman\n(Fuck it!)\nIt must be the bandana I wear, saying black owned\nSee them whispering everyday but they can yap, yap on\nSaw it comin' a mile away and it figures\nSomebody took a grease pencil and wrote on a car \"Whites own Niggers\"\nPaid it no mind, now it's lunch time I'm eatin' quietly\nThen a voice said \"you don't belong in society\"\nI looked then I felt like gaggin' these white trash mother fuckas\nI heard that he was the grand dragon\nFuck him, I'ma tag him, skull drag him\nBut his recruits equipped with steel toe combat boots\nThis is crazy for four hundred plus we've been infamous\nStigmatism is realism, the idealism is to hinder us\nPut his fingers in my face I bent 'em back\nHe said, \"you fuckin' jerk\" and told me to watch my back after work\nI punched out I walkin' to my car, I'm driving\nAnd I see this mother fucker, he's following me from afar\nPulled over like an idiot jumped out and said, \"what's happenin'!?\"\nWe started scrappin' he cut me with his knife, I took his knife, there goes your life\nGod forgive me because I slit his redneck\nNow all is left is the fuckin' dead peck\n\n[Hook]\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\n\n[Interlude]\n\"I sure do hate to see you like this, what if me and the boys was to shoot that nigger dead?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe demons are gonna kill me, I feel it comin'\nI'm a little piece of love, and a pit full of `em gunnin'\nThe pit is the planet, damnit it's full of killas and racists\nIf God make it I'm saying, God take it break it\nDemoni-acs of all colors, Crippers and Blooders\nArian brothers die, If you fuck with any of us God lovers\nA southern wind, hit the Midwest my mother cringed\n'Cause her vocalist, keep fuckin' with white national socialists\nEverybody wants to be the chosen God's people\nWhen teaching hatred hatred, at the steeple steeple lethal sequels\nWhen churches burn, we purchase germs\nLike guns to slaughter all the mother fuckin' surface worms\nBe warned, all fronts got the right to fall once\nAnd the racist be the ones we call dunce, down to die!\nFor my love so before you cease us\nYou got to what? Crucify me like Jesus leave us rednecks\n\nSeason to kill evil\n\n[Hook]\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\n\n[Outro]\nA lot of people come up to me and they say they're not able to play you know what I'm sayin' the Absolute Power DVD you know what I mean, in the cars and stuff like that\n'cause they wanna hear stuff like you know \"The Grench\" and \"Freaky Lil' Things\" and all that, so you know a lot of people love \"The Grench\" and I love \"The Grench\" and they say it shoulda been on the album, so I put it on this album, you know, since a lot of people love it, it's produced by my homeboy RonnZfromBerlin you know what I'm sizzlin' this is \"The Grench\" check it out mate"

Who about to get swung on?\nHe been eatin' my food\nHuggin' my lil' dude, sleepin' in my bed\nYou been keepin' him fed\nLettin' him get in your head, he about to be dead\nBut no, he was stuck in my townhouse\n'Cause he died young while he was livin' there\nSomebody shot him, got him high\nStuck in the sky, and they ain't even give a care\nBut the soothsayer tell her, \"Stay in prayer\nLight sage, and then make a wish\"\nSaid his name started with an M\nIf you see him there, then you tell him, \"Chris\"\nBirthday is six, six, '06, so he protect in crystal\nDidn't see the ghost myself, but I wish though"

   "lyrics": "[Crystal Watson]\nEnter Everready\n\n[Big Sean]\nSo we rolling, just left Billings, Montana, did a dope ass show\nWe in a 15 passenger van, heading to Spokane, Washington\nWe driving along the interstate, we go over this bridge, hit a patch of ice, all of a sudden the van starts fishtailing\nWe're going back and forth, I'm like \"Woah!\" Krizz says...\n\n[Krizz Kaliko]\n\"You got it Sean you got it! I think you got it man\"\nBut we went sliding further and further towards and back then BOOM we hit\nWe flipped like 5 times, all the windows start breaking out in the van\nI'm like \"Oh god, oh god!\" while we flipping, and finally we stop I'm looking around the van to see if everybody is alright\nFirst person I looked at was Big Nick 'cause I see him jumping out first\nHe runs to the doors 'cause they crushed in and he starts grabbing trying to rip them open like (Grunting noises)\n\n[Big Nick]\nI yank the doors open and I'm yelling out \"Tech! Tech! Are you alright man? Kutt! Kutt! Are you alright?\"\nKutt raises up and I see he's drenched from all the bottles of alcohol we had in the van from last night; and I say \"Kutt man, are you cool?\" and he says\n\n[Kutt Calhoun]\n\"Yeah I'm cool man, I'm cool\"\nSo I'm wiping my face, I'm thinking I'm bleeding\nI look at my hands, it ain't nothing but the liquor\nSo I look around, everybody up and moving\nTech's still on the floor and I'm like, \"Tech! Tech, you alright?\"\nHe ain't saying nothing, I'm like \"Aw man... Tech, you alright?!\"\nHe said something like \"Kutt,\"\n\n[Tech N9ne]\n\"I'm fine man.. I'm fine man, I'm fine, I'm fine.\" I asked him, I said uh, \"anything wrong with my face? Anything on my face?\"\nAnd Kutt was like \"Nah\" So I'm like, I'm listening, and I touch my teeth and I see blood in my mouth, but I'm smiling 'cause I'm hearing Krizz Kaliko saying \"Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus,\"\nAnd it felt good to be in God's graces\nThe ambulance, the people that came, they said that we were all blessed\nYa know what I'm saying, to still be alive after flipping 5 times man\nSo ever since then, we been celebrating life baby Kickin' it hard Every day's a party baby"

D-E-A-D\nAnother S-T-A-T-I-S-T-I-C, that's me\nPuffin' that stronger W-double E-D that hunger\nDon't know how much longer I'll be on this Earth\nBecause I'm the worst type of nigga on this here turf\nSo disperse\n\n[Chorus: Paul Law]\nLiving in misery\nThe worst, the worst, yeah\nThey keep tryna pull me under\nBut I been too long tryna make it over\nThe worst, the worst, yeah\nAfter all that I been through\nI just don't know what the hell to do\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat's why I say F-A-H-Q if you ain't crew\nSome busters on my hit list betta hope it ain't you\nMy pockets thin, about to sin\nI got to spend about like 10\nTo get that Henn, to make that blend\nTo make that fool come up out his ends\nDevilish thoughts, hell is feelin' kinda of crellish\nGod tell us what we got to do to make the motherfuckin' relish\nSpell it out to me 'cause broke is embarrassin'\nI'm psycho like Woody Harrelson\nI can make a comparison\nLike Aaron Yates, Norman Bates, perfect mates\nDippin' up in Ollie Gates\nBitches yellin', head is swellin'\nThinkin' of goin' to hell and bakin' with the beans\nGot me fiend, murder for my green\nSeems, I'm cursed not first\nThe last verse\nI burst, into a blood thirst, but what is it worth?\nNo hearse, nobody's turf\nFuck planet Earth, disperse\nBecause you're dealin' with the worst (the worst)\n\n[Chorus: Paul Law]\nLiving in misery\nThe worst, the worst, yeah\nThey keep tryna pull me under\nBut I been too long tryna  make it over\nThe worst, the worst, yeah\nAfter all that I been through\nI just don't know what the hell to do\n\n[Outro: Paul Law]\nThe worst\nI know that it can't get no worst\nThe worst, the worst, yeah\nAfter all that I been through\nI just don't know what the hell to do"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Tech N9ne & Woman]\nDamn baby, that was real good\n(Mmm, do you think they heard us downstairs, papi?)\nI think they heard us downstairs, next door to that\nAnd next door to that, y'knowmsayin'? (Hahaha)\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nYeah, that was good baby, puss crazy\nCould maybe you turn on the fan cause it's a good 80\nIn here right now, we were steamy like wow\nBangin' like wow, question babe, you my pal, right?\nThis might not sound right, but your girl is down right\nThis clowns type and she right below us hearin' our sexy soundbytes\nAnd Kutty is sittin' down there with her actin' like he just found Christ\nTellin' her he's married so I'm in a hurry to get her frown wiped\nListen, I'm ready to do this thing, enough of wishin'\nDo you think she would come up and get in our fuck position?\nDon't be lookin' at me like I'm crazy baby, it's just suspicion\nAnd I never had eyes for your past homies, but I does for this one\nCause she's a X, the Roman numeral for 10's a X\nAnd the last letter in sex, wanna smash and get her then press\nWhy you lookin' at me like I'm ig-nant? You should be pitchin' this\nTo your homegirl then I can do both of you like a polygamist\nSo are you diggin', it? Do you gotta get twist-ed\nTo get up the nerve to run to her and get her in this, bed?\nLooks like you're stressin' but the Scorpio in me ask the question\nI really like sexin' you but the two of you would be a blessin'\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)\nWhat up with you, girl? I want to enjoy\nWould you tell your girl, to get up wit ya boy\nAnd I'm diggin' on you, but I'm still curious\nYou're lookin' at me like I'm playin' but I'm dead serious\n\n[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]\nNow babe - I'm hoping you don't take this wrong, girl\nBut ever since you came up in here with your homegirl\nI had my eye on you, and her too\nAnd honestly I'm thinkin' that I want you both, girl\nI - know it may sound a little bit ridiculous, a little sick and twisted\nIf you ain't wit it then I would understand\nCause when I'm thinkin' of somethin' a little kinky and freaky-deaky\nYou seem kind of timid but on the other hand\nKnow what they say 'bout them shy ones, and it must be true\nLook at you sittin' there blushin' hard and you smilin'\nWhile your homegirl's sittin' right beside you\nEvery time I look up she's starin' into my eyes and I just\nWonder (Hmmm) do you ladies like to share?\nShower with each other, have you ever took it there? (Yeah?)\nTeamwork makes the dream work\nSo how about we take it to the room - you, me and, her?\n\n[Hook] (2X)\n\n[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nUhh, I'm so street when I speak, my speech scrape the sewer\nI don't wanna meet your girlfriend, I want you to take me to her\nUh-uh, I ain't mature\nI'm gettin' head outside of my ride when I'm drivin', Ace Ventura\nI come from mad Mitten, I move two bad chicks in\nLike \"Three's Company\" honey, I know, I'm (Jack Trippin')\nShe like to try and kiss me, she said her name was Janet\nI said call me Nickel, now let's go find Chrissy\nI'm not gon' lick the box, but I try to keep you happy\nI call my nigga Big Scooby, he'll come and eat your (Shaggy)\nI know I act bold It's just that me, you and her\nMake the perfect combination like a cracked code\nI was taught by them eaters to double yo' plate\nI'mma be cummin' 'til one of you got the Juggalo face\nWoo-woo, I'm just kiddin', though I am persistent, I got a question, listen\n\n[Hook] (2X)"

White dudes be frisking your boo\nCall girl by the night is what she fixin to do\nHomie, re-evaluate it cause your woman might be\nBad for brothas like you good for niggas like me\nLook away partna let your lady go to work\nIt's bout to be the first\nSo baby go on and (twerk)\n\n[Hook x2]\nHey shorty what's your name?\nWhat you willin' to do for me to tip that thang\nYou better twerk sum'n (put some weight on it)\nBaby girl ya better work sum'n (dance for me now)\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nDream girl hey stop put some weight on it\nDon't wanna give it to me mama I'ma wait on it\nBaby you worth it\nNot just cause the way you twerk it\nThis urk a jerk it\nGot me feelin' like you're perfect and I'ma try it\nI know you got a man\nI'll be your man on the side and we can find a place to hide out\nHey and if you slide out\nBaby be careful just what you lyin bout nobody can find out\nSex been part of her since the start of her\nMama was a harlot\nAnd she gave it to her daughter and i love it (i love it)\nSo throw that ass at me and ima throw it back like a quarterback\nCause its lookin' sorta fat\nPay for your schoolin' with the lap dance\nAnd after we can advance to somethin'\nDeep you wantin' me to feed the meter\nPull you away for a minute\nFrom that jerk while you work\nAnd lets to the back and close the curtain cause i love the way you\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Snug Brim]\nDamn you lookin' like youcanova\nSo put the lock on me girl i heard that yous a trooper\nWe in the strip club of course i got plenty chalupa\nYou see these stacks on the table ima let them pursue ya\nMy mouth don't say a word you know what i wanna see\nCome place that pretty round brown right in front of me\nNo disrespect but bend over let me lift the skirt\nI'm fittin' to slap some naked ass while i watch it twerk\n\n[Verse 4: Skatterman]\nWe watch work watch it pop watch it jerk\nLeave a couple thousand on the table you can watch it first\nLil niggas have your fun the skatterman is goin to flirt\nStrange lane in the building all the bitches goin' berserk\nAll day shes a service rep at nextel\nBut when she get home to you she got that sex smell\nExhale nigga get your thumb out your butt\nI know it hurts for you to find out your wife is a slut\n\n[Hook x2]"

Like I'm Dracula 2K\nYour smile is amazing, your eyes are of gazing now\nMade if that was me, you and I would've stayed in back\nLaid in the sack, showing you I recognize how you feel (deeply)\nAbout your love, when I seen your life, what a thrill (peep me)\nI'm so sincere with this, my eyes say I'm ill\nBut I ain't got to be no master of disguise, I'm real\n\n[Hook]\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for myself\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for myself\n\n[Verse 2]\nI love your music girl, when I was falling here\nWhen you play it, got me through this world\nI ain't lying, you's a dime and I ain't trying to compete\nWith the other, some people want it all but I just want you for me\nWhat I wouldn't give to be that dude at the diner with your clothes jeffin' with me\nSunlit smile and low eyes want 'em both reppin' with me\nDreams of us having a night out and you go steppin' with me\nThat dude you got is a lucky man, most definitely\nAnother fox, I can get stuck in her eyes\nKorben Dallas, he couldn't even measure up to my size\nElement 5, I got a place for you\nUnder my chest, plaqued to you\nKnow I'd be complete with your loving, I'd be insatiable\nPromising you joney, i would never ignore you\nGetting your message to the people, I'd be the messenger for you\nMy resident ain't evil, though they crowned me rhyme killa\nHey we got the same name, they call me 9 milla baby\n\n[Hook]\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for myself\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for myself\n\n[Verse 3]\nBlack beauties in rap movies with fat booties\nAre really appealing to Nina but I want that cutie\nOff in the Bronx with C\nI'd be that black that'd get jumped off in the hood\n'Cause I took his bianca to be\nChocolate glazed make me feel I got to get saved\nWhen you sing to me, it clings to me, a lot is displayed\n[?] is disposable, you need loving, I know you do\nKiss you from your toes to your belly\nThat's what I'm supposed to do\nLast but not least, I wish you was my queen\nSee thy king get lost in your lips and your high beams\nBad girl, hardcore, exciting's your writing\nCaramel honey with icing\nMaybe you my soul-mate, maybe I see things\nMaybe I've been plotting you since the BIG scene\nWhat I wouldn't give to become your bronze g-string\nI want you for me, impatiently waiting for your bee sting (bzzz)\n\n[Hook]\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for myself\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for me\nI want you for myself\n\nI want you for myself\n\nThe end"

   "lyrics": "[Intro 1 (Taken from Freaky)]\nI really don't have to tell you much about this one because the song is\nLike the song is like self-explanatory, you know what I mean? It's\nCalled \"My Own Hell\", story about me, and Midwestside, and Hogstyle\nRecords, and people around me, and my wife, and stuff like that, Pretty\nPersonal, real ruff copy, it's the only one we got, you know what I\nMean? I think y'all really love the story\nPeople are nosey and want to\nKnow about my life so check this out; this is called \"My Own Hell\"\nProduced by Don Juan\n\n[Intro 2]\nNigga, my life is straight conflict\nWhen all I want to do is kick it hard and make bomb shit\nEvery perimeter I enter is infested with a sinner\nSeems like I'm losing and never coming out the winner\nShit, I'm the only one kicking it, everyone else plotting and scheming\nBut yet they never listen when I say I'm a little piece of love and a pit full of demons\n\n[Verse 1]\nMidwestside was record company comprised of all friends\nWho grew up together and shared ends\nNobody stepped on nobody's toes\nDiamond was executive producer, Juan had beats I had flows\nScooby and Txx Will did promotion\nGot it where Mitch Bade was the shit and got Kansas City open\nJuan got that shit to Quincy Jones through a chick named Mona\nThree days later Q called us back and it was on\nQ told us to wait on putting the record out indy\nThe record company will make it to where we'll have plenty\nSo we waited, should we put this out? We debated\nBut working with Quincy we were elated\nSo now we on the road to L.A. and it was live\n'Til we got to Quincy's and Diamond told Scooby and them to sit outside\nThat's when the tension started to build\nNiggas started feeling unappreciated and then shit got real!\n'97 Quincy called back for me and Juan\nI told my Rogue Dog niggas just to remain calm\nI'm bout to make it so we can bling, get us nice things\nAnd then Don Juan said, \"let's mash for our dreams nigga\"\nScooby didn't like the way he spent his money on promos\nT-shirts and money to pay Brain for logos\nHe thought he wasn't appreciated, Midwestside depreciated\nGone for the summer and everybody waited\nBakarii didn't like the fact he was down with Mitch Bade\nHe felt that he should be the next nigga to get paid\nTxx Will got tired of being lectured\nOn distribution so the anted up and started Hogstyle Records\nMy niggas wanted me to ride\nHell yeah I'm down, Tecca Nina's on both sides\nHogstyle's like \"Fuck 'em, 'cause they didn't believe in 57\nMidwestside's the same, but the love, I'm trynna find my way to heaven\n\n[Hook]\nYo... This is my own hell nigga, this is my own hell\nJust tryna make my records sell\nOff in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe went to Cali to hook with QD3\nThey wanted the superstar to be me\nKicked it with big Q off in the wild wild west signed me to Qwest\nDidn't know I was in for some more Perspective mess\nQwest fighting Midwestside over a single\nAll the way from the love angel to Kris Kringle\nCEO of Midwestside fighting QD over my budget\nQD fighting Qwest 'cause he never loved it\nWarner Bros. fighting back and forth with my artists\n'Cause the bitch who's handling money's retarded\nQwest don't like Midwestside, QD3 don't like Qwest\nAnd I'm sitting in the middle depressed\nWarner Bros send me four Gs a month\nI'm kickin' it at parties, liquor, weed, and cunts\nWhen everybody's fussing and fighting\nI'm suffering peacefully like Novocaine\nThat's because I didn't know the game\nMidwestside, Juan, and QD3\nQ-W-E-S-T fighting all over me\nSway and Tech tripping with Q over a check he didn't pay\nBut I suffer (Man I suffer)\nYeah, I suffer at the end of the day\n\n[Hook]\nYo... This is my own hell nigga, this is my own hell\nJust trynna make my records sell\nOff in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell\n\n[Verse 3]\nFemale friends started not to like my woman\nWhen they found out my marriage was comin'\nMy wife didn't like my friends from the get go\nShe say them bitches ain't nothing but fucking famous rapper niggas for the grip hoes\nWifey don't like me hanging out with E and Beans\n'Cause when we be seeing E and Beans wifey be seeing things\nBeans don't like Sheryl 'cause Sheryl fine as hell\nAnd Beans thinks Sheryl will take the dick to show and tell\nSheryl don't like Beans 'cause Beans rude\nShe wish Beans would go back to Chicago with her dude\nSayin' he don't like Dr. Wick\nBut Dr. Wick don't give a shit, Zany got Nicky waiting for the hit\nWifey study entire 'cause something seems fishy\n'Cause all my relations iffy iffy\nWifey thinks Big Sonya would try to fuck\nBig Sonya knew if she try wifey was down to buck\nNow all these niggas in my rhyme are my people\nNo one can save them not even a steeple could make 'em equal\nYou're all my sisters, my brothers\nBut I'm tired of mediating, I'ma sit and watch y'all kill each motherfucking other\n\n[Hook]\nYo... This is my own hell nigga this is my own hell\nJust trynna make my records sell\nOff in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell\nThis is my own hell nigga this is my own hell\nJust trynna make my records sell\nOff in my own hell nigga, this is my own hell"

Good tidings I bring\n'Til you cross the line and make me smoke something\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nAnd for your shooby-dooby I got Scooby-Dooby to give that groovy\nUzi tooly to me, shoot the booshy bulley through the booty\nThen \"Hiyah!\" I'm gunnin' you with the Glock brick in the dash\nScreamin' \"Aaah! You son of a bitch you shot me in the ass!\"\nDiablo got the hollow, never trust us kids\nThat'll leave you lost, laying limp, instead of fluffed up jigs\nNow the reason that I ever have to come home to a fucked-up crib\n'Cause I'm creepin', but the haters see my lady and they never have a hushed up lid\nNow the reapin' gotta come down rough, like wife ain't enough, just live\nBut they speakin' hella hated to my ladies because they seductive\nNow we beefin', why you do a nigga shady, like selling me crushed up Thizz?\nGet to chiefin', put the barrel in your mouth, take a hit nigga, puff-puff give\n\n[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]\nSome just smoke the Hookah, others hit the pipe up\nSo when me says you smoke with me, you got to give your life up\nStart to runnin' Mr. Gunman, come to see you smokin' something!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI'm the one that you love when it sing (Yeah!)\nThe evil make the angel wanna smoke something\nBrraa! Brraa! Good tidings I bring\n'Til you cross the line and make me smoke something\nI'm the one that you love when it sing (Yeah!)\nThe evil make the angel wanna smoke something\nBrraa! Brraa! Good tidings I bring\n'Til you cross the line and make me smoke something\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nYeah, show 'em\nReal, back up\nI'm serious, no joke\nLike that, yo\nHow is it that being polite get you in a fight nowadays?\nYou tell them your name like, \"Wassup, I'm Tech N9ne\"\n\"Nigga, I know who your are\" Nigga\nI can't assume that everybody in the world know my name\nI can't be big headed like that, nigga\nJust because you feel bigger, nigga\nThe name is Tech N9ne, suck a dick ahahaha"

Come on! BIANC!\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI like to hit it on flip, don't trip\nI make it worth it, if you nervous I got the service\nThat'll make you work it, you deserve it\nA sex spot to flex wet spots with grip\nStressin' now, 'cause ain't nobody throwin' tips\nYour hips so amazin', I'm gazin', you blazin'\nPraisin' and I no longer shriveled like a raisin\nI'm stoned - hopin' that your homegirl I entered is\nI'm down, even if is Ellen Degeneres\nI'ma clown the punana, pound the pupan\nHate it like a crouton, wise words from God Zoutan\nThe flip baby, no gip baby\nNinna like the way you strip, baby, no way you dip ladies\nSee me in your city, be ready, when I'm looking for some fun\nI be coming at you, five hundred worth of 1's\nJust the trick off, gather your oils to lick off\nYou and your homegirl rollin' with me, jerkin' my dick off\nNot a rip off, just gettin' it tossed the lip gloss\nYour lips lost so deep in it, they callin' me the pit boss\nI'm lovin' it the way you got me shovin' it\nDoggy slip-slide, much obliged\nI cried when I hit it on the flipside\n\n[Chorus: Tech N9ne and Girl]\n(Which side?) Flipside\n(This side) Ladies so I can dip die\n(That's right)\nAin't nothin' thick about the way I like it\nThe jiggle making me fizzle when you make it, make it wiggle a little\nStay on the flipside\n(Which side?) Flipside\n(This side) Ladies so I can dip die\n(That's right)\nThis ain't no ballad talkin' about how I'm in love\nThis is strictly for the strippers in the club, on the flipside\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nMeet me in Las Vegas, I'm stayin' at the Grand\nKeys under Ninna when you be fightin' with your man\nInto it, no undees, get ready to bungy, jump me\nKnew you meant business, when you ripped out my Abercrombie\nHormones hungry, like to get me down under like Crocodile Dundee\nKeepin' your sex weapons from me, I'm grungy\nNot mean and I'm way freaky like zombie\nFriday to Sunday yellin' Tech, I love the way you done me\nAnd then I'm Solomon Grundy, you's a flower when I killed it\nYou wilt it, who got power, call me (Deep Space N9ne)\nOn [?] 'cause I rocked 'em all with socks and all\nY'all 'iancs, I hit the lots of y'all\nSlots, (show 'em, show 'em what you got)\nGirl you makin' it hop, it syncopated with pop non stop\nThis game is silky, I hope you milk me\nI'm fiendin', not killin' me 'cause you\nCan't touch my vibe, if you jockin' Kenin\nI fly in semen, you crying freeman\nIt feels so well, get chills in Hell Screamin' demon\nBefore you nut up I want you to shut up\nAnd give it to me face down, butt up\nI just die, when I hit it on the flipside\n\n[Chorus: Tech N9ne and Girl]\n(Which side?)

(20 to touch my waistline?)\nI can heal it, baby (40 to touch, bust and grind)\n'Bout to kill it, baby (200 bucks a good time)\nI wanna do it baby, stick it baby (Sex on the mind)\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nEnough! Girl you drivin' me nuts\nYou and your homie's hype horny comin' back from peanuts\nWith hokie-pokie, on the brain and we can keep it low-key\nB they hottest when they comin' back from sokey\nWhat up to upholstery, listen closely\nLap dance in the corner, I'm all up on her\nTwo more Coronas, you leaving with me\n'Cause I'm increasing the fee, you leasin' to pee\nHella fat like Jackie, pleasing me\nI admire, what you do call girls, the way you dance\nAnd strip, deck down to your tips, beautiful lips\nYou say that you like it way better from a wild style\nNigga comin' sex-crazed at you on the flipside\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne and Girl]\nCan you feel it, baby? (20 to touch my waistline?)\nI can heal it, baby (40 to touch, bust and grind)\n'Bout to kill it, baby (200 bucks a good time)\nI wanna do it baby, stick it baby (Sex on the mind)"

it's been long overdue baby (that's right)\nLong Overdue (how we do it)\nBut you asked for it\nSo now I gotta give it to you, (give it to you)\nGet Paid\n\n(Verse 1)\nLet me tell you a little story about this nigga I know\nFrom the M and the O\nA chemical nigga who says I got criminal flows\nI'ma set the record straight for a second\nEverybody knows this nigga is hot-headed\nAnd due for a mic checkin\nYou drew first blood in '94\nTrickin with my baby momma\nYou know the one you called a ho\nI'ma let you know\nThat if you take it back to the past\nWhen I was squeezing hella ass and playin hookie\nYou can ask my bro, He will let you know\nBack then I shared my pussy\nYou was using music as a form of pursuing\nPussy sneakin in her bed and beggin for a screwin\nWho the fuck is you foolin?\nI can still make her make you put yo muthafuckin mic down\nStraight interrupt yo show\nAnd serve yo ass in her nightgown\nRight now\nFuck the rappin, we can fight now\nTight style, Sell for miles\nChange the name Vell to Vall\nCall him Dame or Gal\nCause the way he came was foul\nNigga that's bitch shit\nTech N9ne you dissed it\nBut they missed it\nTold me that you sold 200,000 with pride\nBut you lied, I don't mean to hurt yo feelings inside\nBut you sold 5,000 Nationwide\nYou a clown man\nYou niggas think I bluffin, go check the SoundScan\nAll I wanna know is\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy this nigga steady savin his flows for me?\n(He wanna get paid)\nAnd why this nigga basin his whole life on challenging me?\n(He wanna get paid)\nFuckin with 56 Villain get you shota\nMidwest side will chase em down with a choppa\nMotherfucker thinking Teccanina gonna stopa\nSomething wrong with his medullah oblongota\n\n(Verse 2)\nYo\nThis nigga struggling to be the better man\nWhy fuck around with a tech milla meter\nWhen you know the nigga is a clever brand\nNaw, I ain't never ever seen the niggas video\nCause It never ran\nAnd you got the audacity to say Tech N9ne ain't a veteran?\nNigga, I wrote my first rhyme in '85 right\n'86, '87, '88, name me Tech N9ne right\n'89, '90, I was rippin shows, don't you even try cat\n'90 through '99 equals 15 years and I done rapped with some of the best\nMotherfucker can you buy that?\nWe recognize you wanna be the best rapper in Kansas City\nThat's small time\nThat's why yo shit will never be in the hands of many\nMy shit is clean and packs a punch pal\nAnd yeah you right, yo shit's a sloppy rum and drunk style\nThis nigga is failin in the biz\nBets step behind this\nDon't know where his mind is\nThat's why the Nina's bout to tell it like it is\nTech Tech N9ne is\nKansas City's Finest\nAll I wanna know is\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy this nigga steady savin his flows for me?\n(He wanna get paid)\nAnd why this nigga basin his whole life on

medullah oblongota\n\n(Verse 3)\nYo, the fact is we both ain't made no real money\nAnd I'm blastin a nigga which makes the situation real funny\nI'm beginning to see real deal, scrill and real honeys\nAnd you don't wanna get with a nigga that's sick makes you a real dummy\nHe said I worship satan and he worship god that's why we can't work\nNigga that's a cop out, bout to make yo eyes pop out when I whip my cock out\nAnd say I seen you comin out of Roc house\nThis is the third round knockout\nWhen you die and all ya piss, cum, and feces drop out\nTellin motherfuckers we bit (Let's Get Fucked Up)\nFrom yo just locally hit (Bounce, Bounce, Bounce, Bounce)\nKnowin the shit that we spit (Make bitches wanna fuck)\nAnd make niggas get on they grit (And yo shit don't)\nWe officially bumped heads at the Lou Ou\nNiggas are through now\nWho growled at the Holy Temple Bandits Crew style\nNiggas are too foul\nSole and Tech, and you can bet you'll never see em wet\nYou sound like Chuck Rock, with a little bit of DMX\nNow I'ma end this by sayin Regime Life and 56 Vil\nSaid Tech rappin on that niggas payin for him and his kids meals\nI feel bad for the nigga, so I'ma let it out\nA gift from me to you, Ex-Cousin, Retalliate and go get breaded out...\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy this nigga steady savin his flows for me?\n(He wanna get paid)\nAnd why this nigga basin his whole life on challenging me?\n(He wanna get paid)\nFuckin with 56 Villain get you shota\nMidwest Side will chase him down with a choppa\nMotherfucker thinking Teccanina gonna stopa\nSomething wrong with his medullah oblongota\nFuckin with 56 Villain get you shot up\nMidwest side will chase him down with a choppa\nMotherfucker thinking Teccanina gonna stopa\nSomething wrong with his medullah
