  "plain": "If you haven\u2019t heard about Vince Staples yet, you\u2019ve been missing out. Hailing from the LBC, Vince is one of the single best young talents that the West Coast has to offer.\n\nVince has been making waves since his initial breakout with the Odd Future crew and has recently even signed a deal with Def-Jam and the legendary No I.D.\u2019s label Artium. Everything you need to know about how dope Mr. Staples can be found in his ridiculous, breakout verse on \u201cHive\u201d by Earl Sweatshirt. While you\u2019re at it, Vince has released a slew of projects over the course of the past few years, including the Shyne Coldchain series, (both 1 and 2), and the Hell Can Wait EP. It all culminates to his debut album, Summertime 06.\n\nAfter the release of Summertime \u201806, Vince would go on to release his Prima Donna EP which would feature one of hip-hop\u2019s biggest artists, A$AP Rocky.\n\nVince would then go on to release Big Fish Theory on June 23rd, 2017. The album featured even bigger names than the Prima Donna EP. Kendrick Lamar, Juicy J, Ty Dolla $ign, and even another project with A$AP Rocky on it.\n\nVince has a rather small award count, with only winning one and being nominated for another. In 2014 BET would give him the award \u2018Best Impact Track\u2019 for his song \u201cKingdom\u201d. The Black Reel Awards would later nominate him for \u2018Best Original or Adapted Song\u2019 with his song \u201cWaiting for My Moment\u201d which was adapted from the movie Creed.\n\nDespite him believing he should have won or been nominated for a Grammy for his album, Big Fish Theory, it was not nominated. Vince doesn\u2019t think it should have been nominated for \u2018Best Rap Album of the Year\u2019 but rather \u2018Best Electronic Album of the Year\u2019.\n\nVince started off March of 2018 with a huge bang. He released a song called \u201cGet The Fuck Off My Dick\u201d which had a $2 million GoFundMe page attached to it with a line saying \u201cGet off my dick or fund my lifestyle\u201d."

Where the hoes? Where the bitches?\nEvery real nigga know the difference\nBandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen\nReal Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo\nCocaine color of a Creole\nT-Skrap moving for the d-low, and he know\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nFrom the city where the skinny carry strong heat\nNorfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHit the corner, make a dollar flipping\nSplit the dollars with my mama children\nFolks need Porsches, hoes need abortions\nI just need y'all out of my business\nNever no problem playing no bitches\nNever no problem spraying no witnesses\nNo face, no case, been with the shit\nHopped out broad day, then emptied clips\nCut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash\nSchool wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun\nKnow a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say\nBut they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way\nSo we put an AK where Kiana and them stay\nAnd that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me\nHow I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me\nPistol popping, Poppy Street\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nFrom the city where the skinny carry strong heat\nNorfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me\nPolice still scared 'cause of niggas like me\nIn the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger\nYou ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?\nYou ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smoking out the city\nRiding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky\nLil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet\nNaughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check\nFronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet\nAll my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet\n'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks\nSorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk\nDid it, got away with it out the Civic\nWe Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit\nPark Ramona, Pop-block the corner\nGiving hell 'til it's frozen over\nI ain't never ran from nothing\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nI ain't never ran from nothing but the police\nFrom the city where the skinny carry strong heat\nNorfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)"

Shit\nThey only fucking with the rapper if the rapper rich\nOr got a platinum hit\nA chain or two\nSeem the music interchangeable\nRaging bull, what you headed for?\nHeaven doors, or hell below\nI write directions for the road to let you know\nEdgar Allen Poe\nTried to warn 'em of demise and all he seen was crows\nFeel for 'em, words, we kill for 'em\nLeave the bitchin' to the birds, we still war'n\nBorn ready, you boys lost already\nAll in 'til the lord get me\n\n[Outro: Andre 3000]\nPut my Glock away I got a stronger weapon\nThat never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: Vince Staples]\nCrabs in a bucket\n\n[Verse 1: Vince Staples]\nCrabs in a bucket\nWanna see you at the bottom, don't you love it?\nWhen they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encore\nSendin' shots but you at the top floor\nLet 'em pop shit, give me some drums to go pop with\nNeed white women at the shows unconscious\nIf not that then topless, earned all this\nGet with that or get in the moshpit\nWhere's your moxie? Ain't you from Poppy?\nYoung man, you not actin' too cocky\nProlly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash\nRead a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash\nIf I'm feelin' funny, guaranteed gon' flash\nCock back, blast, put 'em in a bag\nProlly gon' regret it in the retrospect\nGot a lot of problems I ain't let go yet\n\n[Verse 2: Vince Staples]\nSpend a lot of money on the CDG\nAin't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?\nBattle with the white man day by day\nFeds takin' pictures doin' play by play\nThey don\u2019t ever want to see the black man eat\nNails in the black man's hands and feet\nPut him on a cross so we put him on a chain\nLying to me, sayin' he don't look like me\nRollcage on the GT3\nHow a show on stage like a DVD?\nPut me in the MoMA when it's over with\nI used to look up to the sky, now I'm over shit\n\n[Outro: Kilo Kish]\nRemember that I still got you\nI still got you here\nIt's rare they'd come across you?\nI kept you hidden in my head\nDrowning in my own ocean\nI forgot to care\nAnd you can drop the anchor, baby\nI know what's under there\nIt never really crossed my mind to think\nMaybe you'd avert your glance at me?\nEver really cross your mind\nEver really cross your mind\nI ain't never had no chance to breathe"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\nHow you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day\nSometimes I feel all alone\nSometimes I can't get away\nI feel my life is in danger every night when I lay\nSo can you do me a favor, smile for me?\n\n[Verse]\nI know they wanna see me fall, I know they fraudulent, I know\nI know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go\nI know my pigment is not that of a businessmen\nI know they think I'm ignorant I'm fucking up my privilege\nI know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo\u2019\nI made enough to know Ill never make enough for my soul\nI turned my back on my friends\nI turned my back on my home\nI left the streets where I've grown\nTo chase the yellow brick road\nI heard they paved it with gold I turned around and seen they pissed on it\nJust like me\nBut that's alright because my soul burning please set me free\nI hope to see you in another life times mines just not for me\nCan\u2019t you see?\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery night up on my knees I pray\nSmile for me\nThat everything will change and be ok\nSmile for me\nMaybe I'll stay maybe I'll pass away\nSmile for me\nI'm holding on to what the pastor say\nSmile for me\n\n[Bridge]\nSmile for me\nSmile for me\nSmile for me\nSmile for me\n'Cause when life gets hard\nAnd you just think\nYou wanna end it all\nSmile for me\nWhen life gets hard\nAnd you can\u2019t breathe\nYou wanna end it all\nSmile for me\nSmile for me\n\n[Break]\nHow you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day\nSometimes I feel all alone\nSometimes I can't get away\nI feel my life is in danger every night when I pray\nSo could you do me a favor, smile for me?\n\n[Outro]\nI don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up\nWish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched\nPeople tell me I'm too young and I should live it up\nHow could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nDon't say you feel my pain cause I don't even feel myself\nBlood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nMotion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame\nSalt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up\nSometimes I feel like giving up"

Some shit that I don't believe\nWhat my master say? Nigga, you won't be free\nUntil you pass away, razor on my sleeve\nTryna compensate, this pain, it run so deep\n\"But you a star,\" they say, \"You mean so much to me\nMean so much to me\""

Did you pray for it? Get twerking\nAnd a nigga gotta sit and wait for it, is it worth it?\nWhy I ask when I already know?\nDon't mind me, mind already gone\nNigga better not keep calling your phone\nHave my dogs in the yard at his home\n\n[Chrous: Kilo Kish & Vince Staples]\nBaby\nBaby\nBaby\nBaby\nYou know you drive me crazy\nYou know you drive me crazy\nYou know you drive me crazy\nYou know you drive me crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Vince Staples]\nGirl, you looking like something out of King\nMagazine, fifteen in the magazine\nHope a nigga don't run up tweaking\nI'm tryna have a good time this evening\n91 Freeway, eastbound, speeding\nLate night, but the face right, I need it\nMando, I'm the man, though, you see it\nNiggas wanna kill me, so I gotta keep it\nI ain't really into clubs or the nightlife\nOnly kick it with the thugs, I ain't never did a drug\nWhen you doing what I does, need your mind right\nThey won't ever catch a nigga at the stoplight\nWhat your life like? Would you ride for a nigga?\nDie for a nigga?

We were in love\nYou know what I mean? We were together, so-\nWhen it- and that's like a real drug, isn't it? So when it- when it didn't come together, I was just like...\nYou know? It really hurt\nBut I needed enough distance from it\nSo that it wasn't like raw emotion anymore\nBut not enough distance that I'd forget\nI'm quite a self-destructive person, so I guess\nI guess if you give me some material...\n\n[Verse: Vince Staples & The Temptations]\nRaindrops on my windowsill\nLonging for your nature's feel\nLoved that song when we were kids\nNow it makes me want you here\nSometimes, people disappear\nThink that was my biggest fear\nI should have protected you\nSometimes, I wish it would rain\nSunshine, blue skies\nPlease go away\nSometimes, I wish it would rain\nThe girl has found another and\nGone away\nWith her went my future\nMy life is filled with gloom\nSo day after day\nI stay locked up in my room\nI know to you"

Southern California livin'\nDaddy in and out of prison, ain't a father to my style\nI'm the ODB of the OPB\nWhen I go OT, all the shows sold out\nAnd the hoes show out, tryna be a baby mama\nTryna break a player pockets, that's a no no\nThis day forward, I ain't takin' photos\nAnd we wear our own clothes, we ain't givin' promo no mo'\n\n[Chorus: Vince Staples, (Kilo Kish) & A$AP Rocky]\nJust the same old thing (way up, way up)\nWatch me do the same old thing\nDo the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)\nWatch me do the same old thing, just the same old\nSame thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)\nSame old\nSame thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)\nChain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing\n\n[Verse 2: Vince Staples]\nWin the race or fix your face, your woman on my dinner plate\nI'm comin' for that last supper, center seat, I've been a G\nI traffic 'cross the interstate\nWe cracked and launched the murder rate\nThey know who did the killin', but they didn't see\nWant a verse? Issa price. Want a show? Issa fee\nWe don't do no bargain shoppin', we don't show no empathy\nEmpty out your pockets, $10,000 fee for that talkin'\nEye contact is an extra five\nNo doubt in mind, we the best alive\nNo testifyin', we solid\nNever told on my partners\nMy partna them got bodies\nI'm tryna put 'em in 'Raris\nThey used to put us in G rides, so now I put 'em in college\nPut 'em on with this business then put 'em on with your mama\n\n[Chorus: Vince Staples, (Kilo Kish) & A$AP Rocky]\nJust the same old thing (way up, way up)\nWatch me do the same old thing\nDo the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)\nWatch me do the same old thing, just the same old\nSame thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)\nSame old\nSame thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)\nChain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing\n\n[Outro : Kilo Kish]\nWay up, way up\nWay up, way up"

You ain't ever push nobody's scalp back\n45, 9s 'round 9 in the AM\nYesterday I sat and prayed, today I'm finna take it\nA week ago, they killed my bro, that's been the price of bangin'\nSince my granny Alameda days, robbin' cause we need a raise\nFingers do the talkin' when the Cs do the walkin'\nAnd the Cs been polluted, baptism for these shooters\nSeventh grade, I went to OCA, hoopin' up at Lueder's\nWith my Ru from Campanella we was crashin' shit together\n\n[Interlude Sample]\nThree, two, three, zero\n\n[Verse 2]\n3230 Poppy St, we ain't chasin', they brought the beef\nUsed to the sounds of violence, my neighbors ain't never call police\nCall it followin' protocols, spark it if you don't know the call\nGot this bitch that live off of Market that's down to hold the heat\nTurnin' water and power off, got us impatient, powered up\nEvictions notices go unnoticed, the final hours up\nLivin' off of borrowed time, committin' crimes that's organized\nFortress wasn't fortified, just tryna build my castle up\nDollar and a dream, at night time we maskin' up\nThe deadly game of tag, the older generations passed to us\nI got a clip that's long enough to shoot until the casket come\nWith it 'till that casket drop, they droppin' when that magnum pop"

At the end of the day, I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from here. So they can't do nothing but, you know, look down on us. We look at them, we see somebody that could help; they look at us and all they see is a nigga. But it don't really matter anyway. We all gon' die one day, man. One day.\n\n[Verse 2: Vince Staples]\nDo doves cry when a Black man die, or do we croak with crows?\nThe young catch gunshots, the old catch the Holy Ghost\nHo, I love not, I never seen no pot of gold\nJust bar windows and six-fours with no switches\nWas broke with no bitches; she love me, though\nYou'll kill me if it make you richer\nWhat you screaming you my brother for?\nHeart is where the hatred is, the brain'll stain the love below\nAnd life is what you make it, so I'm making money for my folks\n\n[Chorus: Vince Staples]\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make my momma proud, feel like her only son\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nWith everything I need, with everything I want\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo do it like nobody has ever done\n\n[Interlude 2: Vince Staples]\nWhen most people look at a person who does what I do, they look at us with these preconceived notions, as if it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day, so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You looking at a person, telling them that they story don't matter, really no better than me, walking down the street tryna shoot at somebody. 'Cause all we got is these dreams, man, and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing. And that's the last thing you want for anybody is to not really have nothing at all.\n\n[Verse 3: Vince Staples]\nI been through Hell and back, I seen my momma cry\nSeen my father hit the crack, then hit the set, then flip the sack\nI done seen my homies die, then went on rides to kill 'em back\nSo how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?\nWe live for they amusement like they view us from behind the glass\nNo matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past\nSo in this cage they made for me exactly where you find me at\nWhether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back\n\n[Chorus: Vince Staples]\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make my momma proud, feel like her only son\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nWith everything I need, with everything I want\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo do it like nobody has ever done, nobody has ever done"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI asked my mama what's the key to life, she told me she ain't know\nShe just try to take it day to day, and pray I make it home\nMade me wonder for a second, til I felt my weapon\nFalling out my pocket, then walked inside my room before she saw it\nNever had a happy home, stability's a problem\nEvictions from apartments, prison letters from my father\nAll a nigga ever knew, if it wasn't for Rashard or Ray\nI probably would be shot today, they taught a loc survival\nMy teachers said I had a vibrant mind, but a tarnished shine\nDoing violent crimes, put the money in my pockets\nGave it to my mom, but when a nigga had a chance\nNever asked where it was from, happy that I lent a hand\nThe day my grandfather died, I grew into a man\nAround the same time I first pulled a trigger\nI prayed it didn't hit him, but after awhile I ain't care\nAs long as a nigga still here, right?\n\n[Verse 2]\nNever had belief in Christ, cus in the pictures he was white\nSame color as the judge that gave my hood repeated life\nSentences for little shit, church I wasn't feeling it\nWhy the preacher charge tell us everything gon be alright\nKnew what it was for, still I felt that it was wrong\nTill I heard Chef call himself God in the song\nAnd it all made sense, cus we can't do shit\nBut look inside the mirror once it all goes wrong\nYou fix your own problems, tame your own conscience\nAll that holy water shit is nothing short of nonsense\nNot denying Christ, I'm just denying niggas options\nCus prayer never moved my Grandmama out of Compton\nI prayed for my cousin, but them niggas still shot him\nInvest in a gun, cause them niggas still got them\nAnd won't shit stop em from popping you in broad day\nHope that choir pew bulletproof or you gon' pay\n\n[Verse 3]\nMoney was the motive, Florence, California, cutting corners\nTrying catch a nigga slipping just to blaze him that Sabonis (what?)\nChamber long as Tommy Chambers nigga meet your maker\nAs-Salamu leave em lakeside, bells can't save em\nWhen them shells start raining, guess my mama didn't raise me right\nToo busy paying Christ to wash away her sins\nBut I'm the only one that's fucked up in the end?\nThat's the shit that happens when you put a book before your kids\nThe only girl I ever loved turned into a bitch\nIf I ever see her and I got a gun, she getting hit\nThat's as honest as it gets, I've done a lot of shit\nI ain't proud of, but I wouldn't trade it in for Heaven\n11 Mac-11's, and a Tre 57\nBet that shit will get to talking if you ever got a question\nNever met a person worth trying to impress\nSo consider this a murder when it's 5 inside your chest"

   "lyrics": "[Produced Branden BeatBoy]\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe was more beautiful than anything I've ever seen\nWas the dream I had longed for, for many years\nHow it broke my heart to see her shed a tear\nBut she deserved it, I wasn\u2019t perfect, nah, I never been\nSo tell me why the Hell was you expecting that?\nBitching and complaining, seems to me like you perfected that\nIf I would\u2019ve knew I would have never got so damn attached\nFound out that she loves me not, now I'm in this Cadillac\nPlease don\u2019t panic pretty lady, I won\u2019t do no stupid shit\nJust wanna be the one you love, one you hug, one you kiss\nIt\u2019s funny cause ever since you left I even miss the shit you used to do to piss me off\nThey say an un-tampered love is lost, so I'm not downing you\nReally though, I'm happy that you found a dude, but anyway\nIs the rope a little tight, it seems as if your wrists are bleeding\nAnd I hope the tape around your lips doesn't constrict your breathing\nNot much room, but the trunks filled actually\nThat's why I got you in the back seat, love taxi\n\n[Bridge]\nThat's why I got you in the back seat\nNo\nDon't you know I love you so\nSo tell me why you wanna go\nDon't leave me, alone\n\nThe screaming stopped, blood pouring from the razor slitting\nBut why the frown, you should be\u2026\n\n[Verse 2]\nSitting here, loathing in this ambiance\nStaring at this shrine of miscellaneous body parts\nI think of how we got of to such a sloppy start\nAnd which seems worse, a slit throat or a tarnished heart\nI guess I got the raw end of the deal\nBecause this pain'll last forever, yours ended in shrills\nNow my life's a nightmare, but it seems so real\nOur love was full force, yet you chose to yield\nSo we crash, face first, blood on the dash\nI guess the best lesson in life, is nothing will last\nFast forward to this fucked up position I'm in\nContemplating why to live when I'm living in sin\nBut shit, niggas like me wasn't meant to go to Heaven\nWe was meant to be alone, die hanging from a ceiling\nTry praying for forgiveness, but God told me to shut up"

Rather drive drunk bumpin' some Brandy\nGoing hard in the paint like I'm Olowokandi\nSay, \"Hi\" to the big black forty when it click-clack\nPush a nigga's wig back, pray for his family\nCatch his mom slippin' turn him to Bambi\nProlly slam it like Camby, cocaine flow\nHoes propane blow, Peggy Hill\nAll my weapons kill come and test it nigga\n\n[Speaking Interlude]\nBy the way, mixtape December 30th...you're welcome\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm that shit Frankie Lymon was stuffing up his arms\nFirearms snuck in the luggage just for the fuck of it\nI'm who would be runnin' shit if Jason took a day off\nCruisin' with that Tommy Gun, rip a nigga's face off\nVanilla Sky, got 'em high, Glock named Paula\nSit inside of my tinted ride I squeeze it she be moanin'\nKelly Slater trynna rock the top, sharks start swarmin'\nNow you stuck in deep water with a smooth barracuda\nCustom Bape, German Lugers levitate, meet your maker\nMasturbate, let 'em mace ya\nBitch so she can grade in greatness, Sick cum\nGuard-dog swag, but never bit none\nYour bitch cunt, ask her where she got that shit from"

Yeah I'm feeling the love\nHope I get to take it with me when my living is done\nPray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done\nAnd I hear you cheering for me when my victory come\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\n\n[Verse 2]\n2006 I said I had to get my money right\nShit I refuse to hear my stomach growl another night\nMight put that burner right up in your mouth and free your mind\nThen run your pockets, I ain't stoppin' 'til my kids is fine\nCollege was a plan of mine until I seen them fees\nEverything I ever needed, I done learned out on them streets\nOnly price was loss of sleepin', homies plottin' so I keep it on me\nClosely play this game for keeps, I take the shot, you be the goalie\nGoals I gotta reach, but this girl up in my sheets asleep\nMom up on her way to work, if she say bye before she leave\nThen this my last day on this earth, I'm way too young for plantin' seeds\nIs what she used to tell me, shit, but when I ever listen?\nPlayed a lot of roles in life but never played the victim\nNever paid a toll for stripes, I earned them on them lonely nights\nMac rounds tear the house down like a poltergeist\nLife is what you make it, just depend on how you roll the dice\n\n[Hook]\nIs you feeling amazing? Yeah I'm feeling the love\nHope I get to take it with me when my living is done\nPray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done\nAnd I hear you cheering for me when my victory come\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nFeeling the love\nLove\nLove\nLove\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nLove\nLove\nYeah I'm feeling the love"

Pay attention\nMost the time that I've been living we been public housing tenants\nNever had no pot to piss so bitch excuse me if I brag a lot\nNiggas never had a shot unless you talking .38 that Wak had got\nCan't get passed them pearly gates, neglecting what your pastor taught\nBut you gon' smoke your weed still and you gon' sip your lean still\nSo I'm gon' hold this heat 'til they make me take my seat in prison\nDoing shit my way till 25 to life what I'm facing, baby\nMy temper short, that anger made me have days in court\nIn my hood spill blood a sport and the killer's face can show no remorse\nGot student loans and you failed the course\nOf course you dropped out like 6 am and you see the cops out\nNiggas been turnt up, no need to stop now\nSpeed up, skeet up then air the block out\nEl Camino creeping with your homies in your backseat\nOnce you hit that corner watch them niggas turn to athletes\nMake him run his pockets, take his wallet then his house keys\nStaking out his mama house, we taking every damn thing\n\n[Hook: Jhene Aiko]\nOh, you scared, ain't ya?\nOh, you scared, ain't ya?\nOh, you scared, ain't ya?\nOh, you scared, ain't ya?\nYou getting bread, ain't ya?\nYou getting bread, ain't ya?\nAin't ya? Ain't ya?\n(Nigga, where my money at?)\n\n[Verse 2: Vince Staples]\nIf Illuminati buying souls and only fear was dying broke\nAnd God who made my life this hard so hell where we decide to go\nCould you really judge us knowing us then close to what was given\nFather up in prison, Jesus here, but he ain't struggle wit us\nThe church only made shit worse\nThe money we was given ain't go to God\nMostly nice cars that Reverends could sit in, destined for jail\nWe just some niggas facing sentence, we sitting at a standstill\nYou broke, but you the man still trying to find your plan still\nTwo kids and mo' bills, food stamps and dope deals, hood life with no frills\nBut still they swear they feel you and never been close to near you\nOnes who preach protect and serve, the main ones trying to kill you\nIt ain't no path to life, no prepping for no afterlife\nIt ain't no wrong or right, it's just the shit you do and shit you don't\nFriends that's killing niggas is the only ones you praying for\nBut words, they never stopped no bullet\nOh, you scared, nigga?\n\n[Hook]"

John Lennon of my fucking trap\nCan you roger that, Roger Mayweather hands hard\nHitting when I go to bat, you niggas notice that\n\n[Hook: Kilo Kish]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNever fuck with niggas who can point out where your momma live\nThe shooters, cause 9  times out of 10, you lose her\nThat murder ain't a thing, got the Shawn Kemp Ruger\nAt the trap off Hoopa, fully loaded when I shoot it\nFeel that loud hadouken ho, real trill, you should know\nSince my days at optimal academy\nPicture like Maddux with a magnum in the black Ford Galaxy\nI hope he rages, ain't no point in dodging when I grab the 3\nShoot the 3, Reggie Miller 93, 31, 32\nHarold Miner quick release, run and shoot\nSo if I was you, I would try and pay attention\nNiggas trying to catch a buzz, I'm just trying to catch you slipping\n\n[Hook: Kilo Kish]"

Know they waitin' on my demise\nAnd I been waiting too, my patience through, blue paisley noose in the sky\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nMartin Luther had a dream, I thought Tookie dream was better\nBunchy Carter had a plan, but they shot him 'fore he led us\nTo that Ghetto Promise Land, it ain't no hope for the darker man\nJust the folks who you bump for the Arm & Hammer, the nigga prolly gone die when his mama had em'\nThat pissy mattress fit 3 or 4, taking shit when we leave the store\nAin't a shoulder to lean up on, chauffeur in the back, the police been called\nSame ol' gauge, same ol' trigger, same ol' cage, brand new nigga\nFront page when you kill em', mothafucka pay attention\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nNiggas die off of Poppy street\nBet my mama vouch, they drive by\nWe don't run inside, bitch, we shoot it out"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nJust riding around in a convertible Corolla\nWaiting for the light to change, hopefully my luck will change\nWent to sleep pissed off, woke up broke as fuck again\nBeing mediocre is some shit I'll never understand\nNever had a 9 to 5, never did an application\nAnd rather rob a nigga, when I get the chance, teacher's tell you\n\"Get a plan, go to college, let them empty out your pockets\"\nWhat the fuck I look like, nigga? For real\nIt's safe to say I put my heart in the trap but\nHow in the hell could you fault me for that when\nIt takes money to be shit and we never seen it\nSo I'm doing dirt, let the police clean it\nStanding on the edge of a tall cliff\nTrying not to fall deep into the shark pit\nI guess I'm God's gift to Hell in a funny way\nCan't wait to see my life change once the money came\n\n[Hook: Mike G]\nNiggas only come around when the money's 'round\nCatch you slipping 'round the town just to gun you down\nWasn't fucking with me then but I bet by now\nThese mothafuckas know they like my style\nTryna figure out, What the hell they want from me\nWhy I love everything that involves money?\nHope I get enough just tryna live it up\nShit I want yours too, you should give it up\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe said she like money, I like Hummer's, you want to trade?\nJust another disappointment in my fucking day\nSlave to my lifestyle, would try and make a change\nBut I heard about the shit they doing to the runaway's\nSwear that I would change everything if my gun could stay\nSaid she doesn't understand, anything I fucking say\nProblems with women, she's tripping but get's pissed\nCause I tell that she just a bitch, and never really meant much\nBut if I told you that I loved you would you give a fuck?\nOr even have the decency to listen up? Probably not\nI swear like every time you come around my fucking heart will stop\nCan't wait 'til I make way and the talking stops\nBut for now I just stare you down in the parking lot\nFrom a far distance, just hoping, just wishing\nThat maybe you might not think I'm crazy\nI know you probably wish for the same thing but fuck it\n\n[Hook]"

Go to hell\nBitch now you not no blue can shrell (?)\n\nAnd a cell is where my mind is, trapped along timeless\nWords spoken kindess to these women, the finest\nBloodlines and mysteries, her murder was a mystery\nLone wolf traveler, a lady-heart damager"

Niggas running with the police\nWe gunning with the police,  Daytons on the gold jeep\nRide solo, cause nigga's known to squeal\nUp in that glass room, singing like soul for real\nStill, I made a promise to my momma that I'd never go to jail\nSo a nigga won't, burning shells, 'til I burn in hell\nHad to double up my personnel for the clientele\nNigga's want it coming off the scales and need the sales\nPack a zip and ship it in the mail like report cards\nAnd they said we wasn't gon' go far, yeah right\n\n[Outro]\nBut they gon' love you when you gone nigga, right?"
