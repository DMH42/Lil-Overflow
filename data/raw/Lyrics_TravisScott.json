 "description": {
  "plain": "Jacques Berman Webster II (born April 30, 1992), popularly known as Travis Scott (previously stylized as Travi$ Scott) is a rapper and producer from Missouri City, Texas, located within the Houston Metropolitan area. Scott began producing and releasing beats via Myspace at 16.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles after dropping out of The University of Texas at San Antonio following his sophomore year, adopting the name Travi$ Scott in homage to his uncle named Travis, and his musical idol Kid Cudi (real name Scott Mescudi).\n\nTravis Scott dropped out of the University of Texas at San Antonio without his parents knowing and moved to Los Angeles to make music. His parents made a surprise visit to see their son at his former university. They eventually found out that he lied to them. They cut off support towards him from that time on. He ended up sleeping on couches and lived miles away from people he knew.\n\nWith some help of fellow southern rapper T.I., Scott signed to Epic Records and T.I.\u2019s label, Grand Hustle. After, he acquired the number of Kanye West\u2019s engineer, Anthony Kilhoffer. With Anthony\u2019s help, Scott was able to co-produce tracks on G.O.O.D. Music\u2019s debut album Cruel Summer. After his appearance on the label\u2019s album, Travis signed to G.O.O.D. Music under a producer contract and along with West\u2019s help, he released his debut solo mixtape Owl Pharaoh.\n\nHe released Days Before Rodeo on August 18, 2014, anticipating the release of his debut album entitled Rodeo, which was released September 4th, 2015.\n\nScott released his highly anticipated sophomore album Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight on September 2, 2016, after previewing it the same morning on the .WAV Radio show on Apple\u2019s Beats 1 platform. The album was an Apple Exclusive and was available exclusively on Apple Music for a week before its full rollout on all other marketplaces and streaming services.\n\nTravis' third studio album ASTROWORLD was released on August 3rd, 2018. The album was a critical and commercial success, selling half a million copies in its first week, and peaking at #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nLa Flame is also the CEO of Cactus Jack Records, a record label that counts Sheck Wes, Don Toliver, Luxury Tax 50 and Chase B on its roster."

Promises?)\nGet down, I'm prayin' (Get down, I'm prayin')\nLet me tell the lost tale about Jacques\nLet me tell you how I turned Scott\nHow I went down on the block\nWaterfall around ten o'clock\nAnd how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah\n'Fore a nigga had the locks (Just ask the lonely)\n'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops\nAlways kept my city on me like it was a swatch (Just ask the lonely)\nEvery time we in the party, took it up a notch\nNow I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (Oh-oh)\nWanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box\n(Don't pray for love)\nTired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)\nAnd fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)\nMama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (Just ask the lonely)\nI'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor\nYou always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow (Just ask the lonely)\nAnd anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow\nPray for love\n\n[Bridge: Travis Scott & The Weeknd, Travis Scott, The Weeknd]\nNo, oh, oh (Woah)\nWe don't pray for love, no more, no more (Woah, woah, woah)\nWe don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton (You don't wanna see no more)\nWe don't wanna see you on the news (No more, no more, no more, no more), all alone\nHm, no, no, no, no, no, no, hm, no, no, no, no, no, no (Just ask the lonely)\nHm, no, no, no, no, no, no (Just ask the lonely)\nHm, no, no, no, no, yeah\n\n[Verse 3: The Weeknd]\nUnderrated is an understatement\nThey tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid\nThese niggas fiends watching all of my moves\n'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day\nI'm right here, you know where I stay\nAnd if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way\nShe like my show lights, she wanna be wifey\nShe know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life\nSo I pull out for the climax, faster than a hi-hat\nSorry, baby, I don't play\nAnd if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'\nAnd my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me\nMy niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce\nLike they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys\nThey never pray for us, nobody pray for us\nNobody pray, no, no, no, no, no\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nOh, oh, don't pray for love (Oh, oh)\nOh, oh, say it loud (Oh, oh)\nJust ask the lonely\nJust ask the lonely, oh-oh (Just ask the lonely)"

   "lyrics": "[Intro: T.I.]\nNine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system\nWe find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized\nWith a story of a young rebel against the system\nRefusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority\nHe chose the mood of \"Fuck this shit\"\nAt that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott\nChose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls\nIn the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey\nAin't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life\nBut wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nNo monogamy, m\u00e9nage with me\nPornography surrounding me\nYou get high with me, you come down with me\nThat's all I need in my fantasy\nAll these flashing lights\u2014, lights\u2014, lights\u2014\nGive you some of me, you want all of me\nAnd get high with me and come down with me\nYeah, that's all I need in my fantasy\n\n[Verse 1: Travis Scott]\nYou remind me of my ex, crazy love\nWe designed our love around the drugs\nWe both in this club, we both tryna fuck\nI'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nNo monogamy, m\u00e9nage with me\nPornography surrounding me\nYou get high with me, you come down with me\nThat's all I need in my fantasy\nAll these flashing lights blinding me\nGive you some of me, you want all of me\nAnd get high with me and come down with me\nYeah, that's all I need in my fantasy\n\n[Interlude: T.I.]\nThe story of the bastard was never told\nThe soul of a bastard was never sold\nWill he survive, or will he fold up?\nLiving like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed\nSit sip at the top, a long list of no named\nMisfits can't wait to get a chance to say \"Fuck you\"\nTo the ones who say \"Fuck you\"\n'Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels\nWho leads the charge of this young mob?\nLa Flame, he hears in his head, \"The world is yours\" (Yours, yours)\n\n[Verse 2: Travis Scott]\nWake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga\nNiggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga\nI'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic\nI might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish\nIt's the rodeo, time to get started\nHouston nigga goin' James Harden\nThey was wildin' on us niggas in the projects\nWonder why a nigga went cold-hearted\nThey wanna put my soul up on an auction\nBut I'ma make 'em take the fall like August\nAnd they gon' vote me right in on my caucus\nAnd I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless\nWhy your hands out, asking could you hold one?\nWho do I owe? Nigga, no one\nThey bigging you up but you low down\nAnimated acting frozen\nI got porno pics, wish I can post them\nStackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em\nNiggas askin' for the old him\nBut I'm way too young to be the old him\nI'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom\n'Til I climb to the top of the podium\nSo wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga\nNiggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga\nI'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic\nI might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish\nWe gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world\nWe gon' rule the world, hmm\nNever gonna stop, never gonna stop, never ever gonna stop it!\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nLa Flame says, \"Let your ambition carry you\""

Thank you to my little brother for being the most animated person I know. Thank you to my Dad for being the best and craziest Dad I have ever known. Thanks for teaching me everything I know. Can't forget about Wanda Webster, my amazing mom. Thanks for putting up with my shit. Thanks for spending every dime on me. Thanks for coming to my rescue every time. I love you, sooooooooo fucking much. I wouldn't know what I would do if I didn't have you. To my Aunt Debra and Uncle Travis, my inspiration when I grow old. I wanna be happy and caring like you. To my Grandmother, I'm glad y'all are still here to witness the kid get dizzy. I love you Uncle Allen and Aunt W love y'all. W wish you were around to capture the pictures of the kid growing. To my brothers for life J-Will, J-Rich, Dozie, Chase B, Ashton, we finally did this shit from T Lock up in my motherfucking night, eating that double cheese and hitting that wing stop, sweating in what we knew was the pit. We did it niggas, time to take it to the next level billion dollar mindset. To my new found brothers Easy, David, Marc, Corey, Daniel, Bizzy, thanks for holding it the fuck down. I owe you a fucking ton. Y'all have a crazy amazing soul. I wouldn't have survived a day without y'all. To my nigga Sickamore, thanks for being down since day one, believing in a nigga mad early when everybody called us crazy. You stood by us. Thanks for dropping everything to come complete this mission. To Laurie, my lawyer, thanks for holding it down early when I came in with nothing before I even knew I was going to be an artist.

(Last night)\n\n[Chorus]\nNow-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)\nYou only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)\nNow-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)\nIf you don't give a fuck about (If you don't give a fuck about)\nNow-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)\nYou only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)\nNow-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)\nIf you don't give a fuck about (If you don't give a fuck about)"

   "lyrics": "Now, I\u2019m lost, Jacques Berman Webster II, most definitely lost\nI see the needle sway and\u2005they\u2005tell me I\u2019m\u2005all I got. This is my\u2005name, so, this is who I must be, I should\u205flisten.\u205fThis\u205fis just an\u205fintro to myself,\u205fthat much is clear. And if I can go get away from myself, I might find something worth bringing back home, but my problem is that my mind is moving at max speed. The air is moving slower the faster my feet move. My Air Max 270s keep me grounded to this hypothetical floor. I\u2019m hovering at the layer between what\u2019s real and what I made up, which are the same being that much I know. And I should be lost on purpose, intention, made it across the universe like perfect, made you wish rehearsed it because it really does look so perfect. My imagination is a burden that has me lost and uncertain, but what nourishes me is Houston. What\u2019s the difference between being lost and escaping? An attention. What\u2019s the difference between a ladder and an elevator? Labor. Feel free to feel lost, it\u2019s free, there\u2019s no cost. The cacti fell over on the path, that\u2019s how I noticed I can fly. The truth is, your always home. I create a city with no buildings or people, just deep breaths and daydreams, nightmares and ancestors\u2019 energies fly and memory. I can get away, I can make it, whether it\u2019s outdated and I\u2019m Jaded, or I become the air and I made it. It maxed out our system like I twisted the mission and made the decision to be free or like other people who can\u2019t see it, they call it, they say I\u2019m lost now. When I laugh my breath mixes with clouds and causes a storm, because I\u2019m not lost, I escaped. Keep your feet where you stand, everything else has escaped"
